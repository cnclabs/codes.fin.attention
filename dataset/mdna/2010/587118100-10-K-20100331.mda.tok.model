overview we had revenues of  million and net earnings of million in fiscal  compared to revenues of  million and net earnings of million in fiscal and revenues of  million and net earnings of million in fiscal a depressed economic and retail environment continued in fiscal with high unemployment  tight credit conditions and low consumer confidence negatively impacting consumer spending during the year 
in response to these challenging business conditions  we continued efforts to stimulate sales with discounts and promotional events as we also managed our inventory purchases  maintained expense control efforts and reduced capital expenditures 
we opened stores in fiscal  stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal in addition  during fiscal we applied a new store design which was tested in three k g stores in fiscal to approximately additional k g stores 
the new store design establishes a modern look and feel from the exterior entrance of the store to the inside of the fitting rooms 
we believe these new design elements convey a more vibrant and energetic attitude to our customers 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related to store assets for men s wearhouse and tux stores and k g stores 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related mainly to store assets for two k g stores 
no asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal the more significant factors impacting these charges are discussed below 
refer to impairment of long lived assets as discussed in critical accounting polices and estimates below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
of the total million non cash asset impairment charges in fiscal  million related to k g stores 
the asset impairment charges in fiscal and resulted primarily from sales declines at the k g stores that started in fiscal and continued in fiscal and fiscal due mainly to the recessionary trend of the us economy 
the remaining million of asset impairment charges in fiscal related to store assets for of the men s wearhouse and tux stores open at the end of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we renamed our stand alone tuxedo rental stores to men s wearhouse and tux 
these stores were acquired in april or opened subsequently and operated as mw tux from the fourth quarter of fiscal until the first quarter of fiscal when they were renamed men s wearhouse and tux 
these stores offer a full selection of tuxedo rental product as well as an expanded selection of retail merchandise  including formalwear and suit separates  dress shirts and ties targeted towards a younger customer  which was introduced during the first quarter of fiscal it was anticipated that expanding the retail merchandise at the rental stores and renaming them to men s wearhouse and tux would diminish or possibly reverse a consumer driven shifting of rental revenues that was occurring from the rental stores to our men s wearhouse stores located in close proximity one mile or less 
although the expanded merchandise offering contributed to a significant increase in retail clothing sales by the rental stores in fiscal  the shifting of tuxedo rental revenues from the rental stores to near by men s wearhouse stores continued to occur 
in total  tuxedo rental revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  however  million of store assets for of the men s wearhouse and tux stores open at the end of fiscal were impaired due mainly to the shifting of rental revenues 

table of contents the net assets for of the total stores impaired in fiscal are fully impaired and comprise million of the total million pretax impairment charge 
the remaining net book value of the assets for the stores that are not fully impaired totaled million at the end of fiscal changes to our key assumptions related to store performance  market conditions and other economic factors could result in future impairment charges for these partially impaired stores as well as for other stores where the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in  we closed four men s wearhouse stores due to lease expiration and one k g store due to substandard performance 
we also closed men s wearhouse and tux stores one due to substandard performance  nine due to lease expiration and due to consolidation of operations with other existing men s wearhouse stores in the area 
in  we closed two men s wearhouse stores due to substandard performance 
we also closed men s wearhouse and tux stores seven due to substandard performance  one due to lease expiration and due to consolidation of operations with other existing men s wearhouse stores in the area 
in  we closed stores due to the integration of after hours into our operations and two men s wearhouse stores and one k g store due to lease expirations 
during the second quarter of  we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party who assumed our liability for unredeemed gift cards that had not yet reached their statutory escheatment term 
as a result of this agreement  we are no longer subject to certain third party claims for unredeemed gift cards  which allows us to recognize other income from breakage of gift cards when the likelihood of redemption of the gift cards is remote 
pretax breakage income of million was recognized during fiscal refer to gift cards and gift card breakage as discussed in critical accounting polices and estimates below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
we expect general economic conditions to remain difficult in in response to these challenges  we plan to continue efforts to stimulate sales with discounts and other promotional events  to manage our inventory purchases  to continue expense controls and to limit our capital expenditures 
we plan to open approximately men s wearhouse stores in fiscal and to expand and or relocate approximately existing men s wearhouse stores  one existing men s wearhouse and tux store  five existing k g stores and seven existing moores stores 
we also plan to increase the ladies assortment of merchandise in of our k g stores and to introduce a limited assortment of deeply discounted european luxury brand merchandise in certain k g stores 
we plan to close one men s wearhouse store  seven k g stores and approximately men s wearhouse and tux stores in the next months as their lease terms expire  and approximately additional men s wearhouse and tux stores will be closed if acceptable lease termination arrangements can be established 
based on our experience with previous economic downturns  we believe long term fundamentals for the men s specialty apparel industry remain strong and that current negative conditions will stabilize over time 
however  we cannot predict when a meaningful recovery will occur

these inventory purchases will be funded by cash from operations  trade credit and  if necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility

additionally  market conditions may produce attractive opportunities for us to acquire assets or retail chains larger than our past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
we may use cash on hand  together with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt or equity securities  to take advantage of any significant acquisition opportunities 
the continued weakness of current economic conditions  including high unemployment levels  reduced consumer spending and tightened credit markets  could negatively affect our future operating results as well as our existing cash and cash equivalents balances 
in addition  conditions in the financial markets could limit our access to additional capital resources  if needed  and could increase associated costs 
we believe based on our current business plan that our existing cash and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our planned store openings  other capital expenditures and operating cash requirements and that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement for at least the next months

the table assumes our long term debt is held to maturity 
b we lease retail business locations  office and warehouse facilities  copier equipment and automotive equipment under various noncancelable capital and operating leases 
leases on retail business locations specify minimum base rentals plus common area maintenance charges and possible additional rentals based upon percentages of sales 
most of the retail business location leases provide for renewal options at rates specified in the leases 
our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
c other contractual obligations consist primarily of payments required under our marketing agreement with david s bridal  inc d excluded from the table above is million  which includes million in interest  related to uncertain tax positions 
these amounts are not included due to our inability to predict the timing of the settlement of these amounts 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
e in february  we entered into several month noncancelable capital leases for certain automotive equipment used for product distribution 
total minimum future rental payments under these leases  excluded from the table above  are approximately million  which includes million in interest  resulting in a net capital lease obligation of million 
the minimum future rental payments under these leases  which are excluded from the table above  are approximately million for each of the fiscal years     and none thereafter 
in the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders to vendors suppliers for merchandise 
the purchase orders represent executory contracts requiring performance by the vendors suppliers  including the delivery of the merchandise prior to a specified cancellation date and compliance with product specifications  quality standards and other requirements 
in the event of the vendor s failure to meet the agreed upon terms and conditions  we may cancel the order 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the noncancelable operating leases  other contractual obligations and letters of credit discussed above  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its financial position or results of operations 

table of contents inflation the company believes the impact of inflation on the results of operations during the periods presented has been minimal 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in many instances  this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under our current business model 
however  because future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results will differ from our estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events 
historically  we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable 
our critical accounting policies  which are those most significant to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and those that require significant judgment or complex estimates by management  are discussed below 
revenue recognition clothing product revenue is recognized at the time of sale and delivery of merchandise  net of actual sales returns and a provision for estimated sales returns  and excludes sales taxes 
revenues from tuxedo rental  alteration and other services are recognized upon completion of the services 
we present all non income government assessed taxes sales  use and value added taxes collected from our customers and remitted to governmental agencies on a net basis excluded from net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
the government assessed taxes are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities until they are remitted to the government agency 
gift cards and gift card breakage proceeds from the sale of gift cards are recorded as a liability and are recognized as net sales from products and services when the cards are redeemed 
our gift cards do not have an expiration date 
prior to the second quarter of  all unredeemed gift card proceeds were reflected as a liability until escheated in accordance with applicable laws and we did not recognize any income from unredeemed gift cards 
during the second quarter of  we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party who assumed our liability for unredeemed gift cards that had not yet reached their statutory escheatment term 
as a result of this agreement  we are no longer subject to certain third party claims for unredeemed gift cards 
accordingly  beginning with the second quarter of  we recognize income from breakage of gift cards when the likelihood of redemption of the gift card is remote 
we determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns 
based on this historical information  the likelihood of a gift card remaining unredeemed can be determined months after the gift card is issued 
at that time  breakage income is recognized for those cards for which the likelihood of redemption is deemed to be remote and for which there is no legal obligation for us to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to any relevant jurisdictions 
gift card breakage income is recorded as other operating income and is classified as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of earnings 
pretax breakage income  including a cumulative adjustment of million recorded in the second quarter of  of million million net of tax or per diluted earnings per common share was recognized during fiscal gift card breakage estimates are reviewed on a quarterly basis 

table of contents inventories our inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the average cost method for approximately of our inventory and on the retail inventory method for the remaining primarily k g inventories 
our inventory cost also includes estimated buying and distribution costs warehousing  freight  hangers and merchandising costs associated with the inventory  with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience  as to items in our inventory that may be damaged  obsolete or salable only at marked down prices and reduce the cost of inventory to reflect the market value of these items 
if actual damages  obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates  additional inventory write downs could be required 
in addition  buying and distribution costs are allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to inventory cost 
if this ratio were to change significantly  it could materially affect the amount of buying and distribution costs included in cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles with finite useful lives  are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows  which is generally at a store level 
store assets are reviewed using factors including  but not limited to  the company s future operating plans and projected cash flows 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to that store  compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of a store does not exceed the carrying value of the assets  full or partial impairment may exist 
if the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined using an income approach  which requires discounting the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales  costs and useful lives of assets 
significant judgment is also involved in selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining the estimated fair value of an asset 
changes to our key assumptions related to store performance  market conditions and other economic factors can significantly affect our impairment evaluation 
for example  unanticipated adverse market conditions can cause individual stores to become unprofitable and can result in an impairment charge for the property and equipment assets in those stores 
no asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related mainly to store assets for two k g stores still in operation 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related to store assets for men s wearhouse and tux stores and k g stores 
the pretax asset impairment charges for the k g stores of million in and million in are the result primarily of sales declines that started in and continued during and caused mainly by the recessionary trend of the us economy 
we plan to close at least five of the impaired k g stores at the lease end or kick out date over the next months 
all the store assets for these k g stores are fully impaired 
the fiscal pretax asset impairment charges related to the store assets for the men s wearhouse and tux stores were million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we renamed our stand alone tuxedo rental stores to men s wearhouse and tux 
most of these stores were acquired in april or opened subsequently and operated as mw tux from the fourth quarter of fiscal until the first quarter of fiscal when they were renamed men s wearhouse and tux 
these rental stores offer a full selection of tuxedo rental product as well as an expanded selection of retail merchandise  including formalwear and suit separates  dress shirts and ties targeted towards a younger customer  which was introduced during the first quarter of fiscal it was anticipated that expanding the retail merchandise at the rental stores and renaming them to men s wearhouse and tux would diminish or possibly reverse a consumer driven shifting of rental revenues that was occurring from the rental stores to our men s wearhouse stores located in close proximity one mile or less 
although the expanded merchandise offering contributed to a significant increase in retail clothing sales by the rental stores in fiscal  the shifting of tuxedo rental revenues from the rental stores to near by men s wearhouse stores continued to occur 
in total  tuxedo rental revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  however  million of store assets for of the men s wearhouse and tux stores open at the end of fiscal were impaired due mainly to the shifting of rental revenues 
we plan to close approximately rental stores in the next months as their lease terms expire  and approximately additional rental stores will be closed if acceptable lease termination arrangements can be established 
most of the store assets for the rental stores planned to be closed were impaired in fiscal 
table of contents the net assets for of the total stores impaired in fiscal are fully impaired and comprise million of the total million pretax impairment charge 
the remaining net book value of the assets for the stores that are not fully impaired totaled million at the end of fiscal changes to our key assumptions related to store performance  market conditions and other economic factors could result in future impairment charges for these partially impaired stores as well as for other stores where the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values 
trademarks  tradenames and other identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives of to years using the straight line method and are periodically evaluated for impairment as discussed in the impairment of long lived assets section above 
goodwill  which totaled million at january   represents the excess cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in prior business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated annually as of our fiscal year end for impairment 
a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred 
such events or circumstances could include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated changes in the competitive environment  decisions to significantly modify or dispose of operations and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 
for purposes of our impairment evaluation  the reporting units are our operating brands identified in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands 
the goodwill impairment evaluation is performed in two steps 
the first step is intended to determine if potential impairment exists and is performed by comparing each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and we must complete the second step of the testing to determine the amount of any impairment 
the second step requires an allocation of the reporting unit s first step estimated fair value to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the estimated fair value over the amounts allocated to the individual assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 
in our step one process  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combined income and market comparable approach 
our income approach uses projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions 
the market comparable approach primarily considers market price multiples of comparable companies and applies those price multiples to certain key drivers of the reporting unit 
we engage an independent valuation firm to assist us in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
management judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process 
the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions 
critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include the potential future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the income approach relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in revenue  gross margin and expense 
the cash flows are based on the company s most recent forecast and business plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our impairment evaluation are reasonable  however  variations in the assumptions and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is affected by changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants 
given current economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term 
the weighted average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows ranged from to for the analysis 

table of contents selection of comparable companies within the industry 
for purposes of the market comparable approach  valuations were determined by calculating average price multiples of relevant key drivers from a group of companies that are comparable to the reporting units being analyzed and applying those price multiples to the key drivers of the reporting unit 
while the market price multiple is not an assumption  a presumption that it provides an indicator of the value of the reporting unit is inherent in the valuation 
the determination of the market comparable also involves a degree of judgment 
earnings multiples of to were used for the analysis 
as discussed above  the fair values of reporting units in were determined using a combined income and market comparable approach 
we believe these two approaches are appropriate valuation techniques and we generally weight the two values equally as an estimate of reporting unit fair value for the purposes of our impairment testing 
however  we may weigh one value more heavily than the other when conditions merit doing so 
the fair value derived from the weighting of these two methods provided appropriate valuations that  in aggregate  reasonably reconciled to our market capitalization  taking into account observable control premiums 
therefore  we used the valuations in evaluating goodwill for possible impairment and determined that none of our goodwill was impaired 
we also performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a change in these assumptions within selected sensitivity testing levels would not impact our conclusion 
the goodwill impairment evaluation process requires management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of the reporting units 
actual values may differ significantly from these judgments  particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units 
sustained declines in the company s market capitalization could also increase the risk of goodwill impairment 
such occurrences could result in future goodwill impairment charges that would  in turn  negatively impact the company s results of operations  however  any such goodwill impairments would be non cash charges that would not affect our cash flows or compliance with our current debt covenants 
no impairment was identified in fiscal  or tuxedo rental product the cost of our tuxedo rental product is amortized to cost of sales based on the cost of each unit rented  which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the average cost of the rental product 
lost  damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales 
tuxedo rental product is amortized to expense generally over a two to three year period 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience and information obtained from tuxedo rental industry sources  as to the number of times each unit can be rented 
if the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates  it could materially affect the amount of tuxedo rental product amortization included in cost of sales 
self insurance we self insure significant portions of our workers compensation and employee medical costs 
we estimate our liability for future payments under these programs based on historical experience and various assumptions as to participating employees  health care costs  number of claims and other factors  including industry trends and information provided to us by our insurance broker 
we also use actuarial estimates 
if the number of claims or the costs associated with those claims were to increase significantly over our estimates  additional charges to earnings could be necessary to cover required payments 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
the deferred tax assets are reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those tax benefits is uncertain 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since  in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
interest and or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining our uncertain tax positions 
we have established accruals for uncertain tax positions using our best judgment and adjust these accruals  as warranted  due to changing facts and circumstances 
a change in our uncertain tax positions  in any given period  could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows for that period 
operating leases our operating leases primarily relate to stores and generally contain rent escalation clauses  rent holidays  contingent rent provisions and occasionally leasehold incentives 
we recognize rent expense for operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which is generally five to ten years based on the initial lease term plus first renewal option periods that are reasonably assured 
rent expense for stores is included in cost of sales as a part of occupancy cost and other rent is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the lease terms commence when we take possession with the right to control use of the leased premises and  for stores  is generally days prior to the date rent payments begin 
rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period are recognized as rental expense 
deferred rent that results from recognition of rent on a straight line basis is included in other liabilities 
landlord incentives received for reimbursement of leasehold improvements are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
contingent rentals are generally based on percentages of sales and are recognized as store rent expense as they accrue 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a standard regarding the fasb accounting standards codification codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this standard identifies the source of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of non governmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap in the united states 
in addition  this standard establishes the fasb codification as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by non governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
this standard was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  but will affect our financial reporting process by eliminating all references to pre codification standards 
as of the effective date of this standard  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards  and all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
in may  the fasb issued a standard regarding accounting for subsequent events 
this standard is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for selecting that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this standard is effective for interim periods ending after june  in february  the fasb issued an accounting standards update regarding accounting for subsequent events  which eliminated the requirement to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in the financial statements 
the accounting standards update was effective upon its final issuance 
the adoption of the standard and the accounting standards update did not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued guidance regarding accounting by lessees for maintenance deposits 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this guidance concluded that all maintenance deposits within its scope should be accounted for as a deposit and expensed or capitalized in accordance with the lessee s maintenance accounting policy 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  which provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per common share pursuant to the two class method 
the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
all prior period earnings per common share data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively 
early application of this guidance was prohibited 
we adopted this guidance on february  we calculated basic and diluted earnings per common share under both the two class method and the treasury stock method for fiscal  noting no significant difference on the basic and diluted earnings per common share calculations 
this guidance has not been applied to prior years as the impact is immaterial 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for earnings per common share disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued guidance which deferred the effective date of the fasb statement regarding fair value measurements for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this guidance 
we adopted this guidance for non financial assets and non financial liabilities on february  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk moores conducts its business in canadian dollars 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  then the revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline 
interest rate risk we are also subject to market risk as a result of the outstanding balance of us million under our canadian term loan at january   which bears a variable interest rate see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our cash requirements for interest payments 
for example  an average increase of in the variable interest rate would increase our interest expense and payments by approximately million 
at january   there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we also have exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates as those rates relate to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
as of january   we have highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet 
future investment income earned on our cash equivalents will fluctuate in line with short term interest rates
