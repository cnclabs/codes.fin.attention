item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction 
fonar was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  health management corporation of america  also referred to as hmca  formerly known as us health management corporation  in order to expand into the physician and diagnostic management services business 
fonar s principal mri products are its stand up r upright r mri and fonar tm mri scanners 
the stand up r mri allows patients to be scanned for the first time under weight bearing conditions 
the stand up r mri is the only mri capable of producing images in the weight bearing state 
at tesla field strength  the upright r mri and fonar tm magnets are among the highest field open mri scanners in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality 
fonar s open mri scanners were the first high field strength mri scanners in the industry 
hmca commenced operations in july  and generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services  including development  administration  accounting  billing and collection services  together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients 
revenues are in the form of fees which are earned under contracts with hmca s clients 
since july  hmca has engaged only in the management of mri facilities 
for the fiscal years ended june  and june   and  respectively  of hmca s revenues were derived from contracts with facilities owned by dr 
raymond v 
damadian  the president of fonar and hmca and principal stockholder of fonar 
the agreements with these mri facilities are for one year terms which renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated 
the fees are based on the number of procedures performed in the case of one scanner located in georgia at the rate of per mri scan 
the fees for the sites owned by dr 
damadian in florida are flat monthly fees ranging from  to  the balance of hmca s revenues are derived from contracts with mri facilities purchased by dr 
robert diamond from dr 
damadian 
the mri facilities owned by dr 
diamond are charged a flat fee  pursuant to new contracts executed in connection with the sale of the mri facilities at the end of fiscal the fees are reviewed and if appropriate  adjusted on an annual basis by mutual agreement 
during fiscal  these fees ranged from  per month to  per month 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue from sales contracts for our mri scanners  under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue  as each sub assembly is completed 
amounts received in advance of our commencement of production are recorded as customer advances 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   we recorded a valuation allowance which reduced our deferred tax assets to equal our deferred tax liability 
we amortize our intangible assets  including patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs  over the shorter of the contractual legal life or the estimated economic life 
our amortization life for patents and capitalized software development costs is to years and years  respectively 
we periodically assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and management agreements  when there are indications of potential impairment  based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of impairment is calculated by comparing anticipated discounted future cash flows with the carrying value of the related asset 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  and future prospects  in addition to other economic factors 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced a net loss of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net income of million on revenues of million for fiscal this represents a decrease in revenues of 
included in net income for fiscal is a gain of million recognized by the company on the sale of a consolidated subsidiary 
decreased unrelated party product sales of was the principal factor accounting for the decreased revenues of the company 
related management fees increased by 
in addition  total costs and expenses decreased by 
our consolidated operating results worsened by million to an operating loss of million for fiscal as compared to an operating loss of  for fiscal discussion of operating results of medical equipment segment fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  with product sales revenues decreasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal service revenue  however  increased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in revenues was attributable to a decrease in sales of our upright r mri to unrelated parties  offset by an increase in service and repair fees 
the upright r mri is unique in that it permits mri scans to be performed on patients upright in the weight bearing state and in multiple positions that correlate with symptoms 
an important event in our ongoing effort to educate both the medical community and payors about the benefits  if not necessity  of utilizing upright r mri scanning  occurred in fiscal when we sold an upright r mri scanner to the largest orthopedic hospital in the netherlands  st 
maartenskliniek 
upon placing the order  the chairman of spine surgery at st 
maartenskliniek expressed the view that for their hospital to continue to engage in spine surgery without fonar s upright r mri technology  now that it was available was unacceptable and that owning the scanner was not optional  but mandatory 
he further stated that once our active research program has discovered the benefits of this new fonar technology for patients  we intend to publish the results in a lot of peer reviewed scientific journals 
in addition  significant progress is being made in developing the fonar tm mri scanner so that it can be used in interventional procedures 
at the oxford nuffield site in the united kingdom  where we installed the first fonar tm mri  fonar software engineers have completed and installed our nd generation tracking software  which is designed to enable the surgeons to insert needles into the patient and accurately advance them under direct visual image guidance to the target tissue  such as a tumor  in order to inject therapeutic agents directly into the tissue 
product sales to unrelated parties decreased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal there were no product sales to related parties in fiscal or we believe that one of our principal challenges in achieving greater market penetration is attributable to the better name recognition and larger sales forces of our larger competitors such as general electric  siemens  hitachi  philips and toshiba and the ability of some of our competitors to offer attractive financing terms through affiliates  such as ge capital 
nevertheless  no other competitor offers a whole body weight bearing mri scanner such as the upright r mri 
the operating results for the medical equipment segment decreased by million from an income of  in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal this decrease is attributable most significantly to a decrease in our scanner sales offset by a smaller decrease in our total costs and expenses 
we recognized revenues of million from the sale of our upright r mri scanners in fiscal while in fiscal  we recognized revenues of million from the sale of upright r mri scanners 
none of our revenues for fiscal and fiscal were attributable to sales to related parties 
license and royalty revenue in fiscal decreased to  million as compared to million in fiscal the license has expired and consequently we expect no license and royalty revenue in research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  decreased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  fonar s new hardware and software product  sympulse r and new surface coils to be used with the upright r mri scanner 
discussion of operating results of physician and diagnostic services management segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to the company s physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the renegotiation of some of the management contracts between hmca and its clients 
presently  of the mri facilities managed by hmca have upright r mri scanners 
cost of revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for our physician and diagnostic services management segment increased from million or of related revenues for the year ended june  to million  or of related revenue for the year ended june  the increased revenues resulted from these increased marketing efforts 
operating results of this segment decreased from an operating loss of  in fiscal to operating loss of million in fiscal we attribute the decrease to an increase in our cost of revenues greater than our increase in revenues 
discussion of certain consolidated results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal interest and investment income decreased in compared to we recognized interest income of  in as compared to  in fiscal  representing a decrease of 
interest expense of  was recognized in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  representing a increase of 
while revenue decreased by  selling  general and administrative expenses  decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal compensatory element of stock issuances also increased from approximately  in fiscal to  in fiscal this reflected fonar s policy to refrain from using its stock bonus plans to pay employees and others  in order to prevent dilution of its outstanding stock  even though there was an increase in the use of bonus stock in fiscal the higher provision for bad debts of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  reflected an increase in reserves of certain indebtedness in fiscal by our physician and diagnostic services management segment 
in fiscal  the three florida sites managed by hmca jointly and severally guaranteed the payment of their management fees to hmca  further securing hmca s management fee receivables 
revenue from service and repair fees increased from million in fiscal and to million in fiscal as scanners previously under warranty entered into service agreements with hmca 
continuing our tradition as the originator of mri  we remain committed to maintaining our position as the leading innovator of the industry through investing in research and development 
in fiscal we continued our investment in the development of our new mri scanners  together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development   of which was capitalized  as compared to   of which was capitalized  in fiscal the research and development expenditures were approximately of revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment  and of total revenues  in and of medical equipment segment revenues  and of total revenues in fiscal this represented a decrease in research and development expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal  necessitated by our cost cutting programs 
notwithstanding the decrease in research and development expenditures  in connection with our overall cost cutting programs  we remain fully committed to developing new features  software and upgrades to improve its products 
the physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  revenues increased  from in fiscal to million in fiscal this is primarily attributable to the renegotiating of several management contracts between hmca and its clients 
we have been taking steps to improve hmca revenues by our marketing efforts  which focus on the unique capability of our upright r mri scanners to scan patients in different positions 
marketing expenditures are likely to increase  as the company continues its efforts to promote sales 
in the beginning of fiscal  in july of  hmca sold the portion of its business engaged in the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities to health plus management services  llc for a purchase price of million  payable pursuant to a promissory note payable in monthly installments 
the first twelve installments were interest only and the remaining payments were to consist of equal installments of principal and interest in the amount of  each 
pursuant to a modification agreement dated august   health plus made a prepayment of  on the note and received a discount of  in return 
a new note was executed for the balance of the indebtedness remaining  in the amount of  providing for consecutive equal monthly payments of principal and interest of  each 
in october  an additional discount of  was given and the note was paid in full 
the note was repaid by mountain crest ventures  of which a principal member is a related party 
in fiscal and  hmca received no revenue from the physical therapy and rehabilitation business 
the company s management fees are dependent on collection by its clients of fees from reimbursements from medicare  medicaid  private insurance  no fault and workers compensation carriers  self pay and other third party payors 
the health care industry is experiencing the effects of the federal and state governments trend toward cost containment  as governments and other third party payors seek to impose lower reimbursement and utilization rates and negotiate reduced payment schedules with providers 
the cost containment measures  consolidated with the increasing influence of managed care payors and competition for patients  have resulted in reduced rates of reimbursement for services provided by the company s clients from time to time 
the company s future revenues and results of operations may be adversely impacted by future reductions in reimbursement rates 
certain third party payors have proposed and implemented changes in the methods and rates of reimbursement that have had the effect of substantially decreasing reimbursement for diagnostic imaging services that hmca s clients provide 
to the extent reimbursement from third party payors is reduced  it will likely have an adverse impact on the rates they pay us  as they would need to reduce the management fees they pay hmca to offset such decreased reimbursement rates 
furthermore  many commercial health care insurance arrangements are changing  so that individuals bear greater financial responsibility through high deductible plans  co insurance and higher co payments  which may result in patients delaying or foregoing medical procedures 
we expect that any further changes to the rates or methods of reimbursement for services  which reduce the reimbursement per scan of our clients may partially offset the increases in scan volume we are working to achieve for our clients  and indirectly will result in a decline in our revenues 
in  the obama administration announced its intentions for healthcare reform in the united states 
legislation adopting healthcare reform was passed in on march   president obama signed into law healthcare reform legislation in the form of the patient protection and affordable care act  or ppaca 
the implementation of this law will likely have a profound impact on the healthcare industry 
most of the provisions of ppaca will be phased in over the next four years and can be conceptualized as a broad framework not only to provide health insurance coverage to millions of americans  but to fundamentally change the delivery of care by bringing together elements of health information technology  evidence based medicine  chronic disease management  medical homes  care collaboration and shared financial risk in a way that will accelerate industry adoption and change 
there are also many provisions addressing cost containment  reductions of medicare and other payments and heightened compliance requirements and additional penalties  which will create further challenges for providers 
we are unable to predict the full impact of ppaca at this time due to the law s complexity and current lack of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance 
moving forward  we believe that the federal government will likely have greater involvement in the healthcare industry than in prior years 
in addition  the use of radiology benefit managers  or rbm s has increased in recent years 
it is common practice for health insurance carriers to contract with rbms to manage utilization of diagnostic imaging procedures for their insureds 
in many cases  this leads to lower utilization of imaging procedures based on a determination of medical necessity 
the efficacy of rbms is still a high controversial topic 
we cannot predict whether the healthcare legislation or the use of rbms will negatively impact our business  but it is possible that our financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected 
at the present time healthcare reform has not directly affected our business  but we believe uncertainty as to the ultimate impact of healthcare reform  taxes  and the state of the economy have hurt our scanner sales 
there can be no assurance that the impact of health care legislation or possible reimbursement changes will not adversely affect our business 
as a result of our loss for the year  fonar does not expect to meet nasdaq s criteria for continued listing and anticipates that nasdaq will commence delisting proceedings 
fonar will attempt to avoid delisting and seek additional time to come into compliance or an exemption if possible 
if fonar cannot maintain its nasdaq listing it will seek to qualify for inclusion in other trading markets 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by from million at june  to million at june  marketable securities approximated  as of june   as compared to  as of june  cash used in operating activities for fiscal approximated million 
cash used in operating activities was attributable to a decrease in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of million and a decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts of  offset by the net loss of million and an decrease in customer advances of million 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal approximated million 
the principal uses of cash from investing activities were purchases of property and equipment of  costs of capitalized software development of  and costs of patents and copyrights of  the principal source of cash provided by investing activities was the proceeds from note receivables of million 
cash provided in financing activities for fiscal approximated  the principal sources of cash in financing activities were proceeds from the long term debt of  and proceeds of  from repayment of notes receivable by employee stockholders  offset by the repayment of borrowings and capital lease obligations of  total liabilities decreased by during fiscal  from approximately million at june  to approximately million at june  the decrease in total liabilities reflected principally an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts of from million at june  to million at june  offset by a decrease in customer advances of from million at june  to million at june   resulting from our decreased backlog 
as at june   our obligations included approximately million in various state sales taxes 
at june   however  we had a working capital deficit of approximately million as compared to a working capital deficit of million at june  and a stockholders deficiency of million at june  as compared to a stockholders deficiency of million at june  for the year ended june   we realized a net loss of million  which included non cash charges of approximately million 
our principal source of liquidity has been derived from revenues  as well as by cash provided by the sale of certain assets 
effective september   a wholly owned subsidiary of hmca sold its equity interest in an entity providing management services to a scanning center in bensonhurst  new york for approximately million 
in august   the company entered into a modification agreement with regard to the asset purchase agreement with health plus management services  llc the company received a  payment on the note issued by health plus 
the note was repaid in full by mountain crest ventures  of which a related party is a member 
our business plan includes an program for manufacturing and selling our upright r mri scanners 
in addition  we are enhancing our revenue by participating in the physician and diagnostic services management business through our subsidiary  hmca and have upgraded the facilities which it manages  most significantly by the replacement of existing mri scanners with new upright r mri scanners 
presently  of the mri facilities managed by hmca  are equipped with upright r mri scanners 
we have also intensified our marketing activities through the hiring of additional marketers for hmca s clients and increasing their commissions 
our business plan also calls for a continuing emphasis on providing our customers with enhanced equipment service and maintenance capabilities and delivering state of the art  innovative and high quality equipment upgrades at competitive prices 
fees for on going service and maintenance from our installed base of scanners were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  in order to reduce our net losses and demands on our cash and other liquid reserves  we instituted an aggressive program of cost cutting during and following the end of fiscal these measures included consolidating hmca s office space with fonar s office space  reductions in the size of our workforce  compensation and benefits  as well as across the board reduction of expenses 
the cost reductions were intended to enable us to withstand periods of low volumes of mri scanner sales  by keeping expenditures at levels which  if necessary  can be supported by service revenues and hmca revenues 
we are also seeking equity and debt financing and have been engaged in discussions with several possible sources 
in order to promote sales  we are continuing to focus on marketing campaigns to strengthen the demand for our products and services 
management anticipates that fonar s capital resources will improve if fonar s mri scanner products gain wider market recognition and acceptance resulting in both increased product sales and scan volumes 
if we are not successful with our marketing efforts to increase sales  we will experience a shortfall in cash  and it will be necessary to further reduce operating expenses in a manner or obtain funds through equity or debt financing in sufficient amounts to avoid the need to curtail our operations subsequent to june  current economic credit conditions have contributed to a slowing business environment 
given such liquidity and credit constraints in the markets  the business may suffer  should the credit markets not improve in the near future 
the direct impact of these conditions is not fully known 
however  there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure additional funds if needed and that if such funds were available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us 
in such case  the reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for us to generate positive cash flow to sustain our operations 
if we are unable to meet expenditures with revenues or financing then it will be necessary to reduce expenses further  or seek other sources of funds through the issuance of debt or equity financing in order to conduct operations as now conducted subsequent to fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal approximated  capitalized software costs were approximately  and capitalized patent costs were approximately  fonar has not committed to making capital expenditures in the fiscal year 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america and assume that the company will continue as a going concern 
the company has suffered recurring losses from operations  continues to generate negative cash flows from operating activities and had negative working capital at june  these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk fonar s investments in fixed rate instruments 
none of the fixed rate instruments in which we invest extend beyond june  all of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in united states dollars
