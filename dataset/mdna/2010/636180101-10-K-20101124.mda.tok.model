item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a diversified energy company and reports financial results for four business segments 
refer to item  business  for a more detailed description of each of the segments 
this item  md a  provides information concerning the critical accounting estimates of the company  changes in revenues and earnings of the company under the heading  results of operations  operating  investing and financing cash flows under the heading capital resources and liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and other matters  including a and projected funding for the company s pension and other post retirement benefits  b realizability of deferred tax assets  c disclosures and tables concerning market risk sensitive instruments  d rate and regulatory matters in the company s new york  pennsylvania and ferc regulated jurisdictions  e environmental matters  and f new authoritative accounting and financial reporting guidance 
the information in md a should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements in item of this report 
for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september   the company experienced an increase in earnings of million 
earnings from continuing operations increased million and earnings from discontinued operations increased million 
from a continuing operations perspective  the earnings increase was primarily driven by the non recurrence of an impairment charge of million million after tax recorded in the exploration and production segment during the year ended september  in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
such costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule that determines a limit  or ceiling  on the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
at december   due to significant declines in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices and using the sec full cost rules then in effect  the book value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling  resulting in the impairment charge mentioned above 
for further discussion of the ceiling test results at september  and a sensitivity analysis to changes in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices  refer to the critical accounting estimates section below 
for further discussion of the company s earnings  refer to the results of operations section below 
the company continues to focus on the development of its marcellus shale acreage in the appalachian region of its exploration and production segment 
the marcellus shale is a middle devonian age geological shale formation that is present nearly a mile or more below the surface in the appalachian region of the united states  including much of pennsylvania and southern new york 
due to the depth at which this formation is found  drilling and completion costs  including the drilling and completion of horizontal wells with hydraulic fracturing  are very expensive 
however  independent geological studies have indicated that this formation could yield natural gas reserves measured in the trillions of cubic feet 
the company controls approximately  net acres within the marcellus shale area  with a majority of the acreage held in fee  carrying no royalty and no lease expirations 
the company s reserve base has grown substantially from development in the marcellus shale 
natural gas proved developed and undeveloped reserves in the appalachian region have increased from bcf at september  to bcf at september  with this in mind  and with a natural desire to realize the value of these assets in a responsible and orderly fashion  the company has spent significant amounts of capital in this region 
for the year ended september   the company spent million towards the development of the marcellus shale 
this included paying million in march for two tracts of leasehold acreage consisting of approximately  net acres in tioga and potter counties in pennsylvania 
these tracts are geologically and geographically similar to the company s existing marcellus shale acreage in the area  and will help the company continue its developmental drilling program 
the company has engaged jefferies company to explore joint venture opportunities across its marcellus shale acreage in its exploration and production segment 
it is the company s goal to ramp up marcellus shale development faster than its current plans 
by entering into a joint venture agreement  the company expects to enhance shareholder value by shifting a significant portion of the early drilling costs to a minority interest partner while still allowing the company to continue operating across most of its acreage 
the company s position in the marcellus shale provides a competitive advantage for a potential joint venture partner as a majority of the acreage is held in fee  carrying no royalty and no lease expirations  and large  contiguous acreage blocks allow for operating and cost efficiency through multi well pad drilling 
the company will forgo any joint venture opportunities that do not enhance shareholder value when compared to its current growth plans 
coincident with the development of its marcellus shale acreage  the company s pipeline and storage segment is building pipeline gathering and transmission facilities to connect marcellus shale production with existing pipelines in the region and is pursuing the development of additional pipeline and storage capacity in order to meet anticipated demand for the large amount of marcellus shale production expected to come on line in the months and years to come 
two of the projects  the tioga county extension project and the northern access expansion project  are considered significant for empire and supply corporation 
both projects are designed to receive natural gas produced from the marcellus shale and transport it to canada and the northeast united states to meet growing demand in those areas 
during the past year  empire and supply corporation have experienced a decline in the volumes of natural gas received at the canada united states border at the niagara river to be shipped across their systems 
the historical price advantage for gas sold at the niagara import points has declined as production in the canadian producing regions has declined or been diverted to other demand areas  and as production from new shale plays has increased in the united states 
this factor has been causing shippers to seek alternative gas supplies and consequently alternative transportation routes 
empire and supply corporation have seen transportation volumes decrease as a result of this situation 
the tioga county extension project and the northern access expansion project are designed to provide an alternative gas supply source for the customers of empire and supply corporation 
these projects  which are discussed more completely in the investing cash flow section that follows  will involve significant capital expenditures 
from a capital resources perspective  the company has been able to meet its capital expenditure needs for all of the above projects by using cash from operations 
the company had million in cash and temporary cash investments at september   as shown on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
for fiscal  the company expects that it will be able to use cash on hand and cash from operations as its first means of financing capital expenditures  with short term borrowings being its next source of funding 
it is not expected that long term financing will be required to meet capital expenditure needs until the later part of fiscal or in fiscal the possibility of environmental risks associated with a well completion technology referred to as hydraulic fracturing continues to be debated 
in pennsylvania  where the company is focusing its marcellus shale development efforts  the permitting and regulatory processes seem to strike a balance between the environmental concerns associated with hydraulic fracturing and the benefits of increased natural gas production 
hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique that has been used for many years  and in the company s experience  one that the company believes has little impact to the environment 
nonetheless  the potential for increased state or federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing could impact future costs of drilling in the marcellus shale and lead to operational delays or restrictions 
there is also the risk that drilling could be prohibited on certain acreage that is prospective for the marcellus shale 
for example  new york state currently has a moratorium in place that prevents hydraulic fracturing of new horizontal wells in the marcellus shale 
however  due to the small amount of marcellus shale acreage owned by the company in new york state  the moratorium is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s plans for marcellus shale development 
please refer to the risk factors section above for further discussion 
on september   the company sold its landfill gas operations in the states of ohio  michigan  kentucky  missouri  maryland and indiana 
those operations consisted of short distance landfill gas pipeline companies engaged in the purchase  sale and transportation of landfill gas 
the company s landfill gas operations were maintained under the company s wholly owned subsidiary  horizon lfg 
this sale resulted in a million gain  net of tax 
the decision to sell was based on progressing the company s strategy of divesting its smaller  non core assets in order to focus on its core businesses  including the development of the marcellus shale and the construction of key pipeline infrastructure projects throughout the appalachian region 
as a result of the decision to sell the landfill gas operations  the company began presenting those operations as discontinued operations in september on september   the company completed the sale of its sawmill in marienville  pennsylvania  including approximately million board feet of logs and timber consisting of yard inventory along with unexpired timber cutting contracts and certain land and timber holdings designed to provide the purchaser with a supply of logs for the mill 
despite this sale  the company has retained substantially all of its land and timber holdings  along with mineral rights on land to be sold 
the company will maintain a forestry operation  however  as part of this change in focus  the company will no longer be processing lumber products 
the company received proceeds of approximately million from the sale 
in addition  the purchaser assumed approximately million in payment obligations under the company s timber cutting contracts with various timber suppliers 
in addition to the million board feet mentioned above  the company expects to sell an additional million board feet of logs to the purchaser over a five year period  during which time the company anticipates receiving up to an additional million in proceeds 
there was not a material impact to earnings from this sale 
critical accounting estimates the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those estimates whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of accounting policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to item at note a summary of significant accounting policies 
oil and gas exploration and development costs 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting methodology  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
the company does not recognize any gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center 
the company believes that determining the amount of the company s proved reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of reserves that  based on geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be producible under existing economic and operating conditions 
such estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and may be subject to substantial revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the estimates involved in determining proved reserves are critical accounting estimates because they serve as the basis over which capitalized costs are depleted under the full cost method of accounting on a units of production basis 
unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until proved reserves are found or it is determined that the unproved properties are impaired 
all costs related to unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the pool of capitalized costs being amortized 
in addition to depletion under the units of production method  proved reserves are a major component in the sec full cost ceiling test 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test  which is performed each quarter  determines a limit  or ceiling  on the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
the ceiling under this test represents a the present value of estimated future net cash flows  excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  using a discount factor of  which is computed by applying an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month oil and gas prices for each month within the twelve month period prior to the end of the reporting period as adjusted for hedging to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet  less estimated future expenditures  plus b the cost of unevaluated properties not being depleted  less c income tax effects related to the differences between the book and tax basis of the properties 
the estimates of future production and future expenditures are based on internal budgets that reflect planned production from current wells and expenditures necessary to sustain such future production 
the amount of the ceiling can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of additions to or subtractions from proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the ceiling is then compared to the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes 
if the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling at the end of any fiscal quarter  a non cash impairment must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
this non cash impairment cannot be reversed at a later date if the ceiling increases 
it should also be noted that a non cash impairment to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value in any given period causes a reduction in future depletion expense 
at september   the ceiling exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
the month average of the first day of the month price for crude oil for each month during  based on posted midway sunset prices  was per bbl 
the month average of the first day of the month price for natural gas for each month during  based on the quoted henry hub spot price for natural gas  was per mmbtu 
note because actual pricing of the company s various producing properties varies depending on their location and hedging  the actual various prices received for such production is utilized to calculate the ceiling  rather than the midway sunset and henry hub prices  which are only indicative of month average prices for if natural gas prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  had been per mmbtu lower  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
if crude oil prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  had been per bbl lower  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
if both natural gas and crude oil prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  were lower by per mmbtu and per bbl  respectively  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
these calculated amounts are based solely on price changes and do not take into account any other changes to the ceiling test calculation 
it is difficult to predict what factors could lead to future impairments under the sec s full cost ceiling test 
as discussed above  fluctuations in or subtractions from proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices have an impact on the amount of the ceiling at any point in time 
in accordance with the current authoritative guidance for asset retirement obligations  the company records an asset retirement obligation for plugging and abandonment costs associated with the exploration and production segment s crude oil and natural gas wells and capitalizes such costs in property  plant and equipment ie the full cost pool 
under the current authoritative guidance for asset retirement obligations  since plugging and abandonment costs are already included in the full cost pool  the units of production depletion calculation excludes from the depletion base any estimate of future plugging and abandonment costs that are already recorded in the full cost pool 
as discussed above  the full cost method of accounting provides a ceiling to the amount of costs that can be capitalized in the full cost pool 
in accordance with current authoritative guidance  since the full cost pool includes an amount associated with plugging and abandoning the wells  as discussed in the preceding paragraph  the calculation of the full cost ceiling no longer reduces the future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves by an estimate of plugging and abandonment costs 
regulation 
the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its utility and pipeline and storage segments  has accounting policies which conform to the fasb authoritative guidance regarding accounting for certain types of regulations  and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratesetting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then flowed through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the balance sheet and included in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as an extraordinary item 
for further discussion of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  refer to item at note c regulatory matters 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  and pipeline and storage segment  uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
these instruments are categorized as price swap agreements and futures contracts 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company accounted for these instruments as effective cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
gains or losses associated with the derivative financial instruments are matched with gains or losses resulting from the underlying physical transaction that is being hedged 
to the extent that the derivative financial instruments would ever be deemed to be ineffective based on the effectiveness testing  mark to market gains or losses from the derivative financial instruments would be recognized in the income statement without regard to an underlying physical transaction 
the company uses both exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the company adopted the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements during the quarter ended december  as such  the fair value of such derivative financial instruments is determined under the provisions of this guidance 
the fair value of exchange traded derivative financial instruments is determined from level inputs  which are quoted prices in active markets 
the company determines the fair value of non exchange traded derivative financial instruments based on an internal model  which uses both observable and unobservable inputs other than quoted prices 
these inputs are considered level or level inputs 
all derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities are evaluated for the probability of default by either the counterparty or the company 
credit reserves are applied against the fair values of such assets or liabilities 
refer to the market risk sensitive instruments section below for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements related to its pension and other post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which uses many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase and  for other post retirement benefits  the expected annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits 
the company utilizes a yield curve model to determine the discount rate 
the yield curve is a spot rate yield curve that provides a zero coupon interest rate for each year into the future 
each year s anticipated benefit payments are discounted at the associated spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
the discount rate is then determined based on the spot interest rate that results in the same present value when applied to the same anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on plan assets assumption used by the company reflects the anticipated long term rate of return on the plan s current and future assets 
the company utilizes historical investment data  projected capital market conditions  and the plan s target asset class and investment manager allocations to set the assumption regarding the expected return on plan assets 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience  including deviations between actual versus expected return on plan assets  could have a material impact on the amount of pension and post retirement benefit costs and funding requirements experienced by the company 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its utility and pipeline and storage segments in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate  as discussed above under regulation 
pension and post retirement benefit costs for the utility and pipeline and storage segments  as determined under the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits  represented of the company s total pension and post retirement benefit costs for the years ended september  and changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could also have an impact on the benefit obligation and the funded status related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits and could impact the company s equity 
for example  the discount rate was changed from in to in the change in the discount rate from to increased the retirement plan projected benefit obligation by million and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million 
other examples include actual versus expected return on plan assets  which has an impact on the funded status of the plans  and actual versus expected benefit payments  which has an impact on the pension plan projected benefit obligation and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
for  the actual return on plan assets exceeded the expected return  which improved the funded status of the retirement plan million as well as the veba trusts and h accounts million 
the actual versus expected benefit payments for caused a decrease of million to the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
in calculating the projected benefit obligation for the retirement plan and the accumulated post retirement obligation  the actuary takes into account the average remaining service life of active participants 
the average remaining service life of active participants is years for the retirement plan and years for those eligible for other post retirement benefits 
for further discussion of the company s pension and other post retirement benefits  refer to other matters in this item  which includes a discussion of funding for the current year  and to item at note h retirement plan and other post retirement benefits 
results of operations earnings compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in as previously discussed  the company sold its landfill gas operations in the states of ohio  michigan  kentucky  missouri  maryland and indiana in september accordingly  all financial results for those operations  which are part of the all other category  have been presented as discontinued operations 
the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in compared with million in the company s earnings from discontinued operations were million in compared to a loss of million in the increase in earnings from continuing operations of million is primarily the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production segment 
the utility and energy marketing segments  as well as the all other category  also contributed to the increase in earnings 
lower earnings in the pipeline and storage segment and a higher loss in the corporate category slightly offset these increases 
the increase in earnings from discontinued operations primarily resulted from the gain on the sale of the company s landfill gas operations recognized in as well as the non recurrence of million of impairment charges recognized in related to certain landfill gas assets 
in the discussion that follows  note that all amounts used in the earnings discussions are after tax amounts  unless otherwise noted 
earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations were impacted by the following event in and several events in  including event a million gain on the sale of the company s landfill gas operations  which was completed in september this amount is included in earnings from discontinued operations 
events a non cash million impairment charge million after tax recorded during the quarter ended december  for the exploration and production segment s oil and gas producing properties  a million impairment in the value of certain landfill gas assets  a million impairment in the value of the company s investment in esne recorded in the all other category  a limited liability company that owns an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in the town of north east  pennsylvania  and a million death benefit gain on life insurance policies recognized in the corporate category 
compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in compared with million in the company recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million in compared with earnings from discontinued operations of million in discontinued operations in and consisted of the company s landfill gas operations in the states of ohio  michigan  kentucky  missouri  maryland and indiana 
the decrease in earnings from continuing operations of million is primarily the result of lower earnings in the exploration and production  pipeline and storage and utility segments and the all other category  slightly offset by a lower loss in the corporate category and higher earnings in the energy marketing segment  as shown in the table below 
the loss from discontinued operations in compared to earnings from discontinued operations in reflects the recognition of million of impairment charges in related to certain landfill gas assets 
earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations were impacted by the events discussed above and the following event event a million gain in the all other category associated with the sale of horizon power s gas powered turbine

compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this decrease largely resulted from a million decrease in retail gas sales revenues  a million decrease in transportation revenues  and a million decrease in other operating revenues 
these were partially offset by a million increase in off system sales revenue 
the decrease in retail gas sales revenues of million was largely a function of warmer weather and lower gas costs subject to certain timing variations  gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues 
the recovery of lower gas costs resulted from a lower cost of purchased gas combined with the refunding of previously over recovered purchased gas costs 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the increase in off system sales revenues of million was largely due to the utility segment not engaging in off system sales from november through october this was due to order no 
final rule  which was issued by the ferc on october  the final rule seemingly held that a local distribution company making off system sales on unaffiliated pipelines would be engaging in marketing that would require distribution corporation to substantially modify its operations in order to assure compliance with the ferc s standards of conduct 
accordingly  pending clarification of this issue from the ferc  as of november   distribution corporation ceased off system sales activities 
on october   the ferc released order no 
a  which clarified that a local distribution company making off system sales of gas that has been transported on non affiliated pipelines is not subject to the ferc standards of conduct 
in light of and in reliance on this clarification  distribution corporation determined that it could resume engaging in off system sales on non affiliated pipelines 
such off system sales resumed in november due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal and there was not a material impact to earnings 
the decrease in transportation revenues of million was primarily due to warmer weather and the resulting decrease in transportation volumes for residential and commercial customers 
while there was a slight increase in transportation volumes of bcf for all revenue classes  this was largely due to an increase in throughput for large industrial customers 
margins associated with large industrial customers do not have a significant impact on transportation revenues 
the decrease in other operating revenues of million is largely due to a decrease in late payment revenue  caused by a decrease in gas costs 
compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this decrease largely resulted from a million decrease in off system sales revenue see discussion below  a million decrease in retail gas sales revenues  a million decrease in transportation revenues  and a million decrease in other operating revenues 
the decrease in retail gas sales revenues of million was largely a function of the recovery of lower gas costs subject to certain timing variations  gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues 
the recovery of lower gas costs resulted from a much lower cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the decrease in transportation revenues of million was primarily due to a bcf decrease in transportation throughput  largely the result of customer conservation efforts and the poor economy 
in the new york jurisdiction  the nypsc issued an order providing for an annual rate increase of million beginning december  as part of this rate order  a rate design change was adopted that shifts a greater amount of cost recovery into the minimum bill amount  thus spreading the recovery of such costs more evenly throughout the year 
as a result of this rate order  retail and transportation revenues for were million lower than revenues for the utility segment had off system sales revenues of million and million for and  respectively 
due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal and there was not a material impact to margins in and the decrease in off system sales revenue stemmed from order no 
final rule  as discussed above 
the decrease in other operating revenues of million is largely related to amounts recorded in pursuant to rate settlements approved by the nypsc 
in accordance with these settlements  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the cost mitigation reserve to offset certain specific expense items 
in  distribution corporation utilized million of the cost mitigation reserve  which increased other operating revenues  to recover previous undercollections of pension expenses 
in  distribution corporation utilized only million of the cost mitigation reserve 
the impact of this million decrease in other operating revenues was offset by an equal decrease to operation and maintenance expense thus there was no earnings impact 
purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs are attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
distribution corporation recorded million  million and million of purchased gas expense during  and  respectively 
under its purchased gas adjustment clauses in new york and pennsylvania  distribution corporation is not allowed to profit from fluctuations in gas costs 
purchased gas expense recorded on the consolidated income statement matches the revenues collected from customers  a component of operating revenues on the consolidated income statement 
under mechanisms approved by the nypsc in new york and the papuc in pennsylvania  any difference between actual purchased gas costs and what has been collected from the customer is deferred on the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset  unrecovered purchased gas costs  or a liability  amounts payable to customers 
these deferrals are subsequently collected from the customer or passed back to the customer  subject to review by the nypsc and the papuc 
absent disallowance of full recovery of distribution corporation s purchased gas costs  such costs do not impact the profitability of the company 
purchased gas costs impact cash flow from operations due to the timing of recovery of such costs versus the actual purchased gas costs incurred during a particular period 
distribution corporation s purchased gas adjustment clauses seek to mitigate this impact by adjusting revenues on either a quarterly or monthly basis 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation  empire and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers  and for storage service with supply corporation and two nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation satisfies a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per mcf in  a decrease of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was lower than the average cost of per mcf in additional discussion of the utility segment s gas purchases appears under the heading sources and availability of raw materials in item earnings compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in in the new york jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
the positive earnings impact associated with lower operating expenses of million primarily a decrease in bad debt expense slightly offset by an increase in personnel costs and routine regulatory adjustments million were partially offset by a million decrease in late payment revenue due to lower gas costs and higher income tax expense of million 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
for  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million  as the weather was warmer than normal 
for  the wnc reduced earnings by approximately million  as the weather was colder than normal 
in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
the positive earnings impact associated with a lower effective tax rate million and lower operating expenses of million were the main factors in the earnings increase 
the effective tax rate impact is attributable to a lower state income tax expense in as a result of the pass back to customers of over collected gas costs 
the decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in bad debt expense 
these factors were partially offset by lower usage per account million  higher interest expense million  warmer weather million and routine regulatory true up adjustments million 
the phrase usage per account refers to average gas consumption per account after factoring out any impact that weather may have had on consumption 
the increase in interest expense was partially due to the company s april debt issuance that was issued at a significantly higher interest rate than the debt that had matured in march in addition  accrued interest on deferred gas costs increased as a result of the over recovery of gas costs during fiscal compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in in the new york jurisdiction  earnings decreased by million 
this was primarily due to an increase in interest expense million stemming from the borrowing by the new york jurisdiction of distribution corporation of a portion of the company s april debt issuance 
the april debt was issued at a significantly higher interest rate than the interest rates on debt that had matured in march the negative earnings impact of the december  rate order discussed above million and routine regulatory adjustments million also contributed to the decrease 
the decrease was partially offset by a million overall reduction in operating expenses mostly other post retirement benefits and pension expense 
in  the wnc reduced earnings by approximately million  as the weather was colder than normal 
in  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million  as the weather was warmer than normal 
in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
this was primarily due to the positive earnings impact of colder weather million  routine regulatory adjustments million and lower operating expenses million 
a decrease in normalized usage per account million  a higher effective tax rate million and an increase in interest expense million partially offset these increases 
the phrase usage per account refers to the average gas consumption per customer account after factoring out any impact that weather may have had on consumption 
pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation interruptible transportation firm storage service interruptible storage service other pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation interruptible transportation operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease was due to a decrease in interruptible transportation revenues of million largely due to a decrease in the gathering rate under supply corporation s tariff 
also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in cashout revenues of million reported as a part of other revenue in the table above 
cashout revenues are completely offset by purchased gas expense and as a result have no impact on earnings 
offsetting the decrease was an increase in efficiency gas revenues of million reported as a part of other revenue in the table above due to higher efficiency gas volumes and a significantly lower efficiency gas inventory write down in versus these increases to efficiency gas revenues were partially offset by lower gas prices and a lower gain  period over period  on the sale of retained efficiency gas volumes held in inventory 
under supply corporation s tariff with shippers  supply corporation is allowed to retain a set percentage of shipper supplied gas to cover compressor fuel costs and for other operational purposes 
to the extent that supply corporation does not need all of the gas to cover such operational needs  it is allowed to keep the excess gas as inventory 
that inventory is later sold to buyers on the open market 
the excess gas that is retained as inventory  as well as any gains resulting from the sale of such inventory  represent efficiency gas revenue to supply corporation 
also offsetting the decrease in revenues was an increase in firm transportation revenues of million 
this increase was primarily the result of higher revenues from the empire connector  which was placed in service in december  partially offset by a reduction in the level of short term contracts entered into by shippers period over period as such shippers utilized lower priced pipeline transportation routes 
transportation volume decreased by bcf in as compared with these decreases were largely due to shippers seeking alternative lower priced gas supply and in some cases  not renewing short term transportation contracts combined with warmer weather and lower industrial demand 
the reason shippers are seeking lower priced gas supply is primarily because of the relatively higher price of natural gas supplies available at the united states canadian border at the niagara river near buffalo  new york compared to the lower pricing for supplies available at leidy  pennsylvania 
empire s proposed tioga county extension project and supply corporation s northern access expansion project  both of which are discussed in the investing cash flow section that follows  are designed to utilize that available pipeline capacity by receiving natural gas produced from the marcellus shale and transporting it to canada and the northeast united states where demand has been growing 
much of the impact of lower volumes is offset by the straight fixed variable rate design utilized by supply corporation and empire 
however  this rate design does not protect supply corporation or empire in situations where shippers do not contract for that capacity at the same quantity and rate 
in that situation  supply corporation or empire can propose revised rates and services in a rate case at the ferc 
compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in as compared with the increase was primarily due to a million increase in transportation revenue primarily due to higher revenues from the empire connector and new contracts for transportation service 
partially offsetting this increase  efficiency gas revenues decreased million 
the majority of this decrease was due to significantly lower gas prices in as compared to earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease in earnings is primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction million  higher operating costs million  higher property taxes million  higher interest expense million and higher depreciation expense million 
lower transportation revenues of million  as discussed above  also contributed to the earnings decrease 
the decrease in allowance for funds used during construction equity component is a result of the construction of the empire connector  which was completed and placed in service on december  the increase in operating expenses can primarily be attributed to higher pension expense  higher personnel costs  and an increase in corrosion logging expenses associated with supply corporation s storage wells 
the increase in property taxes is primarily a result of additional property taxes and higher payments in lieu of taxes associated with the empire connector 
the increase in interest expense can be attributed to higher debt balances and a higher average interest rate on borrowings combined with a decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction resulting from the completion of the empire connector 
the increase in the average interest rate stems from the company s april debt issuance 
the increase in depreciation expense is primarily the result of the empire connector being placed in service in december these earnings decreases were partially offset by the earnings impact associated with higher efficiency gas revenues million  as discussed above  and lower income tax expense million due to a lower effective tax rate 
compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease was primarily due to the earnings impact associated with a decrease in efficiency gas revenues million  as discussed above 
in addition  higher interest expense million  higher depreciation expense million  and a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction million also contributed to the decrease in earnings 
the increase in interest expense can be attributed to higher debt balances and a higher average interest rate on borrowings 
the increase in the average interest rate stems from the company s april debt issuance 
the increase in depreciation expense can be attributed primarily to a revision of accumulated depreciation combined with the increased depreciation associated with placing the empire connector in service in december the decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction was due to completion of the empire connector project in december whereas the allowance for funds used during construction related to the empire connector project was recorded throughout  it was only recorded for three months in these earnings decreases were partially offset by the earnings impact associated with higher transportation revenues million  as discussed above 
exploration and production revenues exploration and production operating revenues year ended september thousands gas after hedging oil after hedging gas processing plant other intrasegment elimination operating revenues represents the elimination of certain west coast gas production revenue included in gas after hedging in the table above that is sold to the gas processing plant shown in the table above

includes low gravity oil which generally sells for a lower price 
compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment increased million in as compared with gas production revenue after hedging increased million primarily due to production increases in the appalachian division 
the increase in appalachian natural gas production was mainly due to marcellus shale production that came on line during fiscal  primarily in tioga county  pennsylvania 
increases in natural gas production were partially offset by a per mcf decrease in the weighted average price of gas after hedging 
oil production revenue after hedging increased million due to an increase in the weighted average price of oil after hedging per bbl  while oil production levels were slightly lower in fiscal in addition  there was a million increase in gross processing plant revenues net of eliminations due to an increase in the commodity prices of residual gas and liquids sold at seneca s processing plants in the west coast region 
refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
refer to the tables above for production and price information 
compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment decreased million in as compared with gas production revenue after hedging decreased million primarily due to a per mcf decrease in weighted average prices after hedging 
gas production was virtually flat with the prior year as production decreases in the gulf coast region were substantially offset by production increases in the appalachian region 
the decrease in gas production that occurred in the gulf coast region  mmcf was a result of lingering shut ins caused by hurricanes edouard  gustav and ike in september while seneca s properties sustained only superficial damage from the hurricanes  two significant producing properties were shut in for a significant portion of the current fiscal year due to repair work on third party pipelines and onshore processing facilities 
one of the properties was back on line by march  and the other property was back on line by the end of april the increase in gas production in the appalachian region of  mmcf resulted from additional wells drilled throughout fiscal that came on line in oil production revenue after hedging decreased million due to a per barrel decrease in weighted average prices after hedging  which more than offset an increase in oil production of  barrels primarily from the west coast and gulf coast regions 
in addition  there was a million decrease in gross processing plant revenues net of eliminations due to a reduction in the commodity prices of residual gas and liquids sold at seneca s processing plants in the west coast and appalachian regions 
refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
refer to the tables above for production and price information 
earnings compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings for were million  compared with a loss of million for  an increase of million 
the increase in earnings is primarily the result of the non recurrence of an impairment charge of million during the quarter ended december   as discussed above in the overview section 
higher natural gas production and higher crude oil prices increased earnings by million and million  respectively 
higher processing plant revenues million largely due to an increase in commodity prices of residual gas and liquids sold at seneca s processing plants in the west coast region further contributed to an increase in earnings 
lower interest expense million due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding and the capitalization of interest further contributed to an increase in earnings 
in addition  lower general and administrative and other operating expenses million increased earnings 
the decrease in general and administrative and other operating expenses primarily reflects variations between actual plugging and abandonment costs incurred versus amounts previously accrued for such properties 
during  actual plugging and abandonment costs incurred were less than the liability that had been established for such properties  resulting in a gain 
the decrease in general and administrative and other operating expenses also reflects a decrease in bad debt expense 
higher personnel costs  primarily in the appalachian region  partially offset these decreases 
lower natural gas prices million and lower crude oil production million partially offset the increase in earnings 
in addition  the earnings increases noted above were partially offset by higher depletion expense million  the earnings impact associated with higher income tax expense million  higher lease operating expenses million  and lower interest income million 
the increase in depletion expense was primarily due to an increase in production and depletable base largely due to increased capital spending in the appalachian region 
the increase in income tax expense in is attributable to the loss of a domestic production activities deduction for fiscal  the non recurrence of a corporate tax benefit received in the prior year  and higher state income taxes 
lease operating expenses increased due to higher steaming costs in california  additional production properties related to the acquisition of ivanhoe energy s united states oil and gas properties in july  an increase in the costs associated with a higher number of producing properties in the appalachian region  primarily within the marcellus shale  and higher production taxes 
the reduction in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on cash investment balances 
compared with the exploration and production segment s loss for was million  compared with earnings of million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease in earnings is primarily the result of an impairment charge of million  as discussed above 
in addition  lower crude oil prices  lower natural gas prices  and lower natural gas production decreased earnings by million  million  and million  respectively  while higher crude oil production increased earnings by million 
lower interest income million and higher operating expenses million further reduced earnings 
in addition  there was a million decrease in earnings caused by a reduction in the commodity prices of residual gas and liquids sold at seneca s processing plants in the west coast and appalachian regions 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates and lower temporary cash investment balances 
the increase in operating expenses is due to an increase in bad debt expense as a result of a customer s bankruptcy filing  and higher personnel costs in the appalachian region 
these earnings decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense million  lower lease operating costs million  lower depletion expense million  and lower income tax expense million 
the decline in interest expense is primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding 
the reduction in lease operating expenses is primarily due to a reduction in steam fuel costs in the west coast region and lower production taxes in the gulf coast region 
the decrease in depletion is primarily due to a lower full cost pool balance after the impairment charge taken during the quarter ended december  energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging other energy marketing volume year ended september natural gas mmcf compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease primarily reflects a decline in gas sales revenue due to a lower average price of natural gas that was recovered through revenues  as well as a decrease in volume sold 
the decrease in volume is largely attributable to a decrease in volume sold to low margin wholesale customers as well as fewer sales transactions undertaken at the niagara pipeline delivery point to offset certain basis risks that the energy marketing segment was exposed to under certain fixed basis commodity purchase contracts for appalachian production 
such transactions had the effect of increasing revenue and volume sold with minimal impact to earnings 
compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease is primarily due to lower gas sales revenue  due to a lower average price of natural gas that was recovered through revenues 
this decline was somewhat offset by an increase in volume sold 
the increase in sales volume is largely attributable to colder weather as well as an increase in sales transactions undertaken at the niagara pipeline delivery point to offset certain basis risks that the energy marketing segment was exposed to under certain fixed basis commodity purchase contracts for appalachian production 
such transactions had the effect of increasing revenue and volume sold with minimal impact to earnings 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher margin of million combined with lower income tax expense of million 
the increase in margin was primarily driven by improved average margins per mcf  the benefit that the energy marketing segment derived from its contracts for storage capacity  and proceeds received as a member of a class of claimants in a class action litigation settlement 
higher operating costs of million slightly offset the increase in earnings 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to a june accrual for us customs merchandise processing fees that may be due for certain past gas imports from canada  largely offset by lower bad debt expense 
compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in higher margin of million combined with lower operating costs of million primarily due to a decline in bad debt expense are responsible for the increase in earnings 
these increases were partially offset by higher income tax expense of million in as compared to the increase in margin was primarily driven by lower pipeline transportation fuel costs due to lower natural gas commodity prices  an unfavorable pipeline imbalance resolution in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal  and improved average margins per mcf  partially offset by higher pipeline reservation charges related to additional storage capacity 
all other and corporate operations all other and corporate operations primarily includes the operations of highland  seneca s northeast division  midstream corporation  horizon power  former international segment activity and corporate operations 
highland and seneca s northeast division market timber from their new york and pennsylvania land holdings 
in september  the company sold its sawmill in marienville  pennsylvania along with the mill s inventory  stumpage tracts and certain land and timber acreage for approximately million 
the company recognized a gain of approximately million from this sale million net of tax 
the company continues to maintain a forestry operation  but will no longer be processing lumber products 
midstream corporation is a pennsylvania corporation formed to build  own and operate natural gas processing and pipeline gathering facilities in the appalachian region 
horizon power s activity primarily consists of equity method investments in seneca energy  model city and esne 
horizon power has a ownership interest in each of these entities 
the income from these equity method investments is reported as income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of income 
seneca energy and model city generate and sell electricity using methane gas obtained from landfills owned by outside parties 
on november   esne stopped all electricity generation operations 
the turbines and other assets will be sold and the building will be dismantled 
esne generated electricity from an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in north east  pennsylvania 
in september  the company sold its landfill gas operations in the states of ohio  michigan  kentucky  missouri  maryland and indiana for million  recognizing a gain of million million net of tax 
the company s landfill gas operations were maintained under the company s wholly owned subsidiary  horizon lfg  which owned and operated these short distance landfill gas pipeline companies 
these operations are presented in the company s financial statements as discontinued operations 
refer to item at note j discontinued operations for further details 
earnings compared with all other and corporate operations had a loss from continuing operations of million in compared with earnings from continuing operations of million in the overall decrease was due to higher interest expense of million primarily the result of higher borrowings at a higher interest rate due to the million of notes issued in april  higher income tax expense of million due to a higher effective tax rate  higher depreciation and depletion of million mostly attributable to increased depletion expense due to an increase in timber harvested from company owned lands  and higher operating expenses of million mostly attributable to an increase in midstream corporation s operating activities 
in addition  the non recurrence of a gain resulting from a death benefit on corporate owned life insurance policies held by the company of million that occurred during the quarter ended december  further reduced earnings 
the negative earnings impact associated with items mentioned above were partially offset by higher margins of million and higher interest income of million 
the increase in margins was mostly attributable to higher margins from log and lumber sales partially due to the increase in timber harvested from low cost basis  company owned lands coupled with higher revenues from midstream corporation s gathering operations 
the increase in interest income was due to higher intercompany interest collected from the company s other operating segments as a result of the allocation of the aforementioned april debt issuance 
in addition  during the quarter ended december   esne  an unconsolidated subsidiary of horizon power  recorded an impairment charge of million  which did not recur 
horizon power s share of the impairment was million million on an after tax basis 
compared with all other and corporate operations had earnings from continuing operations of million in  an increase of million compared with a loss from continuing operations of million for the increase was due to lower operating costs million  lower income tax expenses million  lower depreciation and depletion million and higher other income million 
in  the proxy contest with new mountain vantage gp  llc led to an increase in operating costs  which did not recur in in addition  a gain on life insurance policies held by the company million further increased earnings 
the reduction in depreciation and depletion expense is due to a decrease in timber harvested from company owned lands 
the increase in other income is primarily due to an increase in the value of corporate owned life insurance policies 
these earnings increases were partially offset by higher interest expense million  lower income from horizon power s investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries million  lower margins from lumber  log  and timber rights sales million and lower interest income million 
the decrease in margins from lumber  log and timber rights sales is a result of a decline in revenues due to unfavorable market conditions 
the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher borrowings at a higher interest rate mostly due to the million of notes that were issued in april 
the decrease in interest income is largely due to lower rates on cash investment balances 
in addition  during  esne  an unconsolidated subsidiary of horizon power  recorded an impairment charge of million 
horizon power s share of the impairment was million million on an after tax basis 
the impairment charge of million recorded by esne during as discussed above was driven by a significant decrease in run time for the plant given the economic downturn and the resulting decrease in demand for electric power 
also  horizon power recognized a gain on the sale of a turbine million during that did not recur in interest income interest income was million lower in as compared to lower interest rates on cash investment balances was the primary factor contributing to this decrease 
interest income was million lower in as compared to lower cash investment balances in the exploration and production segment and lower interest rates on such investments were the primary factors contributing to this decrease 
other income other income was million lower in as compared to this decrease is attributable to a million decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction  which is primarily due to the completion of the empire connector project in december in addition  a death benefit gain on corporate owned life insurance policies of million recognized during the first quarter of did not recur in other income was million higher in as compared to this increase was primarily due to a death benefit gain on corporate owned life insurance policies of million recognized during the first quarter of in addition  there was a larger year over year increase in the value of corporate owned life insurance policies million 
this increase is partially offset by a million decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction  which is primarily due to the completion of the empire connector project in december in addition  horizon power recognized a million pre tax gain on the sale of a turbine during that did not recur in interest charges although most of the variances in interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  the following is a summary on a consolidated basis interest on long term debt increased million in as compared to the increase in was primarily the result of a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding combined with higher average interest rates 
in april  the company issued million of senior  unsecured notes due in may this increase was partially offset by the repayment of million of medium term notes that matured in march in addition  during fiscal  the exploration and production segment significantly increased its capital expenditures related to unproved properties in the marcellus shale area of the appalachian region 
as a result  the company capitalized interest costs associated with capital expenditures  which decreased interest expense by million 
interest on long term debt increased million in as compared to the increase in was primarily the result of a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding combined with higher average interest rates due to the april debt issuance discussed above 
this increase was partially offset by the repayment of million of medium term notes that matured in march other interest charges decreased million in compared to the decrease is mainly attributable to a million decrease in interest expense on regulatory deferrals primarily deferred gas costs in the utility segment  which was partially offset by a million decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction resulting from the completion of the empire connector in december other interest charges increased million in compared to the increase in was primarily caused by a million increase in interest expense on regulatory deferrals primarily deferred gas costs in the utility segment s new york jurisdiction combined with a million decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction related to the empire connector project 
in addition  there was an increase due to an audit adjustment on a state tax return from million 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources and uses of cash during the last three years are summarized in the following condensed statement of cash flows sources uses of cash year ended september millions provided by operating activities capital expenditures investment in subsidiary  net of cash acquired net proceeds from sale of timber mill and related assets net proceeds from sale of landfill gas pipeline assets cash held in escrow net proceeds from sale of oil and gas producing properties other investing activities reduction of long term debt net proceeds from issuance of long term debt net proceeds from issuance of common stock dividends paid on common stock excess tax benefits associated with stock based compensation awards shares repurchased under repurchase plan net increase decrease in cash and temporary cash investments operating cash flow internally generated cash from operating activities consists of net income available for common stock  adjusted for non cash expenses  non cash income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items include depreciation  depletion and amortization  impairment of oil and gas producing properties  impairment of investment in partnership  deferred income taxes  income or loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries net of cash distributions and gain on sale of discontinued operations 
cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather may also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by the straight fixed variable rate design used by supply corporation and empire 
cash provided by operating activities in the exploration and production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments  including price swap agreements and futures contracts in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  a decrease of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the decrease is primarily due to the timing of gas cost recovery in the utility segment 
as gas prices decreased significantly during  the company s utility segment experienced an over recovery of gas costs that was reflected in amounts payable to customers on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
since september   the company has been refunding that over recovery to its customers 
from a consolidated perspective  higher interest payments on long term debt also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  an increase of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the increase is primarily due to the timing of gas cost recovery in the utility segment

the pipeline and storage capital expenditure amounts for also include million spent on the lamont project  discussed below 
the majority of the pipeline and storage segment s capital expenditures for and were related to the empire connector project  which was placed into service on december   as well as for additions  improvements  and replacements to this segment s transmission and gas storage systems 
the empire connector project was completed for a cost of approximately million 
the company capitalized empire connector project costs of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
exploration and production in  the exploration and production segment capital expenditures were primarily well drilling and completion expenditures and included approximately million for the gulf coast region  the majority of which was for the off shore program in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region including million in the marcellus shale area 
these amounts included approximately million spent to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
the capital expenditures in the appalachian region include the company s acquisition of two tracts of leasehold acreage for approximately million 
the company acquired these tracts in order to expand its marcellus shale acreage holdings 
these tracts  consisting of approximately  net acres in tioga and potter counties in pennsylvania  are geographically similar to the company s existing marcellus shale acreage in the area  and will help the company continue its developmental drilling program 
the transaction closed on march  the company funded this transaction with cash from operations 
in  the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures were primarily well drilling and completion expenditures and included approximately million for the gulf coast region  substantially all of which was for the off shore program in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
these amounts included approximately million spent to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
in july  the company s wholly owned subsidiary in the exploration and production segment  seneca  purchased ivanhoe energy s united states oil and gas operations for approximately million in cash including cash acquired of million 
the cash acquired at acquisition includes million held in escrow at september  and seneca placed this amount in escrow as part of the purchase price 
currently  the company and ivanhoe energy are negotiating a final resolution to the issue of whether ivanhoe energy is entitled to some or all of the amount held in escrow 
this purchase complements the segment s existing oil producing assets in the midway sunset field in california 
this acquisition was funded with cash on hand 
in  the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures were primarily well drilling and completion expenditures and included approximately million for the gulf coast region  substantially all of which was for the off shore program in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
these amounts included approximately million spent to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
the appalachian region capital expenditures include million for the purchase of storage facilities  buildings  and base gas from supply corporation  as shown in the table above 
all other and corporate in and  the majority of the all other category s capital expenditures for long lived assets were for the construction of midstream corporation s covington gathering system  as discussed below 
nfg midstream covington  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of midstream corporation  constructed a gathering system in tioga county  pennsylvania 
the project  called the covington gathering system  was constructed in two phases 
the first phase was completed and placed in service in november the second phase was placed in service in may the system consists of approximately miles of gathering system at a cost of million 
during the years ended september  and  midstream corporation spent million and million  respectively  related to this project 
on september   the company completed the sale of its sawmill in marienville  pennsylvania  including approximately million board feet of logs and timber consisting of yard inventory along with unexpired timber cutting contracts and certain land and timber holdings designed to provide the purchaser with a supply of logs for the mill 
despite this sale  the company has retained substantially all of its land and timber holdings  along with mineral rights on land to be sold 
the company will maintain a forestry operation  however  as part of this change in focus  the company will no longer be processing lumber products 
the company received proceeds of approximately million from the sale 
in addition  the purchaser assumed approximately million in payment obligations under the company s timber cutting contracts with various timber suppliers 
in addition to the million board feet mentioned above  the company expects to sell an additional million board feet of logs to the purchaser over a five year period  during which time the company anticipates receiving up to an additional million in proceeds 
there was not a material impact to earnings from this sale 
in  the majority of the all other and corporate category s expenditures for long lived assets were for construction of a lumber sorter for highland s sawmill operations that was placed into service in october  as well as for purchases of equipment for highland s sawmill and kiln operations 
additionally  horizon power sold a gas powered turbine in march that it had planned to use in the development of a co generation plant 
horizon power received proceeds of million and recorded a pre tax gain of million associated with the sale 
estimated capital expenditures the company s estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are year ended september millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production all other includes estimated expenditures for the years ended september   and of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
the company is committed to developing its proved undeveloped reserves within five years of being recorded as proved undeveloped reserves as required by the sec s final rule on modernization of oil and gas reporting 
exploration and production segment estimated capital expenditures do not take into account possible joint venture opportunities involving this segment s marcellus shale acreage 
the amounts could change if a joint venture is formed 
utility estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a lesser extent  the purchase of new equipment 
pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated on the replacement of transmission and storage lines  the reconditioning of storage wells  improvements of compressor stations and construction of new pipeline and compressor stations to support expansion projects 
in light of the growing demand for pipeline capacity to move natural gas from new wells being drilled in appalachia specifically in the marcellus shale producing area supply corporation and empire are actively pursuing several expansion projects and paying for preliminary survey and investigation costs  which are initially recorded as deferred charges on the consolidated balance sheet 
an offsetting reserve is established as those preliminary survey and investigation costs are incurred  which reduces the deferred charges balance and increases operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statement of income 
the company reviews all projects on a quarterly basis  and if it is determined that it is highly probable that the project will be built  the reserve is reversed 
this reversal reduces operation and maintenance expense and reestablishes the original balance in deferred charges 
after the reversal of the reserve  amounts remain in deferred charges until construction begins  at which point the balance is transferred from deferred charges to construction work in progress  a component of property  plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of september   the total amount reserved for the pipeline and storage segment s preliminary survey and investigation costs was million 
supply corporation is moving forward with several projects designed to move anticipated marcellus production gas to other interstate pipelines and to markets beyond supply corporation s pipeline system 
supply corporation has signed a precedent agreement to provide  dth day of firm transportation capacity in conjunction with its northern access expansion project 
upon satisfaction of the conditions in the precedent agreement  statoil natural gas llc will enter into a year firm transportation agreement for  dth day 
this capacity will provide the subscribing shipper with a firm transportation path from the tennessee gas pipeline tgp line at ellisburg into the transcanada pipeline at niagara 
this path is attractive because it provides a route for marcellus shale gas  principally along the tgp line in northern pennsylvania  to be transported from the marcellus supply basin to northern markets 
service is expected to begin in late  and supply corporation has begun working on an application for ferc authorization of the project  which it expects to file in the second quarter of fiscal year the project facilities involve additional compression at supply corporation s existing ellisburg station and at a new station in east aurora  new york  along with other system enhancements including the jointly owned niagara spur loop line 
the preliminary cost estimate for the northern access expansion is million 
these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   less than million has been spent to study the northern access expansion project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  one strategic horsepower expansion project involves new compression along supply corporation s line n line n expansion project  increasing that line s capacity by  dth day into texas eastern s holbrook station tetco holbrook in southwestern pennsylvania 
a precedent agreement for  dth day of firm transportation has been executed and negotiations are underway for the remaining capacity 
the project will allow marcellus production located in the vicinity of line n to flow south into texas eastern and access markets off texas eastern s system  with a projected in service date of september on october   the ferc granted supply corporation s request for a pre filing environmental review of the line n expansion project  and on june   supply corporation filed an nga section c application to the ferc for approval of the project 
the preliminary cost estimate for the line n expansion project is million  all of which is expected to be spent in fiscal and except for approximately million already spent through september  these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
the company has determined that it is highly probable that this project will be built 
accordingly  all previous reserves established in connection with this project have been reversed  and the million has been reestablished as a deferred charge on the consolidated balance sheet 
supply corporation has also executed a precedent agreement for  dth day of additional capacity on line n to tetco holbrook to be ready for service beginning november line n phase ii expansion project 
the line n phase ii expansion project will provide approximately  dth day of incremental firm transportation capacity 
marketing efforts are underway for the remaining  dth day of capacity 
the preliminary cost estimate for the line n phase ii expansion project is approximately million 
these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   less than million has been spent to study the line n phase ii expansion project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  another strategic horsepower expansion project  involving the addition of compression at supply corporation s existing interconnect with tgp at lamont  pennsylvania  has been in service since june  lamont project 
a second lamont project phase is planned lamont phase ii project 
with the construction of additional horsepower   dth day of incremental firm capacity will be available starting july  ramping up to full service by october  supply corporation has two signed precedent agreements for the full capacity of this project 
the preliminary cost estimate for the lamont phase ii project is approximately million 
these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   less than million has been spent to study the lamont phase ii project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  in addition  supply corporation continues to actively pursue its largest planned expansion  the west to east we pipeline project  which is designed to transport rockies and or locally produced natural gas supplies to the ellisburg leidy corning area 
supply corporation anticipates that the development of the we project will occur in phases 
as currently envisioned  the first two phases of we  referred to as the we overbeck to leidy project  are designed to transport at least  dth day  and involves construction of a new mile pipeline through elk  cameron  clinton  clearfield and jefferson counties to the leidy hub  from marcellus and other producing areas along over miles of supply corporation s existing pipeline system 
the we overbeck to leidy project also includes a total of approximately  horsepower of compression at two separate stations 
the project may be built in phases depending on the development of marcellus production along the corridor  with the first facilities expected to go in service in following an open season that concluded on october   supply corporation executed precedent agreements to provide  dth day of firm transportation on the we overbeck to leidy project 
supply corporation is pursuing post open season capacity requests for the remaining capacity 
on march   the ferc granted supply corporation s request for a pre filing environmental review of the we overbeck to leidy project  and supply corporation is in the process of preparing an nga section c application 
the capital cost of the we overbeck to leidy project is estimated to be million  approximately million of which is expected to be spent during the period of fiscal through these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   approximately million has been spent to study the we overbeck to leidy project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  supply corporation expects that its previously announced appalachian lateral project will complement the we overbeck to leidy project due to its strategic upstream location 
the appalachian lateral pipeline  which would be routed through several counties in central pennsylvania where producers are actively drilling and seeking market access for their newly discovered reserves  will be able to collect and transport locally produced marcellus shale gas into the we overbeck to leidy facilities 
supply corporation expects to continue marketing efforts for the appalachian lateral and all other remaining sections of we 
the timeline and projected costs associated with we sections other than we overbeck to leidy  including the appalachian lateral project  will depend on market development  and as of september   no preliminary survey and investigation charges had been spent on those projects and no capital expenditures are included as estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
supply corporation has also developed plans for new storage capacity by expansion of two of its existing storage facilities 
the expansion of the east branch and galbraith fields will provide mmdth of incremental storage capacity and approximately mdth per day of additional withdrawal deliverability 
this storage expansion project  if pursued  would require an nga section c application  which supply corporation has not yet filed 
the preliminary cost estimate for this storage expansion project is million 
these expenditures are not included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   approximately million has been spent to study this storage expansion project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  the specific timeline associated with the storage expansion will depend on market development  which at this time  due to economic conditions  does not warrant additional project development 
empire has executed precedent agreements for all  dth day of incremental firm transportation capacity in its tioga county extension project 
this project will transport marcellus production from new interconnections at the southern terminus of a mile extension of its recently completed empire connector line  in tioga county  pennsylvania 
empire s preliminary cost estimate for the tioga county extension project is approximately million  all of which is expected to be spent in fiscal and except for approximately million already spent through september  these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
this project will enable shippers to deliver their natural gas at existing empire interconnections with millennium pipeline at corning  new york  with the transcanada pipeline at the niagara river at chippawa  and with utility and power generation markets along its path  as well as to a planned new interconnection with tgp s line zone in ontario county  new york 
on january   the ferc granted empire s request for a pre filing environmental review of the tioga county extension project  and on august   empire filed an nga section c application to the ferc for approval of the project 
empire anticipates that these facilities will be placed in service on september  the company has determined that it is highly probable that this project will be built 
accordingly  all previous reserves have been reversed and the million has been reestablished as a deferred charge on the consolidated balance sheet 
empire is evaluating a second phase expansion of the tioga county extension project that could extend the empire system further into the marcellus production area in pennsylvania  and or increase the capacity by up to  dth day by late the cost of this second phase could be as much as million  most of which would be spent in fiscal and is included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
the company anticipates financing the line n expansion projects  the lamont projects  the northern access expansion project  the we overbeck to leidy project  the appalachian lateral project  and the tioga county extension projects  all of which are discussed above  with a combination of cash from operations  short term debt  and long term debt 
the company had million in cash and temporary cash investments at september   as shown on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company expects to use cash from operations as the first means of financing these projects  with short term debt providing temporary financing when needed 
the company may issue some long term debt in conjunction with these projects in the later part of fiscal or in fiscal exploration and production estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the gulf coast region  substantially all of which is for the off shore program in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
the company anticipates drilling to gross wells in the marcellus shale during estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the gulf coast region  substantially all of which is for the off shore program in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
the company anticipates drilling to gross wells in the marcellus shale during estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
the company does not expect to incur any significant capital expenditures in the gulf coast region during the company anticipates drilling to gross wells in the marcellus shale during it is anticipated that these future capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash from operations  short term debt  and long term debt 
natural gas and crude oil prices combined with production from existing wells will be a significant factor in determining how much of the capital expenditures are funded from cash from operations 
the company expects to use cash from operations as the first means of financing these expenditures  with short term debt providing temporary financing when needed 
the company may issue some long term debt in conjunction with these expenditures in the later part of fiscal or in fiscal all other and corporate estimated capital expenditures in for the all other and corporate category will primarily be for construction of anticipated gathering systems  including the construction of midstream corporation s trout run gathering system  as discussed below 
nfg midstream trout run  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of midstream corporation  is planning a gathering system in lycoming county  pennsylvania 
the project  called the trout run gathering system  is anticipated to be placed in service in the fall of the system will consist of approximately miles of gathering system at a cost of million 
these expenditures are included as all other category capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   the company has spent approximately million in costs related to this project 
the company anticipates funding the midstream corporation project with cash from operations and or short term borrowings 
given the company s cash position at september   the company expects to use cash from operations as the first means of financing these projects 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations  partnerships  and other business entities 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  natural gas storage facilities and the expansion of natural gas transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow the company did not have any outstanding short term notes payable to banks or commercial paper at september  or during the fiscal year ended september  however  the company continues to consider short term debt consisting of short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures and investments in corporations and or partnerships  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  margin calls on derivative financial instruments  exploration and development expenditures  repurchases of stock  and other working capital needs 
fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt 
as for bank loans  the company maintains a number of individual uncommitted or discretionary lines of credit with certain financial institutions for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under these lines of credit are made at competitive market rates 
these credit lines  which aggregate to million  are revocable at the option of the financial institutions and are reviewed on an annual basis 
the company anticipates that these lines of credit will continue to be renewed  or substantially replaced by similar lines 
the total amount available to be issued under the company s commercial paper program is million 
the commercial paper program is backed by a syndicated committed credit facility totaling million  which commitment extends through september  under the company s committed credit facility  the company has agreed that its debt to capitalization ratio will not exceed 
at the last day of any fiscal quarter through september  at september   the company s debt to capitalization ratio as calculated under the facility was 
the constraints specified in the committed credit facility would permit an additional billion in short term and or long term debt to be outstanding further limited by the indenture covenants discussed below before the company s debt to capitalization ratio would exceed 
if a downgrade in any of the company s credit ratings were to occur  access to the commercial paper markets might not be possible 
however  the company expects that it could borrow under its committed credit facility  uncommitted bank lines of credit or rely upon other liquidity sources  including cash provided by operations 
in addition  the company s cost of capital is directly affected by its credit ratings 
at september   the company s long term debt ratings were bbb s p  baa moody s investor service  and bbb fitch ratings service 
in march  fitch ratings service decreased the company s long term debt rating from a to bbb 
the company does not believe that this ratings action will impact its access to the commercial paper markets 
at september   the company s commercial paper ratings were a s p  p moody s investor service  and f fitch ratings service 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
each credit rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and  accordingly  each rating should be considered in the context of the applicable methodology  independently of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of the company and charge the company fees for their services 
under the company s existing indenture covenants  at september   the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of billion in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at then current market interest rates in addition to being able to issue new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
however  if the company were to experience a significant loss in the future for example  as a result of an impairment of oil and gas properties  it is possible  depending on factors including the magnitude of the loss  that these indenture covenants would restrict the company s ability to issue additional long term unsecured indebtedness for a period of up to nine calendar months  beginning with the fourth calendar month following the loss 
this would not at any time preclude the company from issuing new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s indenture pursuant to which million or of the company s long term debt as of september  was issued  contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company to perform certain obligations under other borrowing arrangements could trigger an obligation to repay the debt outstanding under the indenture 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if the company fails i to pay any scheduled principal or interest on any debt under any other indenture or agreement or ii to perform any other term in any other such indenture or agreement  and the effect of the failure causes  or would permit the holders of the debt to cause  the debt under such indenture or agreement to become due prior to its stated maturity  unless cured or waived 
the company s million committed credit facility also contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company or its significant subsidiaries to make payments under other borrowing arrangements  or the occurrence of certain events affecting those other borrowing arrangements  could trigger an obligation to repay any amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if i the company or any of its significant subsidiaries fails to make a payment when due of any principal or interest on any other indebtedness aggregating million or more or ii an event occurs that causes  or would permit the holders of any other indebtedness aggregating million or more to cause  such indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity 
as of september   the company had no debt outstanding under the committed credit facility 
the company s embedded cost of long term debt was at both september  and september  if the company were to issue long term debt today  its borrowing costs might be expected to be in the range of to depending on the maturity date 
refer to interest rate risk in this item for a more detailed breakdown of the company s embedded cost of long term debt 
current portion of long term debt at september  consists of million of medium term notes that mature in november currently  the company expects to refund these medium term notes in november with cash on hand and or short term borrowings 
in april  the company issued million of notes due in may after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  the net proceeds to the company amounted to million 
these notes were registered under the securities act of the holders of the notes may require the company to repurchase their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount in the event of both a change in control and a ratings downgrade to a rating below investment grade 
the proceeds of this debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes  including to replenish cash that was used to pay the million due at the maturity of the company s medium term notes on march  on december   the company s board of directors authorized the company to implement a share repurchase program  whereby the company could repurchase outstanding shares of common stock  up to an aggregate amount of eight million shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the company completed the repurchase of the eight million shares during for a total program cost of million of which  shares were repurchased during the year ended september  for million 
in september  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional eight million shares of the company s common stock 
under this new authorization  the company repurchased  shares for million through september  the company  however  stopped repurchasing shares after september  in light of the unsettled nature of the credit markets 
since that time  the company has increased its emphasis on marcellus shale development and pipeline expansion 
as such  the company does not anticipate repurchasing any shares in the near future 
the share repurchases mentioned above were funded with cash provided by operating activities and or through the use of the company s lines of credit 
the company may issue debt or equity securities in a public offering or a private placement from time to time 
the amounts and timing of the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities will depend on market conditions  indenture requirements  regulatory authorizations and the capital requirements of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into certain off balance sheet financing arrangements 
these financing arrangements are primarily operating leases 
the company s consolidated subsidiaries have operating leases  the majority of which are with the utility and the pipeline and storage segments  having a remaining lease commitment of approximately million 
these leases have been entered into for the use of buildings  vehicles  construction tools  meters and other items and are accounted for as operating leases 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s expected future contractual cash obligations as of september   and the twelve month periods over which they occur payments by expected maturity dates thereafter total millions long term debt  including interest expense operating lease obligations purchase obligations gas purchase contracts transportation and storage contracts other refer to note e capitalization and short term borrowings  as well as the table under interest rate risk in the market risk sensitive instruments section below  for the amounts excluding interest expense 
gas prices are variable based on the nymex prices adjusted for basis 
the company has other long term obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above 
such long term obligations include pension and other post retirement liabilities  asset retirement obligations  deferred income tax liabilities  various regulatory liabilities  derivative financial instrument liabilities and other deferred credits the majority of which consist of liabilities for non qualified benefit plans  deferred compensation liabilities  environmental liabilities  workers compensation liabilities and liabilities for income tax uncertainties 
the company has made certain other guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries 
the guarantees relate primarily to i obligations under derivative financial instruments  which are included on the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with the authoritative guidance see item  md a under the heading critical accounting estimates accounting for derivative financial instruments  ii nfr obligations to purchase gas or to purchase gas transportation storage services where the amounts due on those obligations each month are included on the consolidated balance sheets as a current liability  and iii other obligations which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company believes that the likelihood it would be required to make payments under the guarantees is remote  and therefore has not included them in the table above 
other matters in addition to the environmental and other matters discussed in this item and in item at note i commitments and contingencies  the company is involved in other litigation and regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business 
these other matters may include  for example  negligence claims and tax  regulatory or other governmental audits  inspections  investigations or other proceedings 
these matters may involve state and federal taxes  safety  compliance with regulations  rate base  cost of service and purchased gas cost issues  among other things 
while these normal course matters could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the period in which they are resolved  they are not expected to change materially the company s present liquidity position  nor are they expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
the company has a tax qualified  noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan retirement plan that covers a majority of the company s employees 
the company has been making contributions to the retirement plan over the last several years and anticipates that it will continue making contributions to the retirement plan 
during  the company contributed million to the retirement plan 
the company anticipates that the annual contribution to the retirement plan in will be in the range of million to million 
changes in the discount rate  other actuarial assumptions  and asset performance could ultimately cause the company to fund larger amounts to the retirement plan in in order to be in compliance with the pension protection act of the company expects that all subsidiaries having employees covered by the retirement plan will make contributions to the retirement plan 
the funding of such contributions will come from amounts collected in rates in the utility and pipeline and storage segments or through short term borrowings or through cash from operations 
the company provides health care and life insurance benefits other post retirement benefits for a majority of its retired employees 
the company has established veba trusts and h accounts for its other post retirement benefits 
the company has been making contributions to its veba trusts and h accounts over the last several years and anticipates that it will continue making contributions to the veba trusts and h accounts 
during  the company contributed million to its veba trusts and h accounts 
the company anticipates that the annual contribution to its veba trusts and h accounts in will be in the range of million to million 
the funding of such contributions will come from amounts collected in rates in the utility and pipeline and storage segments 
as of september   the company has a federal net operating loss carryover of million  which expires in varying amounts between and although this loss carryover is subject to certain annual limitations  no valuation allowance was recorded because of management s determination that the amount will be fully utilized during the carryforward period 
market risk sensitive instruments energy commodity price risk the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment and pipeline and storage segment  uses various derivative financial instruments derivatives  including price swap agreements and futures contracts  as part of the company s overall energy commodity price risk management strategy 
under this strategy  the company manages a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil  thereby attempting to provide more stability to operating results 
the company has operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies 
the derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
the fair value of these derivatives  as shown below  represents the amount that the company would receive from  or pay to  the respective counterparties at september  to terminate the derivatives 
however  the tables below and the fair value that is disclosed do not consider the physical side of the natural gas and crude oil transactions that are related to the financial instruments 
on july   the wall street reform and consumer protection act hr was signed into law 
the law includes provisions related to the swaps and over the counter derivatives markets 
a variety of rules must be adopted by federal agencies including the commodity futures trading commission  sec and the ferc to implement the law 
these rules  which will be implemented over time frames as determined in the law  could have a significant impact on the company that was not clearly defined in the law itself 
under the law  the company expects to be exempt from mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements for most or all of its commodity hedges 
capital and margin requirements for these hedges are expected to be determined as regulators write more detailed rules and requirements 
while the company is currently reviewing the provisions of hr  it will not be able to determine the impact to its financial condition until the final rules are issued 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements  the company has identified certain inputs used to recognize fair value as level unobservable inputs 
the level derivative net liabilities relate to oil swap agreements used to hedge forecasted sales at a specific location southern california 
the company s internal model that is used to calculate fair value applies a historical basis differential between the sales locations and nymex to a forward nymex curve because there is not a forward curve specific to this sales location 
given the high level of historical correlation between nymex prices and prices at this sales location  the company does not believe that the fair value recorded by the company would be significantly different from what it expects to receive upon settlement 
the level net liabilities amount to million at september  and represent of the total net assets shown in item at note f fair value measurements at september  the company uses the crude oil swaps classified as level to hedge against the risk of declining commodity prices and not as speculative investments 
gains or losses related to these level derivative net liabilities including any reduction for credit risk are deferred until the hedged commodity transaction occurs in accordance with the provisions of the existing guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the decrease in the net fair value of the level positions from a net asset position at october  to a net liability position at september   as shown in item at note f  was attributable to an increase in the commodity price of crude oil relative to the swap price during that period 
the company believes that these fair values reasonably represent the amounts that the company would realize upon settlement based on commodity prices that were present at september  the fair value of all of the company s net derivative assets was reduced by million based upon the company s assessment of counterparty credit risk for the company s derivative assets and the company s credit risk for the company s derivative liabilities 
the company applied default probabilities to the anticipated cash flows that it was expecting to receive and pay to its counterparties to calculate the credit reserve 
the following tables disclose natural gas and crude oil price swap information by expected maturity dates for agreements in which the company receives a fixed price in exchange for paying a variable price as quoted in various national natural gas publications or on the nymex 
notional amounts quantities are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
the weighted average variable prices represent the weighted average settlement prices by expected maturity date as of september  at september   the company had not entered into any natural gas or crude oil price swap agreements extending beyond natural gas price swap agreements expected maturity dates total notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average fixed rate per mcf weighted average variable rate per mcf of the total bcf above  bcf is accounted for as fair value hedges at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
the remaining bcf are accounted for as cash flow hedges at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
crude oil price swap agreements expected maturity dates total notional quantities equivalent bbls weighted average fixed rate per bbl weighted average variable rate per bbl at september   the company would have received from its respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the natural gas price swap agreements outstanding at that date 
the company would have to pay its respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the crude oil price swap agreements outstanding at september  at september   the company had natural gas price swap agreements covering bcf at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
the company also had crude oil price swap agreements covering  bbls at a weighted average fixed rate of per bbl 
the following table discloses the net contract volume purchased sold  weighted average contract prices and weighted average settlement prices by expected maturity date for futures contracts used to manage natural gas price risk 
at september   the company held no futures contracts with maturity dates extending beyond futures contracts expected maturity dates total net contract volume purchased sold equivalent bcf weighted average contract price per mcf weighted average settlement price per mcf the energy marketing segment has purchased futures contracts contract  dth for at september   the company had long purchased futures contracts covering bcf of gas extending through at a weighted average contract price of per mcf and a weighted average settlement price of per mcf 
of this amount  bcf is accounted for as fair value hedges and are used by the company s energy marketing segment to hedge against rising prices  a risk to which this segment is exposed to due to the fixed price gas sales commitments that it enters into with certain residential  commercial  industrial  public authority and wholesale customers 
the remaining bcf is accounted for as cash flow hedges used to hedge against rising prices related to anticipated gas purchases for potential injections into storage 
the company would have had to pay million to terminate these futures contracts at september  at september   the company had short sold futures contracts covering bcf of gas extending through at a weighted average contract price of per mcf and a weighted average settlement price of per mcf 
of this amount  bcf is accounted for as cash flow hedges as these contracts relate to the anticipated sale of natural gas by the energy marketing segment 
the remaining bcf is accounted for as fair value hedges used to hedge against falling prices  a risk to which the energy marketing segment is exposed to due to the fixed price gas purchase commitments that it enters into with its natural gas suppliers 
the company would have received million to terminate these futures contracts at september  at september   the company had long purchased futures contracts covering bcf of gas extending through at a weighted average contract price of per mcf and a weighted average settlement price of per mcf 
at september   the company had short sold futures contracts covering bcf of gas extending through at a weighted average contract price of per mcf and a weighted average settlement price of per mcf 
of this amount  bcf is accounted for as cash flow hedges as these contracts relate to the anticipated sale of natural gas by the energy marketing segment 
the remaining bcf is accounted for as fair value hedges used to hedge against falling prices 
the company may be exposed to credit risk on any of the derivative financial instruments that are in a gain position 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
to mitigate such credit risk  management performs a credit check  and then on a quarterly basis monitors counterparty credit exposure 
the majority of the company s counterparties are financial institutions and energy traders 
the company has over the counter swap positions with eleven counterparties of which ten of the eleven counterparties are in a net gain position 
on average  the company had million of credit exposure per counterparty in a gain position at september  the maximum credit exposure per counterparty at september  was million 
bp energy company an affiliate of bp corporation north america  inc was one of the ten counterparties in a gain position 
at september   the company had an million receivable with bp energy company 
the company considered the credit quality of bp energy company as it does with all of its counterparties in determining hedge effectiveness and believes the hedges remain effective 
the company had not received any collateral from these counterparties at september  since the company s gain position on such derivative financial instruments had not exceeded the established thresholds at which the counterparties would be required to post collateral 
as of september   nine of the eleven counterparties to the company s outstanding derivative instrument contracts specifically the over the counter swaps had a common credit risk related contingency feature 
in the event the company s credit rating increases or falls below a certain threshold the lower of the s p or moody s debt rating  the available credit extended to the company would either increase or decrease 
a decline in the company s credit rating  in and of itself  would not cause the company to be required to increase the level of its hedging collateral deposits in the form of cash deposits  letters of credit or treasury debt instruments 
if the company s outstanding derivative instrument contracts were in a liability position and the company s credit rating declined  then additional hedging collateral deposits would be required 
at september   the fair market value of the derivative financial instrument assets with a credit risk related contingency feature was million according to the company s internal model discussed in item at note f fair value measurements 
at september   the fair market value of the derivative financial instrument liability with a credit risk related contingency feature was million according to the company s internal model discussed in item at note f fair value measurements 
for its over the counter crude oil swap agreements  which are in a liability position  the company was required to post million in hedging collateral deposits at september  this is discussed in item at note a under hedging collateral deposits 
for its exchange traded futures contracts which are in a liability position  the company had posted million in hedging collateral as of september  as these are exchange traded futures contracts  there are no specific credit risk related contingency features 
the company posts hedging collateral based on open positions and margin requirements it has with its counterparties 
the company s requirement to post hedging collateral deposits is based on the fair value determined by the company s counterparties  which may differ from the company s assessment of fair value 
hedging collateral deposits may also include closed derivative positions in which the broker has not cleared the cash from the account to offset the derivative liability 
the company records liabilities related to closed derivative positions in other accruals and current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
these liabilities are relieved when the broker clears the cash from the hedging collateral deposit account 
this is discussed in item at note a under hedging collateral deposits 
interest rate risk the following table presents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for the company s long term fixed rate debt as well as the other long term debt of certain of the company s subsidiaries principal amounts by expected maturity dates thereafter total dollars in millions long term fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate paid fair value of long term fixed rate debt  rate and regulatory matters utility operation delivery rates for both the new york and pennsylvania divisions are regulated by the states respective public utility commissions and are changed only when approved through a procedure known as a rate case 
currently neither division has a rate case on file 
in both jurisdictions  delivery rates do not reflect the recovery of purchased gas costs 
prudently incurred gas costs are recovered through operation of automatic adjustment clauses  and are collected through a separately stated supply charge on the customer bill 
new york jurisdiction customer delivery rates charged by distribution corporation s new york division were established in a rate order issued on december  by the nypsc 
the rate order approved a revenue increase of million annually  together with a surcharge that would collect up to million to cover expenses for implementation of an efficiency and conservation incentive program 
the rate order further provided for a return on equity of 
in connection with the efficiency and conservation program  the rate order approved a revenue decoupling mechanism 
the revenue decoupling mechanism decouples revenues from throughput by enabling the company to collect from small volume customers its allowed margin on average weather normalized usage per customer 
the effect of the revenue decoupling mechanism is to render the company financially indifferent to throughput decreases resulting from conservation 
the company surcharges or credits any difference from the average weather normalized usage per customer account 
the surcharge or credit is calculated to recover total margin for the most recent twelve month period ending december  and is applied to customer bills annually  beginning march st 
on april   distribution corporation filed an appeal with supreme court  albany county  seeking review of the rate order 
the appeal contended that portions of the rate order were invalid because they failed to meet the applicable legal standard for agency decisions 
among the issues challenged by the company was the reasonableness of the nypsc s disallowance of expense items and the methodology used for calculating rate of return  which the appeal contended understated the company s cost of equity 
because of the issues appealed  the case was later transferred to the appellate division  new york state s second highest court 
on december   the appellate division issued its opinion and judgment 
the court upheld the nypsc s determination relating to the authorized rate of return but also supported the company s argument that the nypsc improperly disallowed recovery of certain environmental clean up costs 
on february   the nypsc filed a motion with the court of appeals  new york state s highest court  seeking permission to appeal the appellate division s annulment of that part of the rate order relating to disallowance of environmental clean up costs 
on may   the nypsc s motion was granted  and the matter will be heard by the court of appeals

environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
the company has established procedures for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and comply with regulatory policies and procedures 
it is the company s policy to accrue estimated environmental clean up costs investigation and remediation when such amounts can reasonably be estimated and it is probable that the company will be required to incur such costs 
at september   the company has estimated its remaining clean up costs related to former manufactured gas plant sites and third party waste disposal sites will be in the range of million to million 
the minimum estimated liability of million has been recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at september  the company expects to recover its environmental clean up costs through rate recovery 
other than as discussed in note i referred to below  the company is currently not aware of any material additional exposure to environmental liabilities 
however  changes in environmental regulations  new information or other factors could adversely impact the company 
for further discussion refer to item at note i commitments and contingencies under the heading environmental matters 
legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
the epa has determined that stationary sources of significant greenhouse gas emissions will be required under the federal clean air act to obtain permits covering such emissions beginning in january in addition  the us congress has been considering bills that would establish a cap and trade program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and or purchase emission allowances 
climate change and greenhouse gas measures could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities  or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements 
but legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas  because substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated are associated with the use of natural gas than with certain alternate fuels such as coal and oil 
the effect material or not on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted 
new authoritative accounting and financial reporting guidance in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
this guidance serves to clarify the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings 
this guidance is to be applied whenever assets or liabilities are to be measured at fair value 
on october   the company adopted this guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
the fasb s authoritative guidance for using fair value to measure nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on a nonrecurring basis became effective during the quarter ended december  the company s nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities were not significantly impacted by this guidance during the year ended september  the company had identified goodwill as being the major nonfinancial asset that may have been impacted by the adoption of this guidance  however  the adoption of the guidance did not have a significant impact on the company s annual test for goodwill impairment 
the company had identified asset retirement obligations as a nonfinancial liability that may have been impacted by the adoption of the guidance 
the adoption of the guidance did not have a significant impact on the company s asset retirement obligations 
refer to item at note b asset retirement obligations for further disclosure 
additionally  in february  the fasb issued updated guidance that includes additional requirements and disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
the guidance now requires the gross presentation of activity within the level roll forward and requires disclosure of details on transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements 
it also provides further clarification on the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and disclosures on inputs and valuation techniques 
the company has updated its disclosures to reflect the new requirements in item at note f fair value measurements  except for the level roll forward gross presentation  which will be effective as of the company s first quarter of fiscal on december   the sec issued a final rule on modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the final rule modifies the sec s reporting and disclosure rules for oil and gas reserves and aligns the full cost accounting rules with the revised disclosures 
the most notable changes of the final rule include the replacement of the single day period end pricing used to value oil and gas reserves with an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month oil and gas prices for each month within the twelve month period prior to the end of the reporting period 
the final rule also permits voluntary disclosure of probable and possible reserves  a disclosure previously prohibited by sec rules 
additionally  on january   the fasb amended the oil and gas accounting standards to conform to the sec final rule on modernization of oil and gas reporting final rule 
the revised reporting and disclosure requirements became effective with this form k for the period ended september  the company has updated its disclosures to reflect the new requirements in item at note q supplementary information for oil and gas producing activities 
the company chose not to disclose probable and possible reserves 
in order to estimate the effect of adopting the final rule  the company would be required to prepare two sets of reserve reports applying both the final rule and previous rules 
there would be significant time and expense associated with preparing two sets of reports to address changes between the different rules 
since the information obtained from the dual reserve reports would be relevant only for transitional purposes  the cost is deemed to exceed the benefit 
as a result  the company has determined it would be impractical to estimate the impact of adoption of the final rule 
in march  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that expands the disclosures required in an employer s financial statements about pension and other post retirement benefit plan assets 
the additional disclosures include more details on how investment allocation decisions are made  the plan s investment policies and strategies  the major categories of plan assets  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period  and disclosure regarding significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
the additional disclosure requirements became effective with this form k for the period ended september  the company has updated its disclosures to reflect the new requirements in item at note h retirement plan and other post retirement benefits 
in june  the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance to improve and clarify financial reporting requirements by companies involved with variable interest entities 
the new guidance requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether the company s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the analysis also assists in identifying the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
this authoritative guidance will be effective as of the company s first quarter of fiscal given the current organizational structure of the company  the company does not believe this authoritative guidance will have any impact on its consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation although the rate of inflation has been relatively low over the past few years  the company s operations remain sensitive to increases in the rate of inflation because of its capital spending and the regulated nature of a significant portion of its business
