utility operations idaho power s service territory covers approximately  square miles in southern idaho and eastern oregon  with an estimated population of one million 
idaho power holds franchises in cities in idaho and nine cities in oregon and holds certificates from the respective public utility regulatory authorities to serve all or a portion of counties in idaho and three counties in oregon 
as of december   idaho power supplied electric energy to approximately  general business customers 
idaho power s principal commercial and industrial customers are involved in food processing  electronics and general manufacturing  forest products  beet sugar refining and winter recreation 
weather  customer demand and economic conditions impact electricity sales 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales 
increased precipitation levels during the agricultural growing season reduce electricity sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps 
rates and revenues retail electric utilities have historically been recognized as natural monopolies and have operated in a highly regulated environment in which they have an obligation to provide electric service to their customers in return for an exclusive franchise within their service territory with an opportunity to earn a regulated rate of return 
idaho power is under the retail jurisdiction as to rates  service  accounting and other general matters of utility operation of the idaho public utilities commission ipuc and the oregon public utility commission opuc and as a regulated electric utility  idaho power is generally not subject to retail competition 
the ipuc and the opuc determine the rates that idaho power charges to its general business customers 
idaho power is also under the retail regulatory jurisdiction of the ipuc  the opuc and the public service commission of wyoming as to the issuance of debt and equity securities 
approximately percent of idaho power s general business revenue comes from customers located in idaho 
idaho power uses general rate cases  power cost adjustment mechanisms  a fixed cost adjustment fca mechanism  and subject specific filings to recover its costs of providing service and to earn a return on investment 
significant rate cases and proceedings are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
special customer electric service agreements micron the ipuc authorized idaho power to amend temporarily an electric service agreement with one of its largest customers  micron technology  inc micron for the period january through june  to provide micron flexibility in restructuring its operations 
subsequently  the ipuc approved an extension of the temporary amendment through december  the amendments did not have a significant impact on idaho power s earnings and are not expected to have a significant impact on earnings 
the ipuc approved a replacement agreement between idaho power and micron on february   providing operating and planning benefits to idaho power while allowing micron to reduce its contract demand from mw to mw 
hoku in september  idaho power entered into an electric service agreement with a new customer  hoku materials  inc hoku  to provide electric service to hoku s polysilicon production facility under construction in pocatello  idaho 
the ipuc approved the electric service agreement in march the initial term of the agreement was four years beginning june   this date was subsequently changed to december  with a maximum demand obligation during the initial term of mw 
hoku was still not taking service on december   and idaho power agreed to temporarily waive the minimum billed energy charge in the hoku special contract  effective december  the temporary waiver would remain in effect until the month the contract load factor first exceeds percent of the total contract demand  or march   whichever comes first 
the ipuc has approved this waiver 
while the multi month delay in the starting date for hoku s required energy purchases reduces idaho power s revenues  the revenue reductions are largely offset by corresponding reductions in idaho power s costs of providing service to hoku 
wholesale as a public utility under part ii of the federal power act fpa  idaho power has authority to charge market based rates for wholesale energy sales under its ferc tariff and to provide transmission services under its open access transmission tariff oatt 
idaho power s oatt is revised each year based on financial and operational data idaho power files annually with the ferc in its form the energy policy act of energy act granted the ferc increased statutory authority to implement mandatory transmission and reliability standards  as well as enhanced oversight of power and transmission markets  including protection against market manipulation 
significant rate cases and proceedings are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
idaho power has one firm wholesale power sales contract with raft river electric cooperative for up to mw 
this contract expires in september however  raft river electric cooperative has provided notice that is intends to renew the contract  as allowed in the original agreement  through september idaho power has one wholesale reserve sales contract  with united materials of great falls  inc the agreement requires idaho power to carry reserves in association with an energy sales agreement between idaho power and united materials from the horseshoe bend wind farm located in montana 
the term of the agreement runs seasonally through may energy sales the following table presents idaho power s revenues and energy use by customer type for the last three years 
idaho power s operations are discussed further in part ii  item md a results of operations utility operations years ended december  revenues thousands of dollars residential commercial industrial irrigation deferred revenue related to hells canyon relicensing afudc total general business off system sales other total energy use thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total general business off system sales total power supply idaho power primarily relies on company owned hydroelectric  coal and gas fired generation facilities and long term power purchase agreements ppas to supply the energy needed to serve customers 
idaho power s annual hydroelectric generation varies depending on water conditions in the snake river and market purchases and sales are used to balance supply and demand throughout the year 
idaho power s low cost hydroelectric plants are typically the company s largest source of electricity 
idaho power s generating plants and their capacities are listed in item properties 
weather  customer growth and economic conditions impact power supply costs 
drought conditions and customer growth cause a greater reliance on more expensive purchased power to meet load requirements 
conversely  favorable hydroelectric generation conditions increase production at idaho power s hydroelectric generating facilities and reduce the need for purchased power 
economic conditions can affect market price of natural gas and coal  which may impact fuel expense and market prices for purchased power 
idaho power s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
the all time system peak demand is  mw  set on june   and the all time winter peak demand is  mw set on december  during these and other similar heavy load periods idaho power s system is fully committed to serve loads and meet required operating reserves 
the following table presents idaho power s total power supply for the last three years mwh percent of total generation thousands of mwhs hydroelectric plants coal fired plants natural gas fired plants total system generation purchased power cogeneration and small power production cspp purchased power other total purchased power total power supply hydroelectric generation idaho power operates hydroelectric projects located on the snake river and its tributaries 
together  these hydroelectric facilities provide a total nameplate capacity of  mw and annual generation equal to approximately million mwh under median water conditions 
because of its reliance on hydroelectric generation  idaho power s generation operations can be significantly affected by water conditions 
the availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of idaho power s hydroelectric facilities  reservoir storage  springtime snow pack run off  river base flows  spring flows  rainfall  amount and timing of water leases  and other weather and stream flow management considerations 
during low water years  when stream flows into idaho power s hydroelectric projects are reduced  idaho power s hydroelectric generation is reduced 
this results in less generation from idaho power s resource portfolio hydroelectric  coal fired and gas fired available for off system sales and  generally  an increased use of purchased power to meet load requirements 
both of these situations a reduction in off system sales and an increased use of more expensive purchased power result in increased power supply costs 
stream flow conditions improved in resulting in an increase of million mwh generated from idaho power s hydroelectric facilities as compared to the observed stream flow data released in august by the us army corps of engineers  indicated that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july was million acre feet maf  or percent of the national weather service northwest river forecast center nwrfc average  compared to maf  or percent of the nwrfc average  in storage in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee as of february   was percent of average 
the stream flow forecast released on february   by the nwrfc predicts that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july will be maf  or percent of the nwrfc average 
power generation at the idaho power hydroelectric power plants on the snake river also depends on the state water rights held by idaho power and the long term sustainability of the snake river  tributary spring flows and the eastern snake plain aquifer that is connected to the snake river 
idaho power continues to participate in water management issues in idaho that may affect those water rights and resources with the goal to preserve  to the fullest extent possible  the long term availability of water for use at idaho power s hydroelectric projects on the snake river 
for further information see part ii  item md a legal matters snake river basin water rights 
idaho power is subject to the provisions of the federal power act fpa as a public utility and as a licensee as therein defined and is subject to regulation by the ferc 
as a licensee under part i of the fpa  idaho power and its licensed hydroelectric projects are subject to conditions set forth in the fpa and related ferc regulations 
these conditions and regulations include provisions relating to condemnation of a project upon payment of just compensation  amortization of project investment from excess project earnings  possible takeover of a project after expiration of its license upon payment of net investment  severance damages and other matters 
idaho power obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc  similar to other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways 
these licenses last for to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
idaho power is actively pursuing the relicensing of the hells canyon complex and swan falls projects 
for further information on relicensing activities see part ii  item md a relicensing of hydroelectric projects 
the state of oregon has a hydroelectric act providing for licensing of hydroelectric projects in that state 
with respect to project property located in oregon  idaho power s brownlee  oxbow and hells canyon facilities are subject to the oregon hydroelectric act 
idaho power has obtained oregon licenses for these facilities and these licenses are not in conflict with the fpa or idaho power s ferc licenses 
coal and natural gas combustion generation idaho power co owns three coal fired power plants and owns two natural gas combustion turbine power plants 
the coal fired plants are jim bridger located in wyoming  boardman located in oregon  and valmy located in nevada 
the natural gas fired plants  danskin and bennett mountain  are located in idaho 
fuel supply coal idaho power  through its subsidiary ierco  owns a one third interest in bridger coal  which owns the jim bridger mine that supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant one third owned by idaho power 
the mine  located near the jim bridger plant  operates under a long term sales agreement that provides for delivery of coal over a year period ending in from surface  high wall  and underground sources 
the jim bridger mine has sufficient reserves to provide coal deliveries for the term of the sales agreement 
idaho power also has a coal supply contract providing for annual deliveries of coal through from the black butte coal company s black butte and leucite hills mines located near the jim bridger plant 
this contract supplements the bridger coal deliveries and provides another coal supply to operate the jim bridger plant 
the jim bridger plant s rail load in facility and unit coal train allow the plant to take advantage of potentially lower cost coal from other mines for tonnage requirements above established contract minimums 
nv energy  as operator of the valmy generating plant  has an agreement with arch coal sales company  inc to supply coal to the plant through as a percent owner of the plant  idaho power is obligated to purchase one half of the coal  idaho power s portion ranging from  tons to  tons annually 
nv energy also has a coal supply contract with black butte coal company s black butte mine for deliveries through idaho power is obligated to purchase one half of the coal purchased under this agreement ranging from as low as  to as many as  tons annually 
the boardman generating plant receives coal from the powder river basin through annual contracts 
portland general electric  as operator of the boardman plant  has two agreements with foundation coal west  inc to supply all of boardman s coal requirements in and additional deliveries through as a ten percent owner of the plant  idaho power is obligated to purchase ten percent of the coal purchased under these agreements  which cumulatively ranges from  to  tons annually 
fuel supply natural gas idaho power owns and operates the danskin and bennett mountain combustion turbines  which are supplied gas through northwest pipeline gp s northwest pipeline 
gas is purchased as needs are identified for summer peaks or to meet system requirements 
natural gas is transported under two long term agreements with northwest 
the first agreement  which runs into  with annual extensions at idaho power s sole discretion  is for  million british thermal units mmbtu per day 
idaho power also has the ability to flow a total of  mmbtu on an alternate firm basis without incurring a reservation charge on the additional amount 
the second agreement  beginning in and running through  provides idaho power with transportation capacity for  mmbtu per day 
in addition to the two long term gas transportation agreements  idaho power has entered into a long term storage agreement with northwest for  mmbtu of total storage capacity at the jackson prairie storage project located in lewis county  washington 
as the project is developed  storage capacity will be phased into service and allocated to idaho power on a monthly basis 
idaho power s current storage allotment is approximately percent of its total  and its full allotment is expected to be reached by january the firm storage contract expires in  with bilateral termination rights at the end of the contract 
storage gas will be purchased and stored with the intent of fulfilling needs as identified for summer peaks or to meet system requirements 
idaho power plans to construct and operate the langley gulch combined cycle natural gas power plant 
construction is scheduled to begin during the summer of with an on line date targeted for the summer of gas for langley gulch will be supplied through northwest s pipeline 
procurement of gas will be managed to meet system requirements and fueling strategies 
purchased power agreements idaho power has four firm wholesale purchased power contracts 
the first contract is with ppl energy plus  llc  for mw per hour during heavy load hours  to address increased demand during june  july and august 
the contract term is through august the second contract is with raft river energy i  llc for mw nameplate generation from its raft river geothermal power plant unit located in southern idaho 
the contract term is through april the third contract is with telocaset wind power partners  llc  for mw nameplate generation from its elkhorn valley wind project located in eastern oregon 
the contract term is through a fourth contract is currently before the ipuc for authorization 
this contract is with usg oregon llc for mw estimated average annual output from its to be constructed neal hot springs geothermal power plant located near vale  oregon 
the contract term is years with an option to extend 
commercial operation is expected in late idaho power has an exchange agreement with clatskanie people s utility 
the agreement is for the exchange of up to mws of energy from the arrowrock project in southern idaho for energy from idaho power s system or power purchased at the mid columbia trading hub 
the initial term of the agreement is january   through december  idaho power has the right to renew the agreement for two additional five year terms 
idaho power also has an exchange agreement with nv energy that is pending approval from the public utilities commission of nevada 
the term of the agreement is one business day following the public utilities commission of nevada s approval  and continuing for two consecutive years  and provides for the exchange of up to mw of energy hourly 
cspp purchases pursuant to the requirements of section of purpa  the state regulatory commissions have each issued orders and rules regulating idaho power s purchase of power from cogeneration and small power production cspp facilities 
a key component of the purpa contracts is the energy price contained within the agreements 
the purpa regulations specify that a utility must pay energy prices based on the utility s avoided costs 
the published avoided cost is a price established by the ipuc and opuc to estimate idaho power s cost of developing additional generation resources 
the ipuc and opuc have established specific rules and regulations to calculate the published avoided cost that idaho power is required to include in the purpa contracts 
idaho power has contracts for the purchase of energy from a number of private developers 
under these contracts idaho power is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside its service territory 
idaho power is required to purchase the output of projects located outside its service territory if it has the ability to receive at the facility s requested point of delivery on the idaho power system 
the ipuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts is fully recovered through base rates and the pca  the opuc jurisdictional portion is recovered through general rate case filings and the oregon power cost mechanism 
for ipuc jurisdictional contracts  projects that generate up to ten average mw of energy monthly are eligible for ipuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
for opuc jurisdictional contracts  projects with a nameplate rating of up to ten mw of capacity are eligible for opuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
if a purpa project does not qualify for published avoided costs  idaho power is required to negotiate the terms  prices and conditions with the developer 
these negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individual projects ie  operational flexibility  location and size and the benefits to the idaho power system and must be consistent with other similar energy alternatives 
on march   the ipuc increased the published avoided cost rates 
for example  the rate for a year levelized contract increased from mwh to mwh 
this increase continues a favorable climate for purpa project development and may lead to additional purpa agreements 
those agreements may result in idaho power acquiring energy at above wholesale market prices and at times when a surplus already exists as well as requiring additional operational integration costs  thus increasing costs to its customers 
as noted above  substantially all cspp costs are recovered through base rates and idaho power s power supply cost mechanisms 
as of december   idaho power had signed agreements to purchase energy from cspp facilities with contracts originally ranging from one to years 
eighty of these facilities  with a combined nameplate capacity of mw  were on line at the end of  the other facilities under contract  with a combined nameplate capacity of mw  are projected to come on line during and the majority of the new facilities will be wind resources which will generate on an intermittent basis 
during  idaho power purchased  megawatt hours mwh from cspp facilities at a cost of million  resulting in a blended price of cents per kilowatt hour 
wholesale competition the national energy policy act and the ferc s rulemaking activities have established the regulatory framework to open the wholesale energy market to competition 
open access transmission for wholesale customers provides energy suppliers with opportunities to sell and deliver electricity at market based prices 
idaho power actively monitors and participates  as appropriate  in energy industry developments  to maintain and enhance its ability to effectively participate in wholesale energy markets in a manner consistent with its business goals 
wholesale energy market activities idaho power participates in the wholesale energy market by buying power to help meet load demands and selling power that is in excess of load demands 
idaho power s market activities are guided by a risk management policy and frequently updated operating plans and influenced by customer loads  market prices  and cost and availability of generating resources 
some of idaho power s hydroelectric generation facilities are operated to optimize the water that is available by choosing when to run generation units and when to store water in reservoirs 
these decisions affect the timing and volumes of market purchases and market sales 
even in below normal water years  there are opportunities to vary water usage to maximize generation unit efficiency  capture marketplace economic benefits and meet load demand 
wholesale energy market prices and compliance factors  such as allowable river stage elevation changes and flood control requirements  influence these dispatch decisions 
transmission services idaho power s generating facilities are interconnected through its integrated transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to achieve maximum load carrying capability and reliability 
idaho power s transmission system is directly interconnected with the transmission systems of the bonneville power administration bpa  avista corporation  pacificorp  northwestern energy and nv energy 
such interconnections  coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of the above entities  permit the interchange  purchase  and sale of power among all major electric systems in the west interconnecting with the winter peaking northern and summer peaking southern regions of the western power system 
idaho power provides wholesale transmission service and provides firm and non firm wheeling services for eligible transmission customers 
idaho power is a member of the western electricity coordinating council  the western systems power pool  the northwest power pool  the northern tier transmission group  and the north american energy standards board 
these groups have been formed to more efficiently coordinate transmission reliability and planning throughout the western grid 
resource planning idaho power filed its integrated resource plan irp with the ipuc and opuc in december idaho power updates the irp every two years 
the irp forecasts idaho power s load and resource situation for the next years  analyzes potential supply side and demand side options and identifies near term and long term actions 
the four primary goals of the irp are to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy within idaho power s service area throughout the year planning period  ensure the selected resource portfolio balances cost  risk and environmental concerns  give equal and balanced treatment to both supply side resources and demand side measures  and involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way 
the irp analyzed supply side resources  demand side management programs  and transmission options taking into account many factors including the estimated costs of complying with potential carbon legislation as part of determining the preferred resource portfolio 
the preferred portfolio positions idaho power for compliance with anticipated carbon regulations and a federal renewable electricity standard res 
due to the uncertainty regarding future carbon regulations  no new conventional coal resources were selected in the preferred portfolio 
during the development of the irp  idaho power conducted regular public meetings with the irp advisory council irpac 
the irpac members include the ipuc  the opuc  political  environmental  and customer representatives and representatives of other public interest groups 
irpac meetings also serve as the primary forum for involving the public in the planning process 
during the time between resource plan filings  the public and regulatory oversight of the activities identified in the irp allows for discussion and adjustment of the irp as warranted 
idaho power makes periodic adjustments and corrections to the resource plan to reflect changes in technology  economic conditions  anticipated resource development and regulatory requirements 
supply side resources the foundation of idaho power s energy resources is its company owned generation facilities including hydroelectric plants  two gas fired plants and co ownership in three coal fired plants discussed in item properties 
to balance out its resource needs  idaho power also utilizes long term ppa s to supply the energy needed to serve customers 
idaho power also has projects identified for construction that including the mw langley gulch combined cycle power plant  and a mw expansion of the shoshone falls hydroelectric facility 
idaho power is also planning the boardman to hemingway and the gateway west transmission lines and constructing the hemingway substation to improve reliability  relieve congestion and provide system flexibility for more information see item md a liquidity and capital resources capital requirements major projects 
the irp also included discussion related to the following resources geothermal rfps although the results of previously conducted geothermal request for proposal rfp processes have been disappointing  idaho power continues to work with project developers capable of delivering energy to the company s service area 
idaho power has included two mw increments of geothermal energy in the irp preferred portfolio  one in and one in wind rfp the irp preferred portfolio includes mw of wind generation coming on line in in may  idaho power issued an rfp for up to mw of wind generation to come on line no later than the end of idaho power accelerated the release of the wind rfp to take advantage of the benefits offered in the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra or the economic stimulus package 
proposals were received in june and idaho power expects to submit a contract to the ipuc for approval in the first half of combined heat and power chp rfp chp resources were not included in the irp preferred portfolio because of the level of uncertainty in being able to successfully develop a chp project 
however  idaho power continues to work with large customers and other parties to explore chp development opportunities 
in november  idaho power signed an agreement to jointly investigate a chp project with the idaho office of energy resources ioer and amalgamated sugar  one of idaho power s large industrial customers 
the agreement establishes the framework for a chp feasibility study to be performed at amalgamated sugar s nampa  idaho facility that could be as large as mw 
ioer and idaho power will jointly fund the study 
demand side management programs in  idaho power spent approximately million on energy efficiency and targeted demand reduction programs 
approximately million of funding for these programs came from idaho and oregon energy efficiency tariff riders 
the balance of the funding comes from idaho power base rates and from the remaining funds from the bpa s conservation and renewables discount  which was discontinued in idaho power has several energy efficiency programs in place and in development  targeting savings across the entire year and across a wide range of customer segments 
the emphasis of these programs is to reduce energy consumption  especially during periods of high demand and minimize or delay the need to build new supply side alternatives 
idaho power s programs include irrigation demand response and irrigation efficiency programs target irrigation customers with financial incentives for allowing idaho power to interrupt service to their irrigation pumps  and for either improving the energy efficiency of an irrigation system or installing a new energy efficiency system  residential air conditioning equipment control measures  residential energy efficiency programs targeted at new and existing homes  focusing on customer education and the application of energy efficiency remediation  including energy efficient building techniques  insulation augmentation  air duct sealing  and the use of efficient lighting  and industrial and commercial facilities application of energy efficient techniques and technologies  operational and management processes to reduce energy consumption  and a new industrial peak reduction program 
idaho power s revised irrigation peak rewards program design was approved by the ipuc in january participating customers receive a credit on their bills in exchange for allowing idaho power  within specified parameters  to interrupt service to their irrigation pumps during certain peak hours in a six week period in june and july 
the cost of the program was million in and is expected to increase to million by idaho power s voluntary commercial demand response program is for commercial and industrial customers larger than kilowatts and was approved in may by the ipuc 
idaho power signed a five year contract with a third party aggregator  enernoc  to operate the program and arranges with idaho power s customers to achieve peak reductions 
this program is dispatchable meaning idaho power will have flexibility to schedule peak reduction benefits during times of greatest need and is expected to increase to mw of summer peak demand reduction availability by the anticipated cost of the program is approximately million over its first five years 
approximately million of energy efficiency spending was related to research  analysis and development  education  technology evaluation  and market transformation 
some of this activity was done in conjunction with the northwest energy efficiency alliance neea 
idaho power contributed million to the neea in in  idaho power s energy efficiency programs reduced energy usage by approximately  mwh and the targeted demand reduction programs resulted in a summer peak reduction of about mw 
environmental regulation idaho power s activities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  regional and local laws and regulations designed to protect  restore and enhance the quality of the environment including air  water  and solid waste 
environmental regulation continues to impact idaho power s operations due to the cost of installation and operation of equipment and facilities required for compliance with such regulations  and the modification of system operations to accommodate such regulations 
in addition to generally applicable regulations  the ferc licenses issued for idaho power s hydroelectric generating plants have environmental requirements such as aeration of turbine water to meet dissolved gas and temperature standards in the tail waters downstream from the plants 
idaho power monitors these issues and reports the results to the appropriate regulatory agencies 
idaho power co owns three coal fired power plants and owns two natural gas combustion turbine power plants that are subject to a broad range of environmental requirements  including air quality regulation 
idaho power s environmental compliance costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future especially with potential additional regulation under discussion at the state and federal level 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other environmental issues  please see part ii  item md a environmental issues 
idaho power estimates its environmental expenditures  based upon present environmental laws and regulations  will be as follows  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afudc in millions of dollars studies and measures related to environmental concerns at hydroelectric facilities investments in environmental equipment and facilities at thermal plants total capital expenditures operating costs for environmental facilities hydroelectric operating costs for environmental facilities thermal total operations and maintenance ifs ifs invests primarily in affordable housing developments  which provide a return principally by reducing federal and state income taxes through tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits 
ifs generated tax credits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
ifs s portfolio also includes historic rehabilitation projects such as the empire building in boise  idaho 
ifs made million and million of new investments during and  respectively  and will continue to review future legislation for new opportunities for investment that will be commensurate with the ongoing needs of idacorp 
ifs has focused on a diversified approach to its investment strategy in order to limit both geographic and operational risk 
over percent of ifs s investments have been made through syndicated funds 
at december   the gross amount of ifs s portfolio equaled million in tax credit investments 
these investments cover states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
the underlying investments include over individual properties  of which all but three are administered through syndicated funds 
ida west ida west operates and has a percent interest in nine hydroelectric plants with a total generating capacity of mw 
four of the projects are located in idaho and five are in northern california 
all nine projects are qualifying facilities under purpa 
idaho power purchased all of the power generated by ida west s four idaho hydroelectric projects at a cost of million in and million in both and item a 
risk factors the following are factors that could have a significant impact on the operations and financial results of idacorp  inc and idaho power company and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements reduced hydroelectric generation can reduce revenues and increase costs  and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company has a predominately hydroelectric generating base 
because of idaho power company s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation  water can significantly affect its operations 
when hydroelectric generation is reduced  idaho power company must increase its use of generally more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power and opportunities for off system sales are reduced  which reduces revenues 
in addition  while idaho power company can expect to recover the majority of the net power supply costs above the level included in its rates  recovery of the excess amounts does not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year 
continuing declines in stream flows and over appropriation of water in idaho may reduce hydroelectric generation and revenues and increase costs 
the combination of declining snake river base flows  over appropriation of water and drought conditions have led to disputes among surface water and ground water irrigators  and the state of idaho 
recharging the eastern snake plain aquifer  which contributes to snake river flows  by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed solution to the dispute 
diversions from the snake river for aquifer recharge may further reduce snake river flows available for hydroelectric generation and reduce idaho power company s revenues and increase costs 
idaho power company s recent settlement agreement with the state of idaho resolves litigation regarding certain idaho power company water rights on the snake river and provides for ongoing snake river water issues to be addressed in the comprehensive aquifer management plan process 
however  there is no assurance that this process will lead to increased snake river stream flows for idaho power company s hydroelectric projects 
idaho power company also has initiated legal action against the us bureau of reclamation over the interpretation and effect of a contract with the us bureau of reclamation on the operation of the american falls reservoir and the release of water from that reservoir to be used at idaho power company s downstream hydroelectric projects 
the comprehensive aquifer management plan process and the resolution of the litigation may affect snake river flows available for hydroelectric generation and thereby reduce idaho power company revenues and increase costs 
idaho power company s reliance on coal and natural gas to fuel its power generation facilities exposes it to risk of increased costs and reduced earnings 
in addition to hydroelectric generation  idaho power company relies on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities 
market price increases in coal and natural gas can result in reduced earnings 
increases in demand for natural gas  including increases in demand due to greater industry reliance on natural gas for power generation  may result in market price increases  short term price volatility and or supply availability issues 
in addition  delivery of coal and natural gas depends upon gas pipelines  rail lines  rail cars and roadways 
any disruption in idaho power company s fuel supply may require the company to find alternative fuel sources at higher costs  to produce power from higher cost generation facilities or to purchase power from other sources at higher costs 
load growth in idaho power company s service territory exposes it to greater market and operational risk and could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
o increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy have resulted and may continue to result in increased reliance on purchased power to meet customer load requirements 
the price volatility of electricity has substantially increased from what it was at the inception of the power cost adjustment 
while idaho power company can expect to recover the majority of the net power supply costs above the amounts included in its rates  recovery of the excess amounts does not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year  and the remaining amount is absorbed by idaho power company which could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
o load growth can result in the need for additional investments in idaho power company s infrastructure to serve the new load 
if idaho power company were unable to secure timely rate relief from the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission or the federal energy regulatory commission to recover the costs of these additional investments  the resulting regulatory lag would have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows 
o load growth can create planning and operating difficulties for idaho power company that can negatively impact its ability to reliably serve customers 
weather can reduce power sales and revenues and reduce earnings and cash flows 
warmer than normal winters  cooler than normal summers and increased rainfall during the irrigation seasons will reduce retail revenues from power sales and may impact the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation 
extreme weather events can disrupt transmission and distribution systems and cause service interruptions and extended outages  and potentially interrupt use of generation resources 
disruption in transmission and distribution systems increases operations and maintenance expenses and reduces earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company s risk management policy and programs relating to hedging power and gas exposures and counterparty creditworthiness may not always perform as intended  and we may suffer economic losses 
idaho power company actively manages the market risk inherent in its energy related activities and counterparty credit positions 
idaho power company has procedures that monitor compliance with our risk management policies and programs  including verification of transactions  regular portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics and daily counterparty credit risk analysis 
however  actual hydroelectric and thermal generation  transmission availability and market prices may be significantly different than those originally planned for when we enter into our risk management positions 
the high volatility of these items creates uncertainty in the appropriate amount of hedging activity to pursue 
forecasts of future loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause idaho power company to over or under hedge actual resource needs  exposing the company to market risk on the over or under hedged position 
changes in market prices are also unpredictable and can at times result in idaho power company s hedged positions performing less favorably than unhedged positions 
in addition  idaho power company s counterparty credit policies may not prevent counterparties from failing to perform  forcing the company to replace forward contracts with transactions in the open market 
as a result  risk management decisions may have significant impacts if actual events result in greater losses or costs in delivering energy to customers and could negatively affect financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
increased capital expenditures can significantly affect liquidity 
increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of transmission and distribution systems and generating facilities 
if idaho power company does not receive timely regulatory recovery  idaho power company will have to rely more on external financing for its future utility construction expenditures 
these large planned expenditures may weaken the consolidated financial profile of idacorp  inc and idaho power company 
additionally  a significant portion of idaho power company s facilities were constructed many years ago 
aging equipment  even if maintained in accordance with industry practices  may require significant capital expenditures 
failure of equipment or facilities used in idaho power company s system could potentially increase repair and maintenance expenses  purchased power expenses and capital expenditures 
if the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission or the federal energy regulatory commission grant less rate recovery in rate case filings than idaho power company needs to cover increased costs of providing services  earnings and cash flows may be reduced 
if the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission or the federal energy regulatory commission grant less rate recovery in rate case filings than idaho power company needs to cover increased costs of providing services  it may have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows and could result in downgrades of idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit ratings 
climate change could affect customer demand and hydroelectric generation and disrupt transmission and distribution systems  reducing earnings and cash flows 
long term climate change could affect idaho power company s business in a variety of ways  including i changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customer demand  ii extreme weather events could increase service interruptions  outages  and maintenance costs  iii changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could adversely affect hydroelectric generation  and iv legislative and or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plans and operations including placing restrictions on the construction of new generation resources  the expansion of existing resources  or the operation of generation resources in general  and v consumer preference for  and resource planning decisions requiring  renewable or low ghg emitting sources of energy could impact demand from existing sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission resources 
any of these effects of climate change could reduce idaho power company s earnings and cash flows 
complying with environmental laws and regulations will increase capital expenditures and operating costs and may reduce idaho power company s earnings and cash flows and ability to meet the electricity needs of its customers 
idaho power company is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  natural resources and health and safety 
compliance with these environmental statutes  rules and regulations involves significant capital and operating expenditures 
congress is considering legislation to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions  and the environmental protection agency is taking action to address climate change and regulate greenhouse gas emissions  including the adoption of new reporting requirements that apply to idaho power company s facilities 
the environmental protection agency has also made an endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and has indicated that the clean air act will require it to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary sources  including idaho power company s thermal facilities  once it adopts greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles 
the adoption of a mandatory federal program to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels  specifically coal  as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
mercury and other pollutant emissions from idaho power company s thermal facilities are also subject to extensive regulation 
the adoption of new statutes  rules and regulations to reduce emissions  including controls to reduce carbon dioxide  greenhouse gas  mercury or other pollutant emissions will result in increased capital expenditures and could increase the cost of operating coal fired generating plants or make them uneconomical to operate and result in reduced earnings and cash flows 
complying with state or federal renewable energy portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
a number of states have adopted renewable energy portfolio standards 
idaho power company s operations in oregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable energy portfolio standard beginning in  and it is possible that idaho and other states in which idaho power company operates or sells power could adopt renewable energy portfolio standards in the future 
a bill passed by the us house of representatives on june   would  if enacted  require utilities to obtain as much as percent of their electricity from renewable sources by and reduce demand by an additional percent through conservation and increased energy efficiency 
a bill pending in the us senate would require percent of electricity from renewable sources by new state or federal renewable energy portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
the listing as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act of fish  wildlife or plant species that are found in the areas of idaho power company s generation facilities or transmission lines may require mitigation  affect the location of a project or the ability to construct a project and result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
relicensing of the hells canyon and swan falls hydroelectric projects and the construction of langley gulch and the gateway west and boardman to hemingway transmission lines require consultation under the endangered species act to determine the effects of these projects on any listed species within the project areas 
the recent listing of slickspot peppergrass as a threatened species will require an endangered species act consultation for the transmission and water lines for langley gulch as well as for the gateway west and boardman to hemingway transmission lines 
this listing may also affect idaho power company s ability to purchase wind power from any wind power farms that were to be built in these areas 
any negative effects of the listing of slickspot peppergrass or any other species under the endangered species act may require mitigation  cause a delay in relicensing or construction of projects  affect the location or ability to construct a project and increase the costs of construction and operations 
conditions that may be imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures  increase operating costs  reduce hydroelectric production and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company is currently involved in renewing federal licenses for several of its hydroelectric projects 
the federal energy regulatory commission may impose conditions with respect to environmental  operating and other matters in connection with the renewal of idaho power company s licenses 
these conditions could have a negative effect on idaho power company s operations  require large capital expenditures and increase operating costs  reduce hydroelectric production and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company s business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by increased costs resulting from  or liability under  existing or future regulations or requirements 
idaho power company is subject to extensive federal and state laws  policies  and regulations  as well as regulatory actions and regulatory audits  including those of the federal energy regulatory commission  the environmental protection agency  the north american electric reliability corporation  the western electricity coordinating council and the public utility commissions in idaho  oregon and wyoming 
some of these regulations are changing or subject to interpretation  and failure to comply may result in penalties or other adverse consequences 
idaho power company has reported compliance issues to the federal energy regulatory commission  and the western electricity coordinating council has recently completed an audit of reliability standards 
compliance with these requirements directly influences idaho power company s operating environment and may significantly increase idaho power company s operating costs 
idacorp  inc  its affiliate idacorp energy and idaho power company are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings  settlements  investigations and claims 
idacorp  inc  idacorp energy and idaho power company are involved in a number of proceedings  including the california refund proceeding  a portion of which remains pending before the federal energy regulatory commission and the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  a refund proceeding affecting sellers of wholesale power in the spot market in the pacific northwest  and show cause proceedings originating at the federal energy regulatory commission  a portion of which remains pending in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
it is possible that additional proceedings related to the western energy situation may be filed in the future against idacorp  inc  idacorp energy or idaho power company 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are or may also be subject to costs and other effects of additional legal claims  actions and complaints  including those related to the jim bridger  valmy and boardman coal fired plants  in which idaho power company holds an ownership interest 
state attorneys general have brought actions against companies  seeking additional disclosure of climate change related risks and impacts  and private parties have brought tort actions against companies relating to their alleged contribution to climate change 
if idacorp  inc  idacorp energy or idaho power company are required to make payments in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding  settlement  investigation or claim  earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected 
as a holding company  idacorp  inc does not have its own operating income and must rely on the upstream cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments 
idacorp  inc is a holding company and thus its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries  primarily idaho power company 
consequently  idacorp  inc s ability to pay dividends and to service its debt is dependent upon dividends and other payments received from its subsidiaries 
idacorp  inc s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to idacorp  inc  whether through dividends  loans or other payments 
the ability of idacorp  inc s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to idacorp  inc depends on several factors  including their actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial condition  regulatory restrictions  and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt securities 
a downgrade in idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit ratings could negatively affect the companies ability to access capital  increase their cost of borrowing  and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties 
credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long term ratings of idacorp  inc and idaho power company 
idacorp  inc 
and idaho power company also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper 
downgrades of idacorp  inc s or idaho power company s credit ratings  or those affecting relationship banks  could limit the companies ability to access capital  including the commercial paper markets  require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties 
volatility and decreased lending capacity in the financial markets may negatively affect idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s ability to access capital and or increase their cost of borrowing 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company require liquidity to pay operating expenses and principal of and interest on debt and to finance capital expenditures 
financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption  causing the cost of borrowing to rise and the availability of liquidity and credit for borrowers to decrease  as a result  idacorp  inc and idaho power company may experience higher interest costs and or be unable to access capital  including the commercial paper markets 
these conditions may adversely affect idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
one or more of the banks participating in idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit facilities could default on their obligations to fund loans requested by the companies or could withdraw from participation in the credit facilities  which could negatively affect cash flows and the ability to meet capital requirements 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company have million and million multi year revolving credit facilities  respectively  with a group of lender banks that expire in april these facilities supplement operating cash flow and provide a primary source of liquidity 
the facilities are also used as backup for commercial paper borrowings and are available for general corporate purposes 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are subject to the risk that one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under the credit facilities 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company s inability to obtain loans under their respective credit facilities as needed could negatively affect cash flows and the ability to meet capital requirements 
idacorp and idaho power company may incur losses on their investments or be unable to sell their investments when they desire to do so  which could adversely affect their liquidity and financial condition 
idacorp and idaho power company invest cash in short term interest bearing accounts  including money market funds 
volatility in the financial markets may result in a lack of liquidity and declines in value of some money market funds 
the companies may realize additional losses on some or all of their invested funds or be unable to sell their investments when they desire to do so 
this could adversely affect idacorp s and idaho power company s liquidity and financial condition 
national and regional economic conditions may cause increased late payments and uncollectible accounts  which would reduce earnings and cash flows 
recent concerns over energy costs  the availability and cost of credit  declining business and increased unemployment have contributed to a recession 
these factors have resulted  and may continue to result  in an increase in late payments and uncollectible accounts and reduce idacorp inc s and idaho power company s earnings and cash flows 
national and regional economic conditions  in conjunction with increased electric rates  may reduce energy consumption  which may reduce revenues and future growth 
the present economic recession and increased rates may reduce the amount of energy our customers consume  result in a loss of customers and reduce customer growth 
a decrease in overall customer usage may reduce revenues  earnings  and future growth 
adverse results of income tax audits could reduce earnings and cash flows 
the outcome of ongoing and future income tax audits could differ materially from the amounts currently recorded  and the difference could reduce idacorp s and idaho power company s earnings and cash flows 
employee workforce factors could increase costs and reduce earnings 
idaho power company is subject to workforce factors  including  but not limited to  loss or retirement of key personnel  availability of qualified personnel  an aging workforce  and impacts of efforts to organize workforce  including the possible unionization of one or more segments of the workforce

executive overview business strategy idacorp s business strategy emphasizes idaho power as idacorp s core business 
idaho power detailed a three part strategy of responsible planning  responsible development and protection of resources  and responsible energy use to ensure adequate energy supplies 
idaho power continues to evaluate and refine its business strategy to ensure coordination and integration with all functional areas of the company 
idaho power s business strategy balances the interest of owners  customers and employees while maintaining the company s financial stability and flexibility 
the strategy includes responsible planning idaho power s planning process is intended to ensure adequate generation and transmission resources to meet population growth and increasing electricity demand 
this planning process now integrates idaho power s regulatory strategies and financial planning  including the consideration of regional economic development in the growing communities we serve 
responsible development and protection of resources idaho power s business strategy has included the development and protection of generation  transmission  distribution and associated infrastructure  and natural resources idaho power depends upon 
the strategy now includes consideration of workforce planning  development and retention related to these strategic elements 
responsible energy use idaho power s business strategy has included energy efficiency and demand response programs and preparation for potential carbon and renewable portfolio standard legislation 
the strategy now includes targeted reductions relating to carbon emission intensity and public disclosure of reporting these reductions 
financial results idacorp s net income and earnings per diluted share for the last three years were as follows net income attributable to idacorp  inc average outstanding shares diluted s earnings per diluted share the following table presents a reconciliation of idacorp net income for to in millions net income attributable to idacorp  inc change in idaho power net income before taxes rate and other regulatory changes  net of pca and fca mechanisms reduced sales volumes increase in other operations and maintenance expense  excluding fca increase in depreciation expense oatt rate refund investment impairment other net increases decrease in income tax expense total increase in idaho power net income decreased net income at ifs net of tax decrease in expenses at holding company net of tax other net decreases net of tax net income attributable to idacorp  inc changes to the idaho power cost adjustment pca mechanism and base rate increases that both took effect in the first quarter of  positively impacted net income as did decreased net power supply costs 
earnings in also increased due to a may oregon public utility commission opuc stipulation allowing the deferral for future recovery of million of excess power supply costs incurred in idaho power s retail customer sales volumes decreased four percent in as compared to irrigation usage decreased percent primarily due to increased precipitation 
economic factors and energy conservation also contributed to the reduction in sales volume 
other o m expense increased due to an increase in payroll related expenses and uncollectible accounts and was partially offset by decreases in outside services and other office expenses 
depreciation expense increased mainly due to the accelerated depreciation of the existing meter infrastructure 
two items that positively impacted the comparison of to results relate to activities that did not recur in  an oatt rate refund ordered by the ferc that reduced transmission revenue and an impairment of investments 
idaho power s effective income tax rate decreased primarily due to examination settlements and the timing and amount of other regulatory flow through tax adjustments  partially offset by the tax expense on higher pre tax income 
there was no accelerated amortization of deferred investment tax credits during as the idaho jurisdictional earnings exceeded percent of the idaho retail common equity  as permitted by the idaho settlement agreement 
regulatory matters idaho power has a number of pending or recently completed regulatory filings 
regulatory matters are discussed in more detail later in the md a 
idaho settlement agreement in january  the ipuc approved a settlement agreement among idaho power  several of idaho power s customers  the ipuc staff and others with respect to rates for the settlement contains four important elements a general rate freeze until january   with some exceptions  a specified distribution of the expected pca decrease to directly reduce customer rates  providing some general rate relief to idaho power and resetting base level power supply costs for the pca going forward  use of investment tax credits to get to a percent return on equity in the idaho jurisdiction  and an equal sharing of any idaho earnings exceeding the authorized level of percent 
oregon general rate case in december  idaho power filed a joint stipulation and testimony in support of a stipulation that would settle the revenue requirement issues surrounding the general rate case filed on july  if approved by the opuc  the joint stipulation would result in a million  or percent  increase to base rates 
the new rates reflect a return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
the requested effective date for new rates is march  oregon annual power cost update in october  idaho power filed the october update portion of its annual power cost update apcu 
the filing reflects that revenues associated with idaho power s base net power supply costs would increase million over the previous october update  an average percent increase 
the actual impact of the apcu will be determined once the march forecast portion is filed in march and combined with the october update 
final rates are expected to become effective on june  oregon excess power cost deferrals may december excess power costs in may  the opuc adopted a stipulation allowing idaho power to defer excess net power supply costs of million including interest through the date of the order for the period may through december  idaho power recorded this deferral in the second quarter of idaho and oregon rate orders idaho power received five additional rate orders from the ipuc and the opuc at the end of may the ipuc rate orders are for the fixed cost adjustment mechanism  idaho energy efficiency rider  advanced metering infrastructure ami  and pca  and the opuc rate order is for the annual power cost update 
each of these orders increases rates  but only the ami order  relating to the installation of new meters  increases idaho power s rate base 
open access transmission tariff oatt amended legacy agreements in  idaho power submitted filings to the ferc to increase rates under two agreements idaho power has with pacificorp and to terminate certain contract services  replacing them with oatt service 
the ferc accepted one of idaho power s filings  effective june   for a net annualized revenue increase of million 
the ferc accepted the second filing and suspended the rates  setting the case for settlement judge procedures and hearing 
idaho power began collecting the new rates effective august   with a net annualized revenue increase of million 
settlement discussions are ongoing 
the impact of these revised agreements on transmission revenue is expected to be a million increase as compared with integrated resource plan irp idaho power filed the irp with the ipuc and opuc in december  the irp addresses available supply side and demand side resource options  planning period load forecasts  potential resource portfolios  a risk analysis and near term and long term action plans 
liquidity idacorp and idaho power expect to continue financing capital requirements with a combination of internally generated funds and externally financed capital 
in  idacorp issued  common stock shares through its continuous equity program at an average price of per share for proceeds of million 
in march  idaho power issued million of its first mortgage bonds and in november  idaho power issued million of its first mortgage bonds 
in december  idaho power repaid million of its first mortgage bonds 
these matters are discussed in more detail in liquidity and capital resources later in the md a 
capital requirements idaho power has several major projects in development 
the most significant projects are summarized here and are discussed further in liquidity and capital resources capital requirements major projects 
langley gulch power plant langley gulch will be a natural gas fired combined cycle combustion turbine ccct generating plant with a summer nameplate capacity of approximately mws and a winter capacity of approximately mws 
the plant will be constructed at an estimated cost of million near new plymouth  idaho commencing in summer  and is anticipated to achieve commercial operation by november  contract incentives may advance the commercial operation date to july  idaho power received cost recovery and ratemaking assurances from the ipuc for this project 
transmission projects the boardman hemingway line is a proposed kv line between a substation near boardman  oregon and the hemingway substation 
idaho power estimates total construction costs of million and expects its share of the project to be between and percent 
idaho power estimates the project will be completed in idaho power and pacificorp are jointly exploring gateway west  a project to build transmission lines between windstar  a substation located near douglas  wyoming and hemingway substation 
the current estimated cost for idaho power s share of the project is between million and million 
initial phases of the project could be completed by idaho power s share may change and the timing of the projects segments may be deferred and constructed as demand requires 
pension plan as idaho power s pension plan is below the minimum required funding levels at january   future minimum contributions are required 
based on the assumptions allowed under the ppa  wrera  treasury guidance and irs guidance  idacorp and idaho power were not required to contribute to the pension plan in  and estimated minimum required contributions will be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in on october   idaho power filed an application with the ipuc requesting the clarification of a pension recovery method for cash contributions made to the pension plan 
on february   the ipuc approved a recovery methodology that would permit idaho power to include in future rate cases a reasonable amortization and recovery of cash contributions 
the amortization of deferred pension costs is expected to match the revenues received as future pension contributions are recovered through rates 
approximately million  million and million of pension expenses were deferred as a regulatory asset in   and  respectively 
other issues water management issues power generation at the idaho power hydroelectric power plants on the snake river depends on the state water rights held by idaho power and the long term sustainability of the snake river  tributary spring flows and the eastern snake plain aquifer that is connected to the snake river 
idaho power continues to participate in water management issues in idaho that may affect those water rights and resources with the goal to preserve  to the fullest extent possible  the long term availability of water for use at idaho power s hydroelectric projects on the snake river 
for a further discussion of water management issues see legal matters snake river basin water rights 
environmental issues long term climate change could significantly affect idaho power s business and climate change regulations are expected to have major implications for idaho power and the energy industry 
on september   idacorp s and idaho power s board of directors approved guidelines that established a goal to reduce the carbon dioxide co emission intensity of idaho power s utility operations 
the guidelines are intended to further prepare idaho power for potential legislative and or regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas ghg emissions while minimizing the costs of complying with such restrictions on idaho power s customers 
idaho power  along with its partners in its coal plants  is required to monitor and report quarterly to the environmental protection agency epa their ghg emissions beginning january  the epa has indicated that it will begin to regulate ghg emissions from stationary sources  including idaho power s facilities  through its new source review and operating permit programs when the regulations relating to ghg emissions from motor vehicles are finalized 
idaho power s thermal facilities are also subject to epa and or state promulgated i national ambient air quality standards including those for ozone and fine particulate matter  ii laws and regulations limiting mercury emissions  iii regional haze best available retrofit technology requirements and iv new source review and performance standards 
idaho power s environmental compliance costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future  particularly in light of possible additional regulation at the federal and state levels 
these issues are discussed in more detail in environmental issues 
boardman coal plant on january   portland general electric announced that it intended to pursue an alternative operating plan  subject to regulatory approval for its boardman coal fired electricity generation plant 
under the plan  near term expenditures for pollution control equipment would be significantly reduced and the plant would either cease to operate in  or it would discontinue the use of coal as a fuel source 
idaho power is a ten percent owner of the plant  representing  kw of nameplate capacity 
at december   idaho power s net book value in the boardman plant was million with annual depreciation of approximately million 
american recovery and reinvestment act of under the arra  idaho power submitted a grant application to the department of energy doe in august  requesting million 
this grant would match a million investment by idaho power in smart grid technology as well as other incremental projects 
in october  idaho power received notice that its application was selected for negotiation 
negotiations with the doe on the grant agreement terms are expected to be completed in the first quarter of key operating and financial metrics estimate actual idaho power operation maintenance expense millions idaho power capital expenditures millions idaho power hydroelectric generation million mwh non regulated subsidiary earnings and holding company expenses millions effective income tax rates idaho power consolidated idacorp the range for capital expenditures includes amounts for langley gulch power plant  the hemingway bowmont transmission line  the hemingway substation and expenditures for the siting and permitting of major transmission expansions for the boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission projects 
the projected range for annual hydroelectric generation is based on snake river basin snowpack at percent of average on february   with reservoir storage levels in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee at approximately percent of average as of february  the effective income tax rate ranges include the utilization of up to million of additional deferred investment tax credit aditc amortization at idaho power 
the rates do not reflect discrete events such as examination settlements or method changes 
results of operations this section of the md a takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected idacorp s and idaho power s earnings over the last three years 
in this analysis  the results of are compared to and the results of are compared to the following table presents earnings losses for idacorp and its subsidiaries idaho power idacorp financial services idacorp energy ida west energy holding company expenses discontinued operations net income attributable to idacorp  inc average outstanding shares diluted s earnings per diluted share utility operations operating environment idaho power primarily uses its hydroelectric and coal fired generation facilities and long term power purchase agreements to supply the energy needed to serve customers 
regional energy market purchases and sales are used to balance supply and demand throughout the year 
idaho power develops operation plans during the year to provide guidance for generation resource utilization and energy market activities 
idaho power s energy risk management policy and unit operating requirements provide the framework for the plans 
the plans incorporate forecasts for generation unit availability  reservoir storage and stream flows  gas and coal prices  customer loads and energy market prices 
in developing its plans  idaho power determines to what extent its own resources can be used to meet forecast loads and when to transact in the regional energy market 
the allocation of hydroelectric generation between heavy load and light load hours or calendar periods is also a consideration 
this allocation is intended to utilize the flexibility of the hydroelectric system to shift generation to high value periods  while operating within the constraints imposed on the system 
hydroelectric generation depends on stream flows in the snake river  on which most of idaho power s hydroelectric facilities are built 
stream flows are dependent on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of idaho power s hydroelectric facilities  springtime snow pack run off  river base flows  spring flows  rainfall and other weather and stream flow management considerations 
idaho power also leases water from third parties to augment stream flows and increase its ability to meet mid summer electricity demands with lower cost hydroelectric generation and to offset the impact of drought and changing water use patterns in southern idaho 
when hydroelectric generation is reduced  idaho power has less electricity available for off system sales and  most likely  will increase its use of purchased power to meet load requirements  resulting in increased power supply costs 
during good water years  increased off system sales and the decreased need for purchased power reduce power supply costs 
regional energy market prices can also be affected by hydroelectric generating conditions 
in times with high hydroelectric generation the availability of abundant energy tends to reduce wholesale prices  and during low hydroelectric generation wholesale prices tend to be higher 
a combination of increased precipitation  higher reservoir storage releases and the purchase of leased water resulted in million mwh generated from idaho power s hydroelectric facilities in  compared to million mwh in and million in hydroelectric generation was percent of the year average in the observed stream flow data released in august  by the us army corps of engineers  northwest division indicated that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july was million acre feet maf  compared to maf in april july annual brownlee reservoir inflow for was maf  or percent of the nwrfc average compared to maf in and maf in storage in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee as of february   was percent of average 
the stream flow forecast released on february   by the nwrfc predicts that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july will be maf  or percent of the nwrfc average 
the following table presents idaho power s energy sales and supply in mwhs for the last three years general business sales off system sales total energy sales hydroelectric generation coal generation natural gas and other generation total system generation purchased power line losses total energy supply idaho power s modeled median annual hydroelectric generation is million mwh  based on hydrologic conditions for the period through and adjusted to reflect the current level of water resource development 
general business revenue rate actions have significantly impacted general business revenue over the last three years 
the following table presents significant rate increases during that period 
these and other rate actions are discussed further in regulatory matters and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
percentage annualized description effective date increase increase millions pca idaho general rate case pca danskin plant idaho general rate case idaho general rate case pca ami the primary influences on electricity sales volumes are weather  customer demand and economic conditions 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales 
precipitation levels during the agricultural growing season affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps 
increased precipitation reduces electricity usage by these customers 
the following table presents boise  idaho weather conditions for the last three years normal heating degree days cooling degree days precipitation inches heating and cooling degree days are common measures used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and air conditioning 
a degree day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from degrees 
each degree of temperature above degrees is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below degrees is counted as one heating degree day 
the following table presents idaho power s general business revenues  mwh sales and average and year end number of customers for the last three years revenue residential commercial industrial irrigation deferred revenue related to hells canyon relicensing afudc total mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total customers average residential commercial industrial irrigation total customers year end residential commercial industrial irrigation total vs 
rates rate changes positively impacted general business revenue by million in as compared to pca rate increases accounted for million of the increases and base rate changes contributed million 
also  a new tiered rate structure for residential and small commercial customers was implemented february   as part of the general rate case 
the table below presents the residential rates by tier 
idaho residential rate structure february  summer non summer february  summer non summer kwh cents cents kwh cents cents above kwh cents cents  kwh cents cents above  kwh cents cents customers general business revenues increased million due to customer growth of one percent 
usage changes in usage decreased general business revenue million 
irrigation usage decreased percent primarily due to increased precipitation 
commercial and industrial usage also declined due to a weaker economy and increased energy efficiency 
idaho power does have in place the load growth adjustment rate lgar and fca mechanisms  both of which diminish the impact of changes in sales volumes from levels included in base rates 
vs 
rates rate changes positively impacted general business revenue by million in as compared to pca rate increases accounted for million of the increases and base rate changes contributed million of the increase 
customers general business customer growth of two percent increased revenue million 
usage changes in usage  primarily resulting from cooler summer temperatures  decreased general business revenue million 
off system sales off system sales consist primarily of long term sales contracts and opportunity sales of surplus system energy 
the following table presents idaho power s off system sales for the last three years revenue mwh sold revenue per mwh vs 
off system sales revenue declined percent in due to lower market prices  partially offset by increased sales 
prices for wholesale power in the northwest were much lower than in due to an abundance of energy in the region during the spring and fall and due to lower energy commodity prices 
improved hydroelectric generating conditions and lower system load increased the amount of electricity available for sale 
the off system sales revenue per mwh is nearly percent lower than the purchased power cost per mwh 
in accordance with idaho power s risk management policy  idaho power made forward purchases of energy for delivery in the third quarter of most of the purchases were identified and made months in advance when market prices were higher 
in the third quarter  reduced demand and improved generating conditions caused regional energy market prices to drop and idaho power to have additional surplus energy available for sale off system into that lower price energy market 
vs 
off system sales revenue declined percent in sales volumes decreased due to changes to idaho power s risk management policy guidelines implemented in that resulted in less forward sales activity 
revenue per mwh increased due to the impact of higher energy commodity prices through much of other revenues the following table presents the components of other revenues transmission services and property rental energy efficiency total vs 
other revenues increased million due mainly to the following transmission revenues increased million due primarily to oatt rate refunds ordered by the ferc reducing revenues 
idaho power recorded approximately million of refunds related to transmission sales from prior years 
the oatt is discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  and energy efficiency revenues increased million 
these revenues mirror program expenditures and result in a zero net impact on net income 
energy efficiency revenues and expenses have steadily increased as program activity has increased 
vs 
other revenues decreased million due mainly to the following transmission revenues decreased million  due primarily to the aforementioned oatt rate refunds and to oatt rate decreases  and energy efficiency revenues increased million 
energy efficiency activities are funded through a rider mechanism on customer bills 
energy efficiency program expenditures are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount of revenues recorded in other revenues  resulting in no net impact on earnings 
the cumulative variance between expenditures and amounts collected through the rider is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability pending future collection from or obligation to customers 
an asset balance indicates that idaho power has spent more than it has collected and a liability balance indicates that idaho power has collected more than it has spent 
at december   idaho power s rider balance was a regulatory asset of million 
purchased power the following table presents idaho power s purchased power expenses and volumes expense mwh purchased cost per mwh purchased vs 
purchased power expense decreased million due to lower system load and more favorable hydroelectric generating conditions  which decreased the amount of purchased power idaho power needed to serve loads 
vs 
purchased power expense decreased million due to improved hydroelectric generation conditions and more normal weather  which allowed idaho power to better utilize its own generation resources 
despite improved water conditions in the region  overall market prices remained higher early in the year due to a gradual spring runoff and a need to re fill reservoirs 
in addition  increases in energy commodity prices impacted the electricity market 
fuel expense the following table presents idaho power s fuel expenses and generation at its coal and natural gas generating plants expense coal natural gas and other total fuel expense mwh generated coal natural gas and other total mwh generated cost per mwh coal natural gas weighted average  all sources vs 
fuel expense remained nearly the same due to offsetting variances 
the decrease in generation is due to lower system loads and lower wholesale energy prices  which resulted in reduced dispatch due to economics  and an unplanned mid year maintenance outage at boardman 
coal prices were higher in due to an increase in operating costs at bridger coal company  which supplies coal to the jim bridger plant  as well as higher prices for coal delivered to the boardman plant 
vs 
fuel expense increased million due to higher coal prices at the valmy and jim bridger plants 
coal prices at valmy increased percent due to higher transportation costs 
production costs at bridger coal company were percent higher due to difficulties with its underground longwall mining operation in january and february  the continued transition to underground mining operations  and rising prices for fuel and other commodities 
the increases were partially offset by a nine percent reduction in fuel expense at idaho power s natural gas fired plants  which had favorable market conditions in the fourth quarter due to pipeline transportation constraints in the region 
pca pca expense represents the effects of the idaho and oregon power supply costs deferral mechanisms  which are discussed in more detail below in regulatory matters power supply cost deferrals 
in each year presented  net power supply costs were higher than the amounts estimated in the annual pca forecast  resulting in the deferral of costs for recovery in subsequent rate years 
as the deferred costs are recovered in rates  the deferred balances are amortized 
the following table presents the components of the pca idaho power supply cost deferral oregon power supply cost deferral oregon excess power cost order amortization of prior year authorized balances total power cost adjustment vs 
the million change in the pca is due primarily to lower deferral of power supply costs and higher amortization of previously deferred power supply costs 
in addition  an order from the opuc that allows idaho power to defer for future recovery million of costs incurred in was recorded in may vs 
the million change in pca expense is due primarily to higher amortization from prior year excess net power supply costs to match increased revenues 
other operations and maintenance o m expenses vs 
other o m expenses increased million due primarily to an million increase in labor related charges and a million increase in charges for uncollectible accounts  partially offset by decreases of million in legal  other contracted services and office supplies due to cost containment measures 
the deterioration of the economy across idaho power s service area led to an increase in uncollectible accounts to approximately million representing approximately a half percent of general business revenues for the reserve for uncollectible accounts has also increased over levels most notably the residential and commercial reserves 
vs 
other o m expenses increased million due mainly to an million increase in labor related charges  a million increase due to new water leases  a million increase in uncollectible accounts due to economic conditions  and an increase of million for workers compensation  legal and other outside services 
the increases were partially offset by a million decrease in fca charges  a million decrease in transmission costs due to lower purchased power volumes and lower thermal o m expense of million due to lower annual outage costs 
energy efficiency energy efficiency activities are funded through a rider mechanism on customer bills 
energy efficiency program expenditures are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount of revenues recorded in other revenues  resulting in no net impact on earnings 
energy efficiency expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively

energy marketing in  ie wound down its power marketing operations  closed its business locations and sold its forward book of electricity trading contracts to sempra energy trading 
in  all trading contracts expired 
ie has not recorded any material net income for the years presented 
currently  ie has no operations but has been working to settle outstanding legal matters surrounding transactions in the california energy markets in and discontinued operations discontinued operations presents the results of operations of idacomm  inc prior to its sale in early income taxes idaho power is currently evaluating a tax accounting method change that would allow a current income tax deduction for repair related expenditures on its utility assets that are currently capitalized for book and tax purposes 
the deduction would be computed for tax years and forward 
idaho power has the ability to apply for this method change following the automatic consent procedures and could make such application with the filing of idacorp s consolidated federal income tax return in september idaho power s prescribed regulatory accounting treatment requires immediate income recognition for temporary tax differences of this type 
a regulatory asset is established to reflect idaho power s ability to recover increased income tax expense when such temporary differences reverse 
status of audit proceedings in december  the irs began its examination of idacorp s tax year 
the exam was completed in may the irs began its examination of idacorp s tax years in july and completed the exam in december 
the examination report was submitted to the us congress joint committee on taxation jct for review in june and was accepted without change in july 
tax years did not require jct review 
the settlement of these years resulted in a net income tax benefit of million for at both idacorp and idaho power 
in may  idacorp formally entered the irs compliance assurance process cap program for its tax year 
the cap program provides for irs examination throughout the year 
the examination is expected to be completed in in january  idacorp was accepted into cap for its tax year 
idacorp and idaho power are unable to predict the outcome of these examinations 
specifically within the cap examination  the irs began its audit of idaho power s current method of uniform capitalization 
in september  the irs issued industry director directive idd which discusses the irs s compliance priorities and audit techniques related to the allocation of mixed service costs in the uniform capitalization methods of electric utilities 
the irs and idaho power are jointly evaluating the impact the idd guidance has on idaho power s uniform capitalization method 
idaho power expects that the examination will be completed during liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows idacorp s operating cash flows are driven principally by idaho power 
general business revenues and the costs to supply power to general business customers are factors that have the greatest impact on idaho power s operating cash flows  and are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and idaho power s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs and provide a return on investment 
idacorp s and idaho power s operating cash inflows for the year ended december   were million and million  respectively 
these amounts were an increase of million and million  respectively  compared to the year ended december  the following are significant items that affected operating cash flows in in  pca rates more closely matched actual net power supply costs than in this more timely recovery of current costs improved cash flows by approximately million compared to in addition  the collection of deferred net power supply costs increased million compared to changes in net cash paid and refunded for income taxes improve cash flows by million and million at idacorp and idaho power  respectively  primarily due to audit settlements 
a refund of million was made to idaho power s transmission customers upon a final order from the ferc on idaho power s oatt 
the oatt is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income increased by approximately million and million at idacorp and idaho power  respectively  compared to idacorp s and idaho power s operating cash flows for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively 
these amounts were an increase of million and million  respectively  compared to the year ended december  the following are significant items that affected operating cash flows in collection of previously deferred net power supply costs increased million compared to income tax payments increased million and million for idacorp and idaho power  respectively  due to the timing of and increases in taxable income 
investing cash flows idaho power s construction expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
idaho power is experiencing a cycle of heavy infrastructure investment needed to address customer growth  peak demand growth  and aging plant and equipment 
net proceeds from the sales of emission allowances provided investing cash of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the changes were primarily caused by changes in the number of allowances sold each year as well as changes in market prices 
in august  idaho power reimbursed idacorp for the million refundable tax deposit idacorp made on idaho power s behalf with the irs related to a disputed income tax assessment 
in may  idaho power withdrew million from the deposit and in december the remainder of the deposit was applied to accrued taxes and interest 
income tax matters are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements

idaho power intends to file a new shelf registration statement that can be used for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and unsecured debt 
please see note to idacorp s and idaho power s consolidated financial statements for more information regarding long term financing arrangements 
credit facilities idacorp and idaho power each have a five year credit agreement that terminates on april   which is used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back up and provides for the issuance of loans and standby letters of credit 
idacorp s facility permits borrowings of up to million at any one time outstanding  which may be increased upon request to million 
idaho power s facility permits borrowings of up to million at any one time outstanding  which may be increased upon request to million 
each company may request one year extensions of the then existing termination date 
interest on borrowings under the facilities is a eurodollar rate or a floating rate  plus a margin determined by the company s ratings on its senior unsecured long term debt securities 
the companies also pay a utilization fee and a facility fee 
each facility contains a covenant requiring a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of no more than percent as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
at december   the leverage ratio for idacorp was percent and for idaho power was percent 
there are additional covenants  subject to exceptions  that prohibit or restrict certain investments or acquisitions  mergers or sale or disposition of property without consent  the creation of certain liens  and any agreements restricting dividend payments to the company from any material subsidiary 
at december   idacorp and idaho power were in compliance with all facility covenants 
the events of default under the facilities include nonpayment of principal  interest and fees  when due or subject to a grace period  materially false representations or warranties  breach of covenants  subject in some instances to grace periods  bankruptcy or insolvency related events  default in the payment of indebtedness in excess of million  defaults that will permit acceleration of such debt  or the acceleration of any of such debt  the acquisition of percent of the outstanding voting shares of the company  the failure of idacorp to own all of the outstanding voting stock of idaho power  unfunded liabilities of all single employer plans under the employee retirement income security act of erisa exceeding million  and environmental proceedings  investigations or violations of law  which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect 
the facilities were amended effective february  at the request of idacorp and idaho power because of their concern about continuing compliance with the unfunded liability provisions 
the amendments removed representations and default provisions relating to unfunded liabilities of all single employer plans in excess of million and replaced them with representations and default provisions relating to meeting the minimum funding standards and not requesting a funding waiver under the internal revenue code or erisa 
unfunded liabilities will now be relevant and measured only upon notice of termination of a plan and will then constitute a default only if they exceed million 
a default or an acceleration of indebtedness of idacorp or idaho power in excess of million  including indebtedness under the applicable facility  will result in a cross default under the other facility 
upon any bankruptcy or insolvency related event of default  the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable 
upon any other event of default  the lenders holding percent of the outstanding loans or of the aggregate commitments may terminate or suspend the obligations to make loans or declare the obligations to be due and payable 
a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing  but would not result in a default or acceleration of the debt under the facilities 
if idaho power s ratings are downgraded below investment grade  idaho power must extend or renew its authority for borrowings under its ipuc and opuc regulatory orders 
the ipuc order provides that idaho power s authority will continue for days from such downgrade  if idaho power promptly notifies the ipuc and files to continue its original authority to borrow 
the oregon statutes permit the issuance of short term debt without approval of the opuc 
without additional approval from the ipuc  the opuc and the public service commission of wyoming  the aggregate amount of short term borrowings by idaho power at any one time outstanding may not exceed million

currently there are no expenditures anticipated for or american recovery and reinvestment act of under the arra  idaho power submitted a grant application to the department of energy doe in august  requesting million 
this grant would match a million investment by idaho power in smart grid technology as well as other incremental projects 
in october  idaho power received notice that its application was selected for negotiation 
negotiations with the doe on the grant agreement terms are expected to be complete in the first quarter of off balance sheet arrangements idaho power has agreed to guarantee the performance of reclamation activities at bridger coal company of which ierco owns a one third interest 
this guarantee  which is renewed each december  was million at december  bridger coal company has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs 
at this time bridger coal company is revising their estimate of future reclamation costs 
to ensure that the reclamation trust fund maintains adequate reserves  bridger coal company has the ability to add a per ton surcharge if it is determined that future liabilities exceed the trust s assets 
because of the existence of the fund and the ability to apply a per ton surcharge  the estimated fair value of this guarantee is minimal

regulatory matters rate changes and regulatory decisions have a significant impact on results of operations and cash flows 
this section discusses several important rate matters that have affected results during the past two years  as well as significant pending regulatory issues 
regulatory matters and the financial impact of rate decisions are also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
idaho power has continued to focus on timely recovery of its costs through filings with the ipuc and opuc 
the table below summarizes the most significant base rate changes during the last two years 
annualized effective impact description date millions notes base rate increases idaho general rate case no rates of return were specified in the settlement danskin power plant adds million to rate base for this project general rate case provides a return on equity of percent and overall rate of return of percent 
approximately million related to increases in base net power supply costs 
allowed idaho power to include in rates approximately million relating to afudc on the hells canyon complex relicensing project 
ami order is based on idaho power s projected investment in ami through december  allowed idaho power to begin three year accelerated depreciation of existing metering equipment on june  the associated increase in annualized depreciation expense is million 
oregon annual power cost update represents a percent increase in oregon rates 
depreciation filing ami authorizes accelerated depreciation and recovery of existing meters in the oregon jurisdiction over an month period beginning january the associated increase in annual depreciation expense is million annual power cost update represents an percent increase in oregon rates 
idaho settlement agreement on january   the ipuc approved a settlement agreement among idaho power  several of idaho power s customers  the ipuc staff and others 
significant elements of the settlement agreement include a general rate moratorium in effect until january  the moratorium does not apply to other specified revenue requirement proceedings  such as the pca  the fca  pension funding  ami  energy efficiency rider  and government imposed fees 
a specified distribution of the expected pca 
this distribution is intended to reduce customer rates  provide some general rate relief to idaho power and reset base power supply costs for the pca 
the associated rate change is expected to become effective june  this provision is in anticipation of a significant reduction in pca rates for the pca year 
the pca reduction will be allocated as follows o the first million will be allocated equally between customers and idaho power 
idaho power s share would be applied to increase permanent base rates on a uniform percentage basis to all customer classes and contract customers 
the customers share would be a direct pca rate reduction 
o all of the next million will be allocated to customers as a direct pca rate reduction 
o pca reductions in excess of million will be applied to absorb any increase in the base level of net power supply expenses 
o if the pca reduction exceeds million plus the increase in base net power supply expenses  the next million will be allocated equally between idaho power and customers 
o any remainder will go entirely to customers 
a provision to share earnings with customers if idaho power s actual rate of return on equity is more than percent in any calendar year from to in its idaho jurisdiction 
idaho power will share with idaho customers percent of any returns in excess of percent 
a provision to allow the accelerated amortization of accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc if idaho power s actual rate of return on equity is below percent in any calendar year from to in its idaho jurisdiction 
idaho power would be permitted to amortize additional aditc in an amount up to million over the three year period  but could use no more that million in any one year unless there is a carryover 
carryover amounts are added to the million annual allowance up to a maximum amortization of million in any one year 
because idaho power s idaho jurisdiction return on equity was between and percent  the sharing and accelerated amortization provisions were not triggered in the settlement agreement also included a provision to reestablish the base level for net power supply costs effective with the june   pca rate change 
on january   idaho power filed with the ipuc a request to increase base net power supply costs by million in the idaho jurisdiction 
this amount  which is subject to approval by the ipuc  reflects the maximum increase to idaho power s base net power supply costs  which would be used for both base rates and pca calculations 
the actual change in net power supply costs for rate purposes will depend upon the amount approved by the ipuc as well as the amount of any pca decrease determined for the pca year 
written comments or protests with respect to idaho power s application are due march  oregon rate case on december   idaho power filed a joint stipulation and testimony in support of a stipulation that would settle the revenue requirement issues surrounding the general rate case filed on july  if approved by the opuc  the joint stipulation would result in a million  or percent  increase to base rates 
the new rates reflect a return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
the requested effective date for new rates is march  power supply cost deferrals idaho power s power supply costs can vary significantly from year to year  primarily because of weather  loads and commodity markets 
idaho power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in both idaho and oregon 
these mechanisms allow idaho power to recover from or refund to customers a majority of the fluctuations in power supply costs 
because of these mechanisms  the primary financial impacts of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period  resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year 
the following table summarizes idaho power s deferred power supply cost activity during the last two years 
idaho oregon total balance at january  costs deferred through pca and pcam prior costs expensed and recovered through rates so allowances credited to account interest and other balance at december  costs deferred through pca and pcam prior costs expensed and recovered through rates so allowances credited to account interest and other excess power costs order balance at december  oregon power supply cost deferrals are subject to a statute that specifically limits rate amortizations of deferred costs to six percent of gross oregon revenue per year approximately million 
deferrals are amortized sequentially 
the ipuc has allowed idaho power to retain its pca sharing percentage of the gain from sales of so allowances as a shareholder benefit with the remainder recorded as a customer benefit  substantially all of which was used to reduce the pca 
proceeds from the sale of renewable energy certificates recs are also expected to reduce the pca 
recs are acquired by idaho power through purchases of renewable energy 
pca workshops in its order approving idaho power s pca  the ipuc directed idaho power to set up workshops with the ipuc staff and several of idaho power s largest customers to address issues not resolved in that pca filing 
the workshops resulted in the following changes to the pca mechanism  effective february  pca sharing ratio the pca allocates the deviations in net power supply expenses between customers percent and shareholders percent 
the previous sharing ratio was lgar the lgar is an element of the pca formula that is intended to eliminate recovery of power supply expenses associated with load growth resulting from changing weather conditions  a growing customer base  or changing customer use patterns 
the general rate case reset the lgar from to per mwh  but applied that rate to only percent of the load growth beginning in march the stipulation agreed on a new formula for calculating the lgar 
based on the final rates approved by the ipuc in the general rate case and the supporting data  the current lgar is per mwh  effective february  use of idaho power s operation plan power supply cost forecast the operation plan forecast may better match current collections with actual net power supply costs in the year they are incurred and result in smaller amounts being included in the following year s true up rate  beginning with the pca filing 
inclusion of third party transmission expense transmission expenses paid to third parties to facilitate wholesale purchases and sales of energy  including losses  are a necessary component of net power supply costs 
deviation in these costs from levels included in base rates is now reflected in pca computations 
adjusted distribution of base net power supply costs base net power supply costs are distributed throughout the year based upon the monthly shape of normalized revenues for purposes of the pca deferral calculation 
fixed cost adjustment mechanism fca the fca mechanism began as a pilot program for idaho power s idaho residential and small general service customers  running from through the fca is a rate mechanism designed to remove idaho power s disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating or decoupling the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt hour charge and linking it instead to a set amount per customer 
on october   idaho power filed an application with the ipuc to make the fca mechanism permanent beginning january  the application is being processed under modified procedure 
idaho power accrued million related to the fca in  subject to ipuc approval  recovery should begin june  the ipuc approved a rate increase effective june   through may   to recover million of fixed costs under recovered during the ipuc approved a rate reduction  effective june  through may   to return million of fixed costs over recovered in langley gulch power plant ratemaking treatment on september   the ipuc issued an order providing cost recovery and ratemaking assurances related to idaho power s langley gulch project 
the ipuc found that idaho power had satisfied statutory requirements that would entitle idaho power to receive such ratemaking assurances and granted idaho power assurance and pre approval to include million of construction costs in idaho power s rate base when langley gulch achieves commercial operation 
the order contemplates that idaho power may request recovery of additional costs if they exceed million  provided that idaho power is able to demonstrate that the additional costs were reasonably and prudently incurred 
please see further discussion of the langley gulch project in liquidity and capital resources major projects langley gulch power plant 
pension expense in the idaho general rate case  the ipuc disallowed recovery of pension expense because there were no current cash contributions being made to the pension plan 
on june   the ipuc issued an order authorizing idaho power to account for its defined benefit pension expense on a cash basis 
the ipuc acknowledged that it is appropriate for idaho power to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions 
idaho power deferred approximately million  million and million of pension expense to a regulatory asset in   and respectively 
idaho power does not receive a carrying charge on the current deferral balance 
on october   idaho power filed an application with the ipuc to implement a mechanism to track and recover annually cash contributions made to the pension plan 
estimated minimum required contributions will be approximately million in  million in million in  million in  and million in in its comments  the ipuc staff recommended against establishing an annual tracking mechanism but supported allowing the inclusion in a future rate case of reasonable amortization of cash contributions 
idaho power met with the ipuc staff to clarify its understanding of their recommendation 
as a result of the meeting  idaho power filed reply comments with the ipuc stating that is was not opposed to the staff s recommendation with the clarification that the ipuc will approve amortization of future deferred cash contributions at the same time and in the same amounts as will be approved for recovery 
on february   the ipuc issued its order approving the recovery methodology agreed to by idaho power and the ipuc staff as clarified in idaho power s reply comments 
the ipuc also approved a carrying charge on the difference between actual contributions and the recovery of these amounts in rates 
idaho power recovers pension expense in its oregon jurisdiction on the accrual basis 
idaho energy efficiency rider rider idaho power s rider is the chief funding mechanism for idaho power s investment in energy efficiency  conservation  and demand response programs 
effective june   idaho power collects percent of base revenues  or approximately million annually  under the rider 
in the general rate case  idaho power requested that the ipuc explicitly find that idaho power s expenditures between and of million of funds obtained from the rider were prudently incurred and no longer subject to potential disallowance 
in  the ipuc approved a stipulation identifying million of rider funding as prudent  and on january   idaho power and the ipuc staff filed a stipulation for approval by the ipuc to find the remaining expenditures through were prudently incurred 
on october   idaho power and other investor owned electric utilities serving in idaho began a series of informal public workshop with the ipuc staff to discuss how energy efficiency evaluation and prudency will be determined on a prospective basis 
as a result a memorandum of understanding mou written by staff  idaho power and other investor owned electric utilities in idaho has been signed outlining a process for future energy expenditure approval 
this document was filed with the ipuc on january  in the first quarter of  idaho power expects to request a similar prudency determination from the ipuc for rider expenditures in and idaho power spent approximately million in and million in for rider funded energy efficiency and demand response initiatives in its idaho and oregon jurisdictions combined 
the increase in spending in reflects idaho power s growing emphasis on these programs  such as implementation of a revised irrigation peak rewards program and commercial demand response program in ferc oatt proceeding in  idaho power moved from a fixed rate to a formula rate for its open access transmission tariff oatt  which allows transmission rates to be updated each year 
the ferc accepted idaho power s new formula rates  effective june   subject to refund pending the outcome of a hearing and settlement process 
while the majority of issues related to idaho power s revised oatt filing have been resolved  idaho power is awaiting an order upon reconsideration from the ferc regarding the treatment of legacy agreements 
these agreements are contracts for transmission service that were in existence before the implementation of the oatt in the impact of ferc s ruling is being mitigated by revising certain of the legacy agreements as provided for in the agreements 
revisions are expected to increase annual transmission revenue by approximately million in compared to idaho power s oatt is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
ferc compliance program the ferc issued policy statements on enforcement in and and a policy statement on compliance in these statements encourage companies to self report to the ferc matters that constitute or may constitute violations of the federal power act fpa  the natural gas act  the natural gas policy act and the requirements of ferc rules  regulations  orders and tariffs 
the policy statements identify self reporting as a factor the ferc will consider in determining the proper remedy for a violation and emphasize the role compliance programs play in identifying and correcting violations and in evaluating whether and the extent to which penalties may be imposed 
idaho power has implemented a compliance program to ensure that its operations conform to the ferc s requirements and to provide a means of identifying  correcting and if warranted  self reporting any such matters to the ferc 
idaho power also self reports matters relating to transmission reliability standards to the wecc 
in  ferc order no 
approved mandatory reliability standards developed by the north american electric reliability corporation 
in  ferc order no 
also approved critical infrastructure protection reliability standards cip developed by the north american electric reliability corporation 
the wecc  a regional electric reliability organization  has responsibility for compliance and enforcement of these standards 
as part of its compliance program  idaho power has reported compliance issues relating to the ferc s standards of conduct and idaho power s oatt to the ferc  as well as matters relating to cip and other reliability standards to the wecc 
some of these matters have been resolved  while others are being reviewed by the ferc or the wecc 
those matters that have been resolved to date have resulted in no material impact to idaho power 
idaho power is unable to predict what action if any the ferc or the wecc will take with regard to the unresolved matters 
idaho power plans to continue its policy of using its compliance program to reduce potential violations and to self report matters to the ferc and the wecc

the rep is administered by the bonneville power administration bpa 
pursuant to agreements between the bpa and idaho power  benefits from the bpa were passed through to idaho power s residential and small farm customers through electricity bill credits 
on may   the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled that the agreements entered into between the bpa and the ious including idaho power are inconsistent with the act and shortly thereafter suspended rep payments to idaho power and the ious 
effective june   idaho power eliminated the credit on its customers bills 
subsequent bpa filings and decisions have provided no rep benefits to idaho power s customers and idaho power has filed petitions for review of these decisions with the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
idaho power has been working with the other northwest ious and consumer owned utilities  northwest state public utility commissions and the bpa to resolve these issues 
settlement efforts took place from august through november of and parties in the case have agreed to the selection of a mediator  with sessions expected to begin in the spring of since these benefits were passed through to idaho power s customers  the outcome of this matter is not expected to have an effect on idaho power s financial condition or results of operations 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects idaho power  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses last for to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
idaho power is actively pursuing the relicensing of the hells canyon complex hcc and swan falls projects 
the relicensing costs are recorded in construction work in progress until new multi year licenses are issued by the ferc  at which time the charges will be transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to new licenses will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
relicensing costs of million and million for hcc and swan falls  respectively  were included in construction work in progress at december  the ipuc authorized idaho power to include in rates approximately million annually million grossed up for income taxes of afudc relating to the hcc relicensing project 
this became effective february   and idaho power collected approximately million in collecting these amounts in current rates will reduce the relicensing amount submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
hells canyon complex the most significant ongoing relicensing effort is the hcc  which provides approximately percent of idaho power s hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and percent of its total generating nameplate capacity 
in july  idaho power filed an application for a new license in anticipation of the july expiration of the then existing license 
idaho power is currently operating under an annual license issued by the ferc and expects to continue operating under annual licenses until the new license is issued 
consistent with the requirements of the national environmental policy act of  as amended nepa  the ferc staff issued on august   a final environmental impact statement eis for the hcc  which the ferc will use to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the project 
the purpose of the final eis is to inform the ferc  federal and state agencies  native american tribes and the public about the environmental effects of idaho power s proposed operation of the hcc 
idaho power has reviewed the final eis and is developing comments for filing with the ferc 
however  certain portions of the final eis  involve issues that may be influenced by the water quality certifications for the project under section of the clean water act and formal consultations under the endangered species act esa  which remain unresolved 
idaho power anticipates filing comments to the final eis as the section and esa processes progress and the manner in which they may affect pending issues becomes certain 
in conjunction with the issuance of the final eis  on september   the ferc requested formal consultation under the esa with the national marine fisheries service nmfs and the us fish and wildlife service usfws regarding the effect of hcc relicensing on several aquatic and terrestrial species listed as threatened under the esa 
however  formal consultation has not yet been initiated and nmfs and usfws continue to gather and consider information relative to the effect of relicensing on relevant species 
idaho power continues to cooperate with the usfws  the nmfs and the ferc in an effort to address esa concerns 
because the hcc is located on the snake river where it forms the border between idaho and oregon  idaho power has filed water quality certification applications  required under section of the clean water act  with the states of idaho and oregon requesting that each state certify that any discharges from the project comply with applicable state water quality standards 
temperature and other water quality issues are of interest to various federal and state agencies  native american tribes  and other parties who may provide input to the states certification process 
section of the clean water act requires that a state either approve or deny a water quality certification application within one year of the filing of the application or the state may be considered to have waived its certification authority under the act 
as a consequence  idaho power has been filing and withdrawing its section certification applications with oregon and idaho on an annual basis while it has been working through water quality certification issues with the states 
most recently  on december   idaho power withdrew the certification applications filed with oregon and idaho  and immediately refiled the applications  in order to allow idaho power additional time to address unresolved issues associated with water quality certification for the project 
one such issue involves the temperature enhancement management program that idaho power proposed in its application and whether that program provides reasonable assurance that discharges from the hcc will adequately address fall temperature water quality criteria below hells canyon dam 
idaho power is continuing to work with idaho and oregon to ensure that any discharges from the hcc will comply with the temperature and other applicable necessary state water quality standards so that appropriate water quality certifications can be issued for the project 
the ferc is expected to issue a license order for the hcc once the esa consultation and the section certification processes are completed 
swan falls project the license for the swan falls hydroelectric project expires in june in june  idaho power filed a license application with the ferc 
on january   the ferc issued a scoping document giving notice of scheduled scoping meetings  soliciting scoping comments and of its intent to prepare an eis pursuant to the nepa 
ferc held scoping meetings on february and  on may   ferc issued scoping document for the project  advising that based on the scoping meetings and comments received that staff will prepare an eis  which the ferc will use to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new hydropower license for the project 
on june   ferc issued its notice of application ready for environmental analysis and soliciting comments  recommendations  terms and conditions  and prescriptions 
the deadline for filing comments  recommendations  terms and conditions  and prescriptions was august  filings were made by the usfws and state of idaho 
the ferc expects to complete the eis in on june   idaho power filed an application with the idaho department of environmental quality ideq for section water quality certification 
on april   the ideq issued public notice  seeking public comment on a draft section certification for the project 
no public comments were submitted and the ideq issued the section certification on may  shoshone falls expansion on august   idaho power filed a license amendment application with the ferc  which would allow idaho power to upgrade the shoshone falls project from mw to mw 
the license amendment is expected to be issued in in conjunction with the license amendment application  idaho power has filed a water rights application with the idaho department of water resources idwr 
legal matters western energy proceedings at the ferc idaho power and ie are parties to proceedings at the ferc arising from the western energy situation the california energy crisis that occurred during and  and the energy shortages  high prices and blackouts in the western united states 
high prices for electricity in california and in western wholesale markets during and caused numerous purchasers of electricity in those markets to initiate proceedings seeking refunds or other forms of relief 
the three major sets of cases arising out of the western energy situation relate to i pricing of sales in the california independent system operator cal iso and california power exchange calpx markets the california refund proceeding  ii claims of market manipulation and tariff violations in those markets  some of which have been the subject of ferc show cause orders the market manipulation cases  and iii pricing of sales in the spot power markets in the pacific northwest the pacific northwest refund proceeding 
proceedings in all three sets of cases remain pending before the ferc 
in addition  there are pending in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit ninth circuit approximately petitions for review of numerous ferc orders regarding the western energy situation  including the california refund proceeding and the market manipulation cases 
decisions in these appeals may have implications with respect to other pending cases  including those to which idaho power or ie are parties 
idaho power and ie have reached settlements with the principal parties to the california refund proceeding and the market manipulation cases  but there remain claims by parties that have not settled that represent a small minority of potential refunds in those proceedings 
idaho power and ie are unable to predict the outcome of these matters  but believe that the settlement releases they have obtained will restrict potential claims that might result from the disposition of these two sets of proceedings and that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
in the pacific northwest refund proceeding  after reviewing the ferc s decision declining to order refunds  the ninth circuit remanded the case to the ferc on april  to consider whether evidence of market manipulation would have altered the agency s conclusions about refunds and to include sales to the california department of water resources cdwr in the proceedings 
although the ferc has not yet acted on the remand from the ninth circuit  in separate filings the california parties pacific gas electric company  san diego gas electric company  southern california edison company  the california public utilities commission  the california department of water resources and the california attorney general and the city of tacoma  washington and the port of seattle  washington asked the ferc to take actions to reorganize and restructure the case so that they may pursue claims that all spot market sales in the cal iso and calpx markets and in the pacific northwest from january  through june  should be repriced  and thereby become subject to refund  because market manipulation and tariff violations affected spot market prices 
this would expand the scope of the refund period in the pacific northwest proceeding from the december  through june  period previously considered by the ferc 
in may  the california parties requested that the ferc sever the cdwr sales from the pacific northwest proceeding and consolidate the cdwr sales portion with ongoing proceedings in cases that idaho power and ie have settled  as well as with a new complaint filed on may  by the california attorney general against some sellers  but not including idaho power and ie 
in august  the city of tacoma  washington and the port of seattle  washington requested the ferc  either on a summary basis or after new evidentiary hearings  to require refunds from all sellers in the pacific northwest spot markets for the expanded period january  through june  
idaho power and ie are unable to predict the outcome of these matters or estimate the impact they may have on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
sierra club lawsuits at the bridger and boardman coal fired plants in which idaho power has ownership interests in february  the sierra club and the wyoming outdoor council filed a complaint against pacificorp in the us district court in cheyenne  wyoming  alleging violations of air quality opacity standards at the jim bridger coal fired plant in sweetwater county  wyoming 
opacity is an indication of the amount of light obscured by the flue gas of a power plant 
the complaint alleged thousands of opacity permit violations by pacificorp and sought a declaration that pacificorp had violated opacity limits  a permanent injunction ordering pacificorp to comply with such limits  civil penalties of up to  per day per violation  and reimbursement of plaintiffs costs of litigation  including reasonable attorneys fees 
idaho power is not a party to this proceeding but has a one third ownership interest in the plant 
pacificorp owns a two thirds interest in and is the operator of the plant 
on february   pacificorp and plaintiffs reached an agreement in principle to the settlement of the lawsuit in its entirety 
the settlement is subject to the approval of the environmental protection agency and the court 
if approved  the settlement will not have a material adverse effect on idaho power s consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the sierra club and four other non profit corporations filed a complaint against portland general electric company pge in the us district court for the district of oregon alleging opacity permit limit violations at the boardman coal fired plant located in morrow county  oregon 
the complaint also alleged violations of the clean air act  related federal regulations and the oregon state implementation plan relating to pge s construction and operation of the plant 
the complaint sought a declaration that pge had violated opacity limits  a permanent injunction ordering pge to comply with such limits  injunctive relief requiring pge to remediate alleged environmental damage and ongoing impacts  civil penalties of up to  per day per violation  and reimbursement of plaintiffs costs of litigation  including reasonable attorneys fees 
idaho power is not a party to this proceeding but has a percent ownership interest in the boardman plant 
pge owns percent and is the operator of the plant 
pge has stated that it cannot determine with certainty the total amount of monetary penalties and damages asserted  but based solely on the complaint  the estimated amount is million 
idaho power is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the impact it may have on its consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
snake river basin water rights idaho power is engaged in the snake river basin adjudication srba  general stream adjudication  commenced in  to define the nature and extent of water rights in the snake river basin in idaho  including the water rights of idaho power 
on march   idaho power and the state of idaho state entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the swan falls agreement and idaho power s water rights under the swan falls agreement  which settlement agreement is subject to certain conditions discussed below 
the settlement agreement will also resolve litigation between idaho power and the state relating to the swan falls agreement that was filed by idaho power on may   with the idaho district court for the fifth judicial circuit  which has jurisdiction over srba matters including the swan falls case 
the settlement agreement resolves the pending litigation by clarifying that idaho power s water rights in excess of minimum flows at its hydroelectric facilities between milner dam and swan falls dam are subordinate to future upstream beneficial uses  including aquifer recharge 
the agreement commits the state and idaho power to further discussions on important water management issues concerning the swan falls agreement and the management of water in the snake river basin 
it also recognizes that water management measures that enhance aquifer levels  springs and river flows  such as aquifer recharge projects  benefit both agricultural development and hydropower generation and deserve study to determine their economic potential  their impact on the environment and their impact on hydropower generation 
these will be a part of the comprehensive aquifer management plan camp  approved by the idaho water resource board iwrb for the eastern snake plain aquifer espa  which includes limits on the amount of aquifer recharge 
idaho power is a member of the espa camp advisory committee and implementation committee 
on april   the governor of idaho signed into law legislation approving provisions contained in the settlement agreement 
on may   as part of the settlement  idaho power  the governor of idaho and the iwrb executed a memorandum of agreement relating to future aquifer recharge efforts and further assurances as to limitations on the amount of aquifer recharge 
idaho power and the state also filed a joint motion to the srba court to dismiss the swan falls case and enter the stipulated water right decrees set forth in the settlement agreement 
parties representing groundwater users in the espa objected to some of the language proposed by idaho power and the state relating to water rights in the decrees to be entered by the srba court as contemplated by the settlement agreement 
specifically  the concerns relate to the language describing the subordination of the rights and its interplay with the original swan falls settlement document and implementing legislation 
on january   the court issued an order approving the overall settlement subject to certain modifications to the draft water right decrees proposed by the company and the state 
the company is working with the state and the parties to reach agreement consistent with the court s order regarding the language of the decrees 
idaho power has also filed an action in the us district court of federal claims in washington  dc in october  against the dc bureau of reclamation relating to a contract right for delivery of water to its hydropower projects on the snake river to recover damages from the us bureau of reclamation for the lost generation resulting from reduced flows and a prospective declaration of contractual rights so as to prevent the us bureau of reclamation from continued failure to fulfill its contractual and fiduciary duties to idaho power 
trial of the matter has not been scheduled 
idaho power is unable to predict the outcome of these matters or estimate the impact either may have on its consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
for further information regarding legal proceedings  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental issues global climate change long term climate change could significantly affect idaho power s business in a variety of ways  including the following i changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customer demand  ii extreme weather events could increase service interruptions  outages  and maintenance costs  iii changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could adversely affect hydroelectric generation  and iv legislative and or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plans and operations including placing restrictions on the construction of new generation resources  the expansion of existing resources  or the operation of generation resources in general  and v consumer preference for  and resource planning decisions requiring  renewable or low ghg emitting sources of energy could impact demand from existing sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission resources 
greenhouse gas emission reduction goals in september  idacorp s and idaho power s board of directors approved guidelines that established a goal to reduce the carbon dioxide co emission intensity of idaho power s utility operations 
idaho power s goal is to reduce its resource portfolio s average co emission intensity for the through time period to a level of to percent below idaho power s co emission intensity of  lbs co mwh 
since idaho power s co emission intensity fluctuates with stream flows and production levels of anticipated renewable resource additions  idaho power believes an average intensity reduction goal to be achieved over several years is appropriate 
generation from idaho power owned and any renewable resources under contract for which idaho power has long term rights to the renewable energy credits recs will be included in the denominator of this calculation 
idaho power s progress toward achieving this intensity reduction goal  as well as additional information on idaho power s co emissions  will be reported on idaho power s website 
the guidelines are intended to reduce idaho power s average co 

emission intensity in a manner that minimizes the costs of those reductions to idaho power s customers 
in idaho power s and ida west ranked as one of the lowest emitters of co mwh produced among the nation s largest electricity producers  according to a collaborative report from ceres  the natural resources defense council  public service enterprise group and pg e corporation using publicly reported generation and emissions data 
in may  idaho power submitted information to the carbon disclosure project cdp  an independent  not for profit organization that claims the largest database of corporate climate change information in the world 
the cdp posted responding companies information at its website in september idaho power s estimated co emission intensity lbs mwh from its generation facilities as submitted to the cdp was  and  for and  respectively 
idaho power estimates that its co emission intensity from idaho power owned generation facilities for was  lbs co mwh 
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions the american clean energy and security act of  hr  passed the hr house of representatives on june  senate environment and public works chairman barbara boxer d ca and senator john kerry d ma introduced a climate change bill on the senate floor on september  the timeline for action on the senate floor remains unclear and debate continues on the direction  scope and timing of federal legislation to reduce ghg emissions 
there are also state and regional initiatives including the western regional climate action initiative considering regional market based mechanisms to reduce ghg emissions 
oregon enacted legislation in august establishing economy wide goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
oregon s goals seek to i by  cease the growth of oregon greenhouse gas emission  ii by  reduce greenhouse gas levels to percent below levels  and iii by  reduce greenhouse gas levels to at least percent below levels 
the legislation also calls for state government developed policy recommendations in the future to assist in the monitoring and achievement of these goals 
the impact of the enacted legislation on idaho power cannot be determined at this time 
on january   portland general electric announced that it intended to pursue an alternative operating plan for its boardman power plant 
under the alternative operating plan  near term expenditures for pollution control equipment would be significantly reduced and boardman would either cease to operate in  or it would discontinue the use of coal as a fuel source 
idaho power is a ten percent owner of the plant  representing  kw of nameplate capacity 
in support of international efforts to reduce ghg emissions  in january  president obama pledged to cut ghg emissions in the united states from levels by percent by and percent by any international treaty creating mandatory ghg emission reduction requirements in the united states would need to be ratified by the us senate and implemented through legislation adopted by the us congress 
in september  the epa issued a final rule that requires monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions by a number of entities beginning on january  most facilities will be required to report annually 
electric generation facilities including idaho power s facilities already reporting co 

emissions under the clean air act caa acid rain program must report co  nitrous oxide and methane emissions to the epa on a quarterly basis 
in december  the epa issued an endangerment finding for ghg emissions from motor vehicles which has been appealed to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
the endangerment finding is required for the epa and the department of transportation national highway traffic safety administration to finalize their september proposal to adopt national ghg emission standards for motor vehicles 
on september   the epa acknowledged that the caa will require it to regulate ghg emissions from stationary sources including idaho power s thermal facilities through both its preconstruction and operating permit programs when it finalizes its proposal to adopt national ghg emission standards for motor vehicles 
under this proposed rule  epa is seeking to establish an applicability threshold of  tons of ghgs per year co 

equivalent for such programs 
idaho power will continue to monitor and evaluate any proposed international  federal  state or regional ghg legislation or initiatives as well as any judicial decisions that could affect its generating facilities 
the majority of current initiatives regarding ghg emissions contemplate market based compliance programs 
the regulation of ghg emissions under the caa could result in ghg emission limits on stationary sources that do not provide market based compliance options such as cap and trade programs or emission offsets 
such a program could raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels  specifically coal  as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities because new technologies for reducing co emissions from coal  including carbon capture storage  are still in the development stage and are not yet proven 
at this time  however  idaho power is unable to estimate the costs of compliance with any such legislation or initiatives because they are in the early stages of development and final legislation  if adopted  could vary from current proposals 
in the irp  idaho power did not include any new conventional coal resources in the resource portfolio due to the uncertainty regarding future carbon regulations 
renewable portfolio standards rps the american clean energy and security act of as passed in the us house of representatives on june   would require utilities to obtain percent of their electricity from renewable sources by  and reduce demand an additional five percent through conservation and increased energy efficiency 
the senate version would require electric utilities to meet percent of their electricity sales through renewable sources of energy or energy efficiency by resources eligible to meet these standards include wind  solar  geothermal  biomass  landfill gas  ocean  and incremental hydropower efficiency improvements or new capacity 
both bills recognize the benefits of existing hydroelectric generation by allowing utilities to subtract generation from existing hydroelectric projects from their total sales base prior to calculating the percentage requirement 
idaho power will be required to comply with a ten percent rps in oregon beginning in idaho power expects to meet these requirements with the rec s from the elkhorn valley wind project 
no rps requirement currently exists in idaho 
idaho power continues to monitor proposed federal rps legislation  which if passed could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power is currently purchasing energy from seven wind projects with a combined nameplate rating of mw 
idaho power also has an additional mw of wind generation with signed and ipuc approved contracts that have not yet been constructed  because of ipuc rules related to purpa contracts and the ipuc order for idaho power to sell some of its near term recs  idaho power does not hold the green tags or recs associated with all of these projects 
idaho power continues to pursue additional geothermal  wind  and combined heat and power chp generation resources with individual developers 
other renewable generation resources anticipated from future cspp contracts include solar  biomass  chp and additional wind projects 
for additional discussion of how idaho power is preparing for potential rps requirements  see item business utility operations resource planning 
air quality idaho power co owns three coal fired power plants and owns two natural gas combustion turbine power plants that are subject to air quality regulation 
the coal fired plants are jim bridger percent interest located in wyoming  boardman ten percent interest located in oregon  and valmy percent interest located in nevada 
the natural gas fired plants  danskin and bennett mountain  are located in idaho 
the caa establishes controls on the emissions from stationary sources like those owned by idaho power 
the epa adopts many of the standards and regulations under the caa  while states have the primary responsibility for implementation and administration of these air quality programs 
in february  a bill was introduced in the senate to impose limits on so and so emissions from power plants starting in and to require at least a percent reduction in mercury emissions from coal fired generation 
idaho power continues to actively monitor  evaluate and work on air quality issues pertaining to federal and state mercury emission rules  possible legislative amendment of the caa as discussed above  national ambient air quality standards naaqs  and regional haze best available retrofit technology rh bart and new source review nsr permitting 
mercury emissions mercury continuous emission monitoring systems have been installed on all of the coal fired units at the jim bridger  boardman and valmy plants and tests to confirm the accuracy of the data being collected are currently underway 
the epa has announced that it is developing maximum achievable control technology standards to reduce mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
in  the state of oregon adopted a mercury rule requiring boardman to reduce mercury emissions by percent or meet an emission rate of lbs trillion btu by july the state is now considering allowing up to a two year extension 
idaho power continues to monitor wyoming and nevada actions related to mercury emissions 
idaho power is unable to predict at this time what actions the epa or the other states may take to reduce mercury emissions from its coal fired power plants 
national ambient air quality standards in july  the epa adopted new naaqs for ozone hour ozone standard and fine particulate matter of less than micrometers in diameter pm standard 
regulations promulgated by the epa to implement these naaqs have been challenged and portions have been remanded back to the epa for reconsideration 
the epa and state efforts to implement the naaqs adopted in are ongoing 
all of the counties in idaho  oregon  nevada and wyoming where idaho power s power plants operate currently are designated as meeting attainment with hour ozone and pm standards adopted by the epa in in december  the epa revised the naaqs for pm this new standard was challenged by a number of groups in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and the court remanded the standard back to the epa in february all of the counties in idaho  nevada  oregon and wyoming where idaho power s power plants operate currently were designated as meeting attainment with the revised pm naaqs 
the impact of the new standard will not be known until the judicial appeals are completed and the associated regulatory programs are promulgated and implemented 
in march  the epa promulgated a final regulation which revised the hour ozone naaqs  and on january   the epa proposed to adopt a more stringent hour ozone naaqs 
idaho power is unable to predict what impact the adoption of this standard may have on its operations 
on january   the epa adopted a new naaqs for no at a level of parts per billion averaged over a hour period 
the epa has not yet designated areas as attaining or not attaining the new naaqs 
in addition  on november   the epa proposed a more stringent naaqs for so to a level between and parts per billion averaged over a hour period 
idaho power is unable to predict what impact the adoption and implementation of these standards may have on its operations 
regional haze best available retrofit technology in accordance with federal regional haze rules  coal fired utility boilers are subject to rh bart if they were built between and and affect any class i areas 
this includes all four units at the jim bridger plant and the boardman plant 
the two units at the valmy plant were constructed after and are not subject to the federal regional haze rule 
the wyoming department of environmental quality wdeq and the oregon department of environmental quality odeq are conducting an assessment of emission sources pursuant to an rh bart process 
the states are also working on reasonable progress toward a long term strategy beyond rh bart to reduce regional haze in class i areas to natural conditions by the year pacificorp submitted an rh bart application for the jim bridger plant in january on june   wdeq issued a public notice requesting comment from the public on the draft rh bart state implementation plan sip arising out of the application 
wdeq has proposed to issue an rh bart air quality permit for modification of bridger requiring installation of low nox burners with separated over fire air for no 
x 
reduction  and flue gas conditioning to enhance performance of the electrostatic precipitator particulate controls 
according to wdeq  these controls will allow bridger to meet the epa s presumptive rh bart emission limits 
the plant is already in the process of installing low nox burners and nox scrubber upgrades that are proposed in the application 
the so scrubber upgrade project has been completed on units and and is expected to be completed on the other two units by the end of idaho power expects to spend approximately million between and to complete these projects 
wdeq is further proposing to require bridger units and to be equipped with selective catalytic reduction scr nox controls before december  and december   respectively 
wdeq is requiring installation of the two scr units as part of its long term strategy in the regional haze sip 
idaho power s estimated share of the cost to install the two scrs is million 
installation of this scr pollution control equipment could require extended maintenance outages 
in addition  wdeq has proposed to require pacificorp to submit an application by january   to install add on nox controls at bridger units and by december  design and cost estimates for meeting this proposed requirement are not yet available 
the comment period on the draft rh bart sip ended on august  wdeq will finalize the sip and submit it to the epa for approval 
legal challenges or appeals of the final sip are possible 
idaho power will continue to monitor this process 
in august  the odeq issued a draft rh bart proposal for the boardman plant 
the rh bart proposal was approved by the oregon environmental quality commission in june the pollution control requirements for rh bart and the long term strategy are estimated to cost between approximately million and million idaho power share based upon current market conditions for air quality control equipment 
approximately three quarters of the costs will be incurred by with the remainder incurred by installation of this pollution control equipment could require extended maintenance outages 
on january   pge announced that it intended to pursue an alternative operating plan for its boardman plant 
under the alternative operating plan  near term expenditures for pollution control equipment would be significantly reduced and boardman would either cease to operate in  or it would discontinue the use of coal as a fuel source 
idaho power does not yet know what impact this decision will have on the odeq proposal 
while not required under rh bart  installation of low nox burners and over fired upgrades has been completed at the valmy plant 
new source review since  the epa and the us department of justice have been pursuing a national enforcement initiative focused on the compliance status of coal fired power plants with the new source review nsr permitting requirements and new source performance standards nsps of the caa 
this initiative has resulted in both enforcement litigation and significant settlements with a large number of public utilities and other owners of coal fired power plants across the country 
the administration has indicated an intention to continue this nsr enforcement initiative 
the epa sent information requests under section of the caa  requesting information relevant to nsr and nsps compliance to the jim bridger plant in  the valmy plant in and the boardman plant in with a follow up request for information in idaho power is a co owner of these plants  but does not operate the plants 
a number of utilities that have received section information requests have engaged in negotiations with the epa to address any allegations of non compliance with nsr and nsps requirements 
in some cases  such negotiations have resulted in settlements requiring the payment of civil penalties  installation of additional pollution controls  the surrender of emission allowances  and the completion of supplemental environmental projects 
idaho power cannot predict the outcome of these investigatory matters at this time 
the epa has announced its intention to propose new regulations pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act governing the management and storage of coal ash waste  and to determine whether to designate coal ash as a hazardous waste 
endangered species slickspot peppergrass this southwestern idaho plant species was listed as threatened by the u 
s 
fish and wildlife service usfws effective december while  critical habitat for the plant was not designated at the time of listing  approximately of the plant species is located on federal land owned by the bureau of land management blm and the department of defense 
parts of the gateway west and boardman to hemingway kv transmission lines and the langley gulch transmission and water lines will cross blm land 
this listing will add an additional requirement and species for consideration in the endangered species act esa section consultation 
a section consultation is a process used to determine a proposed action s effects on any esa listed species that may be within the project area 
this listing may impact the expense and timing of permitting for these projects 
sage grouse the sage grouse has been proposed for listing under the esa 
if the sage grouse is listed  this will add an additional requirement and species for consideration in esa section consultations for the gateway west and boardman to hemingway kv transmission lines and the langley gulch transmission and water lines and winter habitat may impact the expense and timing for these projects 
hells canyon project in ferc requested initiation of formal consultation under the endangered species act esa with the national marine fisheries service nmfs and the usfws regarding potential effects of hcc relicensing on several listed aquatic and terrestrial species 
formal consultation has not yet been initiated and nmfs and usfws continue to gather and consider information relative to the effects of relicensing on relevant species 
idaho power continues to cooperate with the usfws  the nmfs and the ferc in an effort to address esa concerns 
idaho power may be required to modify operations pursuant to the biological opinion that will result from formal consultation 
however  the issuance of a final biological opinion within the next to months is unlikely 
bliss and lower salmon falls projects idaho power is finalizing a snail protection plan plan in cooperation with the usfws 
if the plan is approved by the ferc  idaho power will file applications with the ferc to amend the licenses for the bliss and lower salmon falls projects that will maintain operating flexibility at both projects for the remainder of their licenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates when preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  idacorp s and idaho power s management must apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates often involve judgment about factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
management adjusts these estimates based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could materially differ from the estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
accounting for rate regulation gaap requires entities that meet specific conditions to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and requires that certain costs be deferred as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities 
idaho power must satisfy the following conditions to apply regulatory accounting an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
idaho power s has determined that it meets these conditions and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating idaho power 
the primary effect of this policy is that idaho power has recorded million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  idaho power expects to recover these regulatory assets from customers through rates and refund these regulatory liabilities to customers through rates  but recovery or refund is subject to final review by the regulatory bodies 
if future recovery or refund of these amounts ceases to be probable  or if idaho power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting  idaho power would be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities  unless regulators specify some other means of recovery or refund 
either circumstance could have a material effect on idaho power s results of operations and financial position 
asset impairment available for sale securities idaho power has investments in four mutual funds that experienced a significant decline in fair value in idaho power is required to evaluate these and other securities periodically to determine whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the cost of the investment is written down to fair value and the loss is recorded as a realized loss 
two significant factors that are considered when evaluating investments for impairment are the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost 
idaho power s investments had lost between percent and percent of their value  primarily during the stock market downturn in september and october and had been in loss positions from six to months at december  because of the severity of the declines in value  idaho power determined that the loss in value was other than temporary and recorded a pre tax loss of million in the fourth quarter of at december   the fair value of these investments was above their new cost basis and no impairment was recorded 
equity method investments ifs has affordable housing investments with a net book value of million at december   and ida west has investments in four joint ventures that own electric power generation facilities 
except for one investment which is consolidated  these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the standard for determining whether impairment must be recorded for these investments is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value 
impairment analyses on these investments were performed in and an immaterial impairment was recorded on one of the ida west joint ventures 
these estimates required idacorp to make assumptions about future stream flows  revenues  cash flows and other items that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
pension and other postretirement benefits idaho power maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most employees  an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors called the senior management security plan smsp  and a postretirement medical benefit plan 
the costs idacorp and idaho power record for these plans depend on the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics  actual returns on plan assets and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations from which the expense is derived 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends and future expectations 
estimates of future stock market performance  changes in interest rates and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
the assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high quality corporate debt 
specifically  idacorp and idaho power utilize data published in the citigroup pension liability index and apply the rates therein against the projected cash outflows of the plans 
the discount rate used to calculate the pension expense will be decreased to percent from the percent used in rate of return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk return relationships among asset classes 
the primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the return on year us treasury notes 
this historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on year us treasury notes  and the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance 
additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns  as well as worst case and best case scenarios 
based on the current interest rate environment  current rate of return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past years when interest rates were generally much higher 
gross pension and other postretirement benefit expense for these plans totaled million  million  and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor and amounts deferred as regulatory assets 
for  gross pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to total approximately million  which takes into account the change in the discount rate noted above  as well as a decrease in expected return on plan assets 
no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
had different actuarial assumptions been used  pension expense could have varied significantly 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension and postretirement expense discount rate rate of return millions of dollars effect of increase effect of decrease no cash contributions were required or made to the qualified plan in or a million contribution for is due in calendar year  and estimated payments of million  million  million  and million are due in    and  respectively 
under the smsp  idaho power makes payments directly to participants in the plan 
benefit payments are expected to be million in and averaged million per year from to gross postretirement plan contributions are expected to be million in  and averaged million from to the ipuc has authorized idaho power to account for its defined benefit pension expense on a cash basis  and to defer and account for accrued pension expense as a regulatory asset 
the ipuc acknowledged that it is appropriate for idaho power to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions 
idaho power began deferring pension expense to a regulatory asset account to be matched with revenue when future pension contributions are recovered through rates 
the deferral of pension expense began in at december   million of expense was deferred as a regulatory asset 
approximately million is expected to be deferred in please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information about the pension and postretirement plans 
contingent liabilities an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if a it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency in the notes to the financial statements is required 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
idacorp and idaho power have a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory and legal matters 
if the recognition criteria have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements 
income taxes idacorp and idaho power use judgment and estimation in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax related assets and liabilities 
the interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty  since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income  cash flows  and tax related assets and liabilities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
inflation idacorp and idaho power believe that inflation has caused and may continue to cause increases in certain operating expenses and the replacement of assets at higher costs 
inflation affects the cost of labor  products and services required for operations and maintenance and capital expenditures 
while inflation has not had a significant impact on idacorp s or idaho power s operations  increases in utility expenses due to inflation could have an adverse effect on earnings because of the need to obtain regulatory approval to recover such increased expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and idaho power are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in commodity prices  credit risk and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and idaho power manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
variable rate debt as of december   idacorp and idaho power had million and million  respectively  in floating rate debt net of temporary cash investments 
assuming no change in financial structure for either company  if variable interest rates were one percentage point higher than the rates in effect on december   interest rate expense would increase and pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million for idacorp and million for idaho power 
fixed rate debt as of december   idacorp and idaho power each had billion in fixed rate debt  with a fair market value also equal to billion 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose the companies to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million for both idacorp and idaho power if interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their december  levels 
commodity price risk utility idaho power s exposure to changes in commodity price is related to its ongoing utility operations producing electricity to meet the demand of its retail electric customers 
the weather is a major uncontrollable factor affecting the local and regional demand for electricity and the availability and cost of production 
the objective of idaho power s energy purchase and sale activity is to meet the demand of retail electric customers  maintain appropriate physical reserves to ensure reliability  and make economic use of temporary surpluses that may develop 
idaho power s exposure to commodity price risk is largely offset by the previously discussed power cost adjustment mechanisms in idaho and oregon 
idaho power has adopted a risk management program designed to reduce exposure to power supply cost related uncertainty  further mitigating commodity price risk 
this program has been reviewed and accepted by the ipuc 
idaho power s energy risk management policy the policy describes a collaborative process with customers and regulators via a committee called the customer advisory group cag 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of selected idaho power officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
the rmc is responsible for communicating the status of risk management activities to the idaho power board of directors  and to the cag 
the policy requires monitoring monthly volumetric electricity position and total monthly dollar net power supply cost exposure on a rolling month forward view 
the power supply business unit produces and evaluates projections of the operating plan and orders risk mitigating actions dictated by the limits stated in the policy 
the rmc evaluates the actions initiated by power supply for consistency and compliance with the policy 
idaho power representatives meet with the cag at least annually to assess effectiveness of the limits 
changes to the limits can be endorsed by the cag and referred to the board of directors for approval 
the primary tools for risk mitigation are physical and financial forward power transactions and fueling alternatives for utility owned generation resources 
credit risk utility idaho power is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
idaho power is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy or complete financial settlement for market activities 
idaho power mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  reporting  using appropriate contractual arrangements and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash or letters of credit 
a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits is maintained 
the use of performance assurance collateral in the form of cash  letters of credit  or guarantees is common industry practice 
idaho power maintains margin agreements that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested and or posted with certain counterparties 
as of december   idaho power had posted approximately million of assurance collateral 
should idaho power experience a reduction in its credit rating on idaho power s unsecured debt to below investment grade  idaho power could be subject to additional requests by its wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral 
counterparties to derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate ongoing full daily collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions 
based upon idaho power s current energy and fuel portfolio and current market conditions as of december   the approximate amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a downgrade is approximately million 
idaho power actively monitors the portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral calls  through sensitivity analysis  to minimize capital requirements 
credit risk for idaho power s retail customers is managed by credit and collection policies that are governed by rules issued by the ipuc 
idaho power is obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its service area 
idaho power records a provision for uncollectible accounts  based upon historical experience  to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers 
idaho power will continue to monitor the impact of the current economic conditions on nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to its provision for uncollectible accounts 
idaho administrative code for utility customer relations rules prohibits idaho power from terminating electric service during the months of december through february to any residential customer who declares that he or she is unable to pay in full for utility service and whose household includes children  elderly or infirm persons 
idaho power s provision for uncollectible accounts could be affected by changes in future prices as well as changes in ipuc regulations 
equity price risk idacorp and idaho power are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of idaho power and other equity investments at idaho power 
as a result of market increases in  the fair value of the pension plan s assets increased  however  increases in the benefit obligation were greater than the increases in the pension plan s assets  therefore resulting in an increase in future amounts required to be contributed to the plan 
based on current laws  idaho power estimates that the minimum contribution to idaho power s pension plan in will be million 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities
