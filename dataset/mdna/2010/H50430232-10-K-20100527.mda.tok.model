the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth above in item a risk factors  and below in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview of our company logitech is a world leader in personal peripherals for computers and other digital platforms 
we develop and market innovative products in pc navigation  internet communications  digital music  home entertainment control  gaming and wireless devices 
with our acquisition of lifesize communications  inc in december  we entered the market for enterprise video conferencing products and services 
our products combine essential core technologies  continuing innovation  and award winning industrial design 
logitech operates in two industry segments  personal peripherals and video conferencing 
our personal peripherals segment encompasses the design  manufacturing and marketing of personal peripherals for personal computers and other digital platforms 
our research and product management teams are organized along product lines  and are responsible for product strategy  industrial design and development  and technological innovation 
our global marketing and sales organization helps define product opportunities and bring our products to market  and is responsible for building the logitech brand and consumer awareness of our products 
this organization is comprised of retail and oem original equipment manufacturer sales and marketing groups 
our retail sales and marketing activities are organized into three geographic regions americas including north and south america  europe middle east africa emea  and asia pacific 
our oem sales team is a worldwide organization with representatives in each of our three regions 
our oem customers include the majority of the world s largest pc manufacturers 
our video conferencing segment encompasses the design  manufacturing and marketing of lifesize video conferencing products and services for the enterprise and small to medium business markets 
the lifesize segment maintains a separate marketing and sales organizations 
the lifesize product development and product management organizations are separate  but coordinated with our personal peripherals business  particularly our webcam and video communications groups 
based on the financial measurements for the fiscal year ended march  as evaluated by logitech s chief executive officer  the lifesize operating segment does not meet the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure of financial information required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
for the pc  our products include mice  trackballs  keyboards  interactive gaming controllers  multimedia speakers  headsets  webcams  d control devices and lapdesks 
our internet communications products include webcams  headsets  video communications services  and digital video security systems for a home or small business 
our lifesize division offers scalable high definition hd video communication products  support and services 
our digital music products include speakers  earphones  and custom in ear monitors 
for home entertainment systems  we offer the harmony line of advanced remote controls and the squeezebox and transporter wireless music solutions for the home 
for gaming consoles  we offer a range of gaming controllers  including racing wheels  wireless guitar and drum controllers  and microphones  as well as other accessories 
we sell our peripheral products to a network of retail distributors and resellers and to oems 
our worldwide retail network for our peripherals includes wholesale distributors  consumer electronics retailers  mass merchandisers  specialty electronics stores  computer and telecommunications stores  value added resellers and online merchants 
our sales to our retail channels for our peripherals were and of our net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and the large majority of our revenues have historically been derived from sales of our personal peripheral products for use by consumers 
we sell our lifesize products and services to distributors  value added resellers  oems and direct enterprise customers 
the large majority of lifesize revenues have historically been derived from sales to large enterprises  small to medium businesses  and public healthcare  education and government organizations 
our markets are extremely competitive 
the personal peripherals market is characterized by short product life cycles  frequent new product introductions  rapidly changing technology  evolving customer demands  and aggressive promotional and pricing practices 
we believe that the global economic downturn has further increased competition in our markets  as competitors with larger financial resources  such as microsoft corporation  sony corporation and others  seek to gain market share by discounting prices or offering more favorable terms to customers  and competitors with smaller financial resources also discount prices or engage in other promotional practices in order to maintain their market share 
the video conferencing market is characterized by continual performance enhancements and increasing consolidation 
there is heightened interest in the video conferencing market by large  well financed competitors  such as cisco systems  inc and hewlett packard company  and as a result  we expect competition in the market to further intensify 
we believe continued investment in product research and development is critical to creating the innovation required to strengthen our competitive advantage and to drive future sales growth 
we are committed to identifying and meeting current and future customer trends with new and improved product technologies  as well as leveraging the value of the logitech brand from a competitive  channel partner and consumer experience perspective 
we believe innovation and product quality are important to gaining market acceptance and maintaining market leadership 
the broadening of our product lines has been primarily organic 
however we also seek to acquire  when appropriate  companies that have products  personnel  and technologies that complement our strategic direction 
as access to digital information expands beyond the pc platform  we are also extending our vision to other platforms  such as the living room  meeting room and other platforms as access points to the internet and the digital world 
for example  with our acquisition of lifesize in december  we entered the video conferencing market 
together  logitech and lifesize plan to pursue existing and new relationships with unified communications  collaboration and voice over internet protocol voip industry partners and competitors to drive the development of an open eco system for interoperable video communications 
in addition  as part of our corporate strategy  we plan to increase investments in and realign resources to focus on certain market adjacencies  geographic markets or new categories  including video communications and the china market 
we also plan to increase our investment in applications and peripherals for open platforms  which do not require direct collaboration and agreement with the platform owner 
we continually evaluate our product offerings and our strategic direction in light of current global economic conditions  changing consumer trends  and the evolving nature of the interface between the consumer and the digital world 
summary of financial results our total net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased compared with the fiscal year ended march  net sales in the second half of fiscal year increased over the same period in  after decreasing in the first six months of the year 
while not yet resuming the sales levels in fiscal year  the improvement in net sales in the last six months of fiscal year reflects more stable global economic conditions 
retail sales in fiscal year decreased compared with retail unit sales decreased  less than the decrease in sales dollars  reflecting the shift by consumers towards value priced products as a result of the economic downturn 
retail sales in our asia pacific and emea regions decreased and in fiscal year compared with fiscal year retail sales in our americas region increased in the same period 
retail sales in the last six months of fiscal year increased in the emea and americas region  and decreased slightly in the asia pacific region  indicating an improvement in the sales trend 
oem sales decreased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year oem units sold decreased in the same period 
the substantial decline in oem sales was related to console microphones  which sold well in the prior fiscal year  but have reached the latter stages of the typical gaming sales cycle in fiscal year the sales of lifesize communications  inc  which we acquired on december   are included in our financial results from the date of acquisition to the end of the fiscal year 
our gross margin for fiscal year was compared with in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the impact of operational efficiencies across our supply chain and a favorable shift in product mix towards products with higher margins 
net income for the year ended march  was million  compared with net income of million in fiscal year the decline in net income in resulted primarily from the decline in net sales 
net income also included the negative impact of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year of costs related to the restructuring plan initiated in january in response to deteriorating global economic conditions 
trends in our business we have a large and varied portfolio of product lines for personal peripherals  grouped in several product families 
in addition to changes resulting from general economic trends  we believe that normal increases or decreases in the retail sales level of a product family reflect the innovation we have designed into the product  customer acceptance of the product line  the popularity of the digital platforms the product line relates to  competitive activity in the product family  and the prices at which products are available 
historically  sales of individual product lines rise and fall over time  causing our overall product mix to shift both between and within product lines  and we expect these types of trends to continue 
we have historically targeted peripherals for the pc platform  a market that is dynamically changing as a result of the declining popularity of desktop pcs and the increasing popularity of notebook pcs and mobile devices  such as netbooks  smartphones  tablets and smaller form factor devices with computing or web surfing capabilities 
in our retail channels  notebook pcs and mobile devices are sold by retailers without peripherals 
we believe this creates opportunities to sell products to consumers to help make their devices more productive and comfortable 
however  consumer acceptance and demand for peripherals for use with smaller form factor computing devices such as notebook pcs and mobile devices is still uncertain 
the increasing popularity of notebook pcs and mobile devices may result in decreased demand by consumers for personal peripherals  which could negatively affect our business 
the increasing popularity of mobile devices has coincided with a steadily decreasing average sales price for computing devices  including for desktop and notebook pcs 
as a result  there is a risk that the demand for those of our products that have a relatively high average sales price in relation to the price of a desktop or notebook pc will decline 
we believe our future sales growth will be significantly affected by our ability to develop sales and innovations in our current products for notebook pcs and other mobile devices  as well as for emerging product categories which are not pc dependent 
in our oem channel  the shift away from desktop pcs has adversely affected our sales of oem mice  which are sold with name brand desktop pcs 
our oem mice sales have historically made up the bulk of our oem sales 
our oem sales accounted for and of total revenues during fiscal years and we expect the trend of slowing oem mice sales to continue 
most of our revenue comes from sales to our retail channels  which resell to consumers and other retailers 
as a result  our customers demand for our products depends in substantial part on trends in consumer confidence and consumer spending  as well as the levels of inventory which our customers choose to maintain 
we use sell through data  which represents sales of our products by our retailer customers to consumers and by our distributor customers to retailers  along with other metrics to indicate consumer demand for our products 
sell through data is subject to limitations due to collection methods and the third party nature of the data and thus may not be an entirely accurate indicator of actual consumer demand for our products 
in addition  the customers supplying sell through data vary by geographic region and from period to period  but typically represent a majority of our retail sales 
the acquisition of lifesize in december expands our video communication product portfolio beyond webcams and video calling into the enterprise meeting room 
we believe our video conferencing segment offers significant growth opportunities for our business 
however  the segment currently represents a small part of our net sales and will require continuing investments in product development and sales and marketing 
we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions to enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas  our technologies and our product offerings 
we also intend to continue to invest in video communications  in products for the digital home  and in growing our sales in china by increasing hiring in related engineering and sales and marketing functions 
although our financial results are reported in us dollars  approximately half of our sales are made in currencies other than the us dollar  such as the euro  british pound  japanese yen  chinese renminbi and canadian dollar 
our product costs are primarily in us dollars and chinese renminbi 
our operating expenses are incurred in us dollars  euros  chinese renminbi  swiss francs  taiwanese dollars  and  to a lesser extent  other currencies 
to the extent that the us dollar significantly increases or decreases in value relative to the currencies in which our sales and operating expenses are denominated  the reported dollar amounts of our sales and expenses may decrease or increase 
in fiscal year the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income was not material 
our gross margins vary with the mix of products sold  competitive activity  product life cycle  new product introductions  unit volumes  commodity and supply chain costs  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  geographic sales mix  and the complexity and functionality of new product introductions 
changes in consumer demand affect the need for us to undertake promotional efforts  such as cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs or price protection  which alters our product gross margins 
gross margins for the fiscal year ended march  were  compared with in fiscal year  primarily due to the impact of operational efficiencies across our supply chain and a favorable shift in product mix towards products with higher margins 
we currently anticipate our gross margins to be higher in fiscal year compared with fiscal year logitech is incorporated in switzerland but operates in various countries with differing tax laws and rates 
a portion of our income before taxes and the provision for income taxes are generated outside of switzerland 
therefore  our effective income tax rate depends on the amount of profits generated in each of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
for fiscal years and  the income tax provision was million and million based on effective income tax rates of and 
the change in effective income tax rate between fiscal years and is primarily due to the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which the company operates 
we expect future effective income tax rates to fluctuate for similar reasons 
in the fiscal quarter ended march   we implemented a restructuring plan which included a reduction in logitech s salaried workforce and other actions aimed at reducing operating expenses 
we incurred million in pre tax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and million in the twelve months ended march  related to employee termination costs  contract termination costs and other associated costs 
the restructuring plan was expected to generate annual personnel cost savings beginning in fiscal year of approximately million  and approximately million additional variable cost savings through efforts to limit production costs and operating expenses 
the cost savings realized from the restructuring are partially offset in the operating results of fiscal year by the addition of lifesize s operating expenses and by increased spending to support the return to revenue growth 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap requires the company to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate critical if it i requires management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  and ii is important to an understanding of logitech s financial condition and operating results 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to our business operations and to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for customer programs we record accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and pricing programs 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued in the period the company sells the product or commits to the program as a reduction of revenue or as an operating expense  if we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
returns 
the company grants limited rights to return product 
return rights vary by customer  and range from just the right to return defective product to stock rotation rights to return a limited percentage of the previous quarter s purchases 
estimates of expected future product returns are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical return trends by customer and by product  inventories owned by and located at distributors and retailers  current customer demand  current operating conditions  and other relevant customer and product information  such as stage of product life cycle 
return trends are influenced by the timing of the sale  the type of customer  operational policies and procedures  product sell through  product quality issues  sales levels  market acceptance of products  competitive pressures  new product introductions  product life cycle status  and other factors 
return rates can fluctuate over time  but are sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns 
cooperative marketing arrangements 
the company s cooperative marketing arrangements include contractual customer marketing and sales incentive programs 
we enter into customer marketing programs with many of our distribution and retail customers allowing customers to receive a credit equal to a set percentage of their purchases of the company s products  or a fixed dollar credit for various marketing programs 
the objective of these programs is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for the estimated costs of these marketing programs are recorded based on the contractual percentage of product purchased in the period we recognize revenue 
the company also offers rebates and discounts for certain types of sell through programs 
accruals for these sales incentive programs are recorded at the time of sale  or time of commitment  based on negotiated terms  historical experience and inventory levels in the channel 
customer incentive programs 
customer incentive programs include volume and consumer rebates 
we offer volume rebates to our distribution and retail customers related to purchase volumes or sales of specific products by distributors to specified retailers 
reserves for volume rebates are recognized as a reduction of the sale price at the time of sale 
estimates of required reserves are determined based on negotiated terms  consideration of historical experience  anticipated volume of future purchases  and inventory levels in the channel 
consumer rebates are offered from time to time at the company s discretion directly to end users 
estimated costs of consumer rebates and similar incentives are recorded at the time the incentive is offered  based on the specific terms and conditions 
certain incentive programs  including consumer rebates  require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular programs 
price protection and special pricing 
we have contractual agreements with certain of our customers that contain terms allowing price protection credits to be issued in the event of a subsequent price reduction contractual price protection 
at management s discretion  we also offer special pricing discounts to certain customers 
special pricing discounts are usually offered only for limited time periods or for sales to specific indirect partners 
our decision to make price reductions is influenced by channel inventory levels  product life cycle stage  market acceptance of products  the competitive environment  new product introductions and other factors 
credits are issued for units that customers have on hand or in transit at the date of the price reduction 
reserves for the estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers are established quarterly based on planned price reductions  analyses of qualified inventories on hand with distributors and retailers and historical trends by customer and by product 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and pricing programs 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to take action to increase such programs 
in addition  when the variables used to estimate these costs change  or if actual costs differ significantly from the estimates  we would be required to record incremental reductions to revenue or increase operating expenses 
if  at any future time  the company becomes unable to reasonably estimate these costs  recognition of revenue might be deferred until products are sold to end users  which would adversely impact revenue in the period of transition 
investment securities our investment securities portfolio as of march  and consisted of auction rate securities collateralized by residential and commercial mortgages 
the estimated fair value of our investment securities was million and million at march  and estimated fair value was determined by estimating values of the underlying collateral using analogous published indices or by estimating future cash flows  either through discounted cash flow or option pricing methods  incorporating assumptions of default and other future conditions 
the investments are classified as available for sale  and were reclassified from current to non current assets as of april   as sale or realization of proceeds from sale is not expected within our normal operating cycle of one year 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products through a worldwide network of distributors  retailers and oem customers 
logitech generally does not require any collateral from its customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances are based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as the company s historical experience with bad debts and customer deductions  receivables aging  current economic trends and geographic or country specific risks and the financial condition of our distribution channel 
if management determines that a customer s accounts receivable balance is uncollectible  recognition of revenue from that customer is deferred until collectibility is reasonably assured 
as of march   one customer represented of total accounts receivable 
the customers comprising the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivable as of march  a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
if any of these customers receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible or if actual write offs are higher than historical experience  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could result in an increase in the company s operating expenses 
inventory valuation the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of customer orders 
further  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value and record write downs of inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand or market value 
a review of inventory is performed each fiscal quarter that considers factors including the marketability and product life cycle stage  product development plans  component cost trends  demand forecasts and current sales levels 
we identify inventory exposures by comparing inventory on hand  in the channel and on order to historical and forecasted sales over six month periods 
inventory on hand which is not expected to be sold or utilized based on review of forecasted sales and utilization is considered excess  and we recognize the write off in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
at the time of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances would not result in an increase in the cost basis 
if there were an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for logitech s products or an unanticipated change in technological or customer requirements  we may be required to record additional write downs which could adversely affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded 
share based compensation expense share based compensation expense includes compensation expense  reduced for estimated forfeitures  for awards granted after april  based on the grant date fair value 
the grant date fair value for stock options and stock purchase rights is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock units rsus which vest upon meeting certain market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo simulation method 
the grant date fair value of time based rsus is calculated based on the share market price on the date of grant 
for stock options and restricted stock assumed by logitech when lifesize was acquired  the grant date used to estimate fair value is deemed to be december   the date of acquisition 
compensation expense for awards granted or assumed after april  is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of the award 
for share based compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   share based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model reduced for estimated forfeitures  and recognized on a straight line basis over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
see note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based compensation 
our estimates of share based compensation expense require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures  dividend yield  related tax effects and the selection of an appropriate fair value model 
we estimate expected share price volatility based on historical volatility using daily prices over the term of past options  rsus or purchase offerings  as we consider historical share price volatility as most representative of future volatility 
we estimate expected life based on historical settlement rates  which we believe are most representative of future exercise and post vesting termination behaviors 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures  and we record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and future expectations of dividend payouts 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation expense and related tax effects represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future from what we have recorded in the current period  which could materially affect our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes logitech operates in multiple jurisdictions and its profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions 
the company s effective income tax rate may be affected by the changes in or interpretations of tax laws in any given jurisdiction  utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  changes in geographical mix of income and expense  and changes in management s assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
as a result of these considerations  we must estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  considering all available evidence such as historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
we make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax law  the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters surrounding the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits 
in the event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates  or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes  we will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur 
such adjustments may have a material impact on our income tax provision and our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as investments  property  plant and equipment  and goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could require us to review an asset for impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability of investments  property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets is measured by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate with its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from our estimated future cash flows 
recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired  and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
we continue to maintain discrete financial information for dconnexion and lifesize  and accordingly determine impairment for the goodwill acquired with these acquisitions at the entity level 
all other acquired goodwill is evaluated for impairment at a total enterprise level 
in determining fair value  we consider various factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods over which our assets will be utilized  and other variables 
we calculate the company s fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate to the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill 
logitech bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb published accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit 
this guidance amends the criteria in asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  based on vendor specific objective evidence  acceptable third party evidence  or estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  the disclosures required for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements are expanded 
asu is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the appropriate timing for the adoption of asu and its potential impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in october  the fasb published asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  to provide guidance for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
under this guidance  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality are excluded from the software revenue guidance in accounting standards codification asc subtopic  software revenue recognition 
in addition  hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are always excluded from the software revenue guidance 
asu is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the appropriate timing for the adoption of asu and its potential impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in january  the fasb published asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurement  which requires additional disclosures regarding the activity in fair value measurements classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
disclosure of activity in level fair value measurements is required for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we will provide these disclosures beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  when such activity occurs 
in april  the fasb published asu  effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades 
the asu provides that a share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity shares trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity 
the asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is permitted 
our adoption of asu in the first quarter of fiscal year will not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net sales net sales by channel for fiscal years  and were as follows in thousands change year ended march  vs vs net sales by channel retail    oem    lifesize  total net sales    the decreases in retail sales in fiscal years and reflected the global economic downturn 
the impact began in the third quarter of fiscal year and continued through the second quarter of fiscal year during this period  our retail sales were affected by consumers reluctance to spend  their buying preference for lower price products and their strong response to promotions  as well as our customers alignment of inventory levels with the declining consumer demand 
sales of products priced below represented of retail sales in fiscal year  compared with in fiscal year and in fiscal year retail units decreased in fiscal year  compared with a decrease in  indicating the beginnings of economic stabilization 
foreign currency exchange rates did not affect the retail sales decline 
the significant decline in oem sales for fiscal year compared with was attributable to the popularity of our console microphones in fiscal year and the first three quarters of fiscal year these products reached the latter stages of the typical gaming sales cycle in the fourth quarter of fiscal year oem units sold decreased during fiscal year and increased in fiscal year  compared with the prior fiscal years 
foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly affect the oem sales decline 
lifesize net sales represent sales of video conferencing units and related software and services for the period from december   the date of acquisition  to the end of the fiscal year 
although we consider lifesize a separate operating segment  based on financial measurements for the fiscal year ended march  and our near term expectations  the lifesize segment does not meet the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure of financial information required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
approximately  and of the company s total net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in fiscal years  and if foreign currency exchange rates had been the same in fiscal years and  our constant dollar sales decline would have been 
if foreign currency exchange rates had been the same in fiscal years and  our constant dollar sales decrease would have been 
we refer to our net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates as constant dollar sales 
constant dollar sales are a non gaap financial measure  which is information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
our management uses these non gaap measures in its financial and operational decision making  and believes these non gaap measures  when considered in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures  facilitate a better understanding of changes in net sales 
constant dollar sales are calculated by translating prior period sales in each local currency at the current period s average exchange rate for that currency 
retail sales by region the following table presents the change in retail sales by region for fiscal year compared with fiscal year  and fiscal year compared with fiscal year year ended march  vs vs change in retail sales by region emea americas asia pacific total retail sales sales in the emea region decreased in all product families except audio in fiscal year compared with  reflecting the effects of the global economic downturn 
for the same reason in fiscal year  the emea region experienced sales decreases in all product families compared with the prior year 
retail units sold declined and in fiscal years and compared with the prior year 
in both fiscal years and  sales in eastern europe and other emerging markets were depressed  reflecting the economic downturn  customers lack of available credit to finance purchases of inventory  and currency volatility 
the percentage decline in retail sell through in the emea region for fiscal year was less than the decline in sell in  which indicates comparatively stronger consumer demand for our products than our sales results reflected  as well as a continuance of the realignment of our channel partners weeks of supply levels

the improvement in the gross margin percentage in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to operational efficiencies across our supply chain  including lower product costs as well as faster inventory turnover  and a favorable shift in product mix towards products with higher margins 
gross profit in fiscal year decreased in dollars and declined as a percentage of revenue compared with fiscal year primarily due to the decline in net sales  an increasingly promotional environment  the mix of products sold  and higher freight and intangible amortization costs

we expect to limit future growth in operating expenses below the growth rate in revenues  restraining or reducing non critical expenses while investing in activities that will sustain and drive revenue growth 
we refer to our operating expenses excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates as constant dollar operating expenses 
constant dollar operating expenses are a non gaap financial measure  which is information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
our management uses these non gaap measures in its financial and operational decision making  and believes these non gaap measures  when considered in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures  facilitate a better understanding of changes in operating expenses 
constant dollar operating expenses are calculated by translating prior period operating expenses in each local currency at the current period s average exchange rate for that currency 
marketing and selling marketing and selling expense consists of personnel and related overhead costs  corporate and product marketing  promotions  advertising  trade shows  customer and technical support and facilities costs 
the decline in marketing and selling expenses in fiscal year compared with fiscal year resulted primarily from lower spending in marketing development funds  travel expenses and consulting fees 
the decrease in spending between fiscal years and was the result of lower spending in advertising  marketing development funds  and travel expenses 
these decreases in marketing costs related to the alignment of promotional expenditures with current sales levels and targeted product promotion activities which occurred in fiscal year personnel costs increased in fiscal years and over the preceding fiscal years partially due to the addition of lifesize sales and marketing personnel in fiscal year and the wilife product marketing group in fiscal year  and partially relating to the comparison of periods in which discretionary personnel costs were reduced 
bad debt expense declined significantly in fiscal year as economic conditions stabilized  after increasing significantly in fiscal year as a result of customers financial difficulties related to the economic downturn 
if foreign currency exchange rates had been the same in fiscal years and  the percentage decrease in constant dollar marketing and selling expense for fiscal year would not have changed 
the impact of year over year exchange rate changes on translation of foreign currency marketing and selling expenses to our us dollar financial statements was not material in fiscal year compared with fiscal year research and development research and development expense consists of personnel and related overhead costs  contractors and outside consultants  supplies and materials  equipment depreciation and facilities costs  all associated with the design and development of new products and enhancements of existing products 
the increases in research and development expenses in fiscal years and resulted from the addition of research and development costs of companies acquired in fiscal years  and personnel costs were approximately the same in fiscal years and  but increased in fiscal year in comparison with fiscal year  when discretionary personnel costs were reduced 
if foreign currency exchange rates had been the same in fiscal years and  the change in constant dollar research and development expense would have been  the same as the change in us dollars 
in fiscal year  exchange rate changes  particularly from the stronger swiss franc and taiwanese dollar relative to the us dollar  contributed to the increase in research and development expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related overhead and facilities costs for the finance  information systems  executive  human resources and legal functions 
general and administrative expense was approximately the same in fiscal years and  and declined in fiscal year the decline in fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease of in personnel costs  as headcount was reduced  although the headcount reduction was offset by the addition of lifesize personnel in the fourth fiscal quarter 
personnel costs increased during fiscal year primarily due to an increase in share based compensation expense 
decreases in travel and infrastructure expenses in fiscal year were partially offset by million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of lifesize 
consulting fees and travel expenses decreased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year as a result of cost containment efforts 
if foreign currency exchange rates had been the same in fiscal years and  the percentage decrease in constant dollar general and administrative expense for fiscal year would have been 
exchange rate changes  particularly from the stronger swiss franc relative to the us dollar  contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal year restructuring charges restructuring charges consist of termination benefits  asset impairment charges  contract termination costs and other charges associated with the restructuring plan initiated in january in the period from january to march   we incurred pre tax restructuring charges of million 
the restructuring plan reduced our salaried workforce by approximately employees  resulting in million in termination benefits to those employees 
termination benefits were calculated based on regional benefit practices and local statutory requirements 
an additional million in pension plan curtailment and settlement costs were incurred in fiscal year as a result of the terminations 
restructuring charges also included exit costs associated with the closure of existing facilities and write downs of fixed assets that were not placed in service due to the abandonment of the related projects 
the restructuring was completed as of march  the cost savings realized from the restructuring are partially offset in the operating results of fiscal year by the addition of lifesize s operating expenses and by increased spending to support the return to revenue growth

the higher foreign exchange gains during fiscal year were due to gains on sales of euros for us dollars 
the gains on currency sales in fiscal year were offset by losses on foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce the short term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency receivables or payables 
we do not speculate in currency positions  but we are alert to opportunities to maximize foreign exchange gains 
we recorded write downs of million  million and million in fiscal years  and related to other than temporary declines in the estimated fair value of our investment securities 
during fiscal year  we also recorded a realized gain of million on investments sold as part of a confidential settlement agreement  and a realized loss of million on the sale of investments collateralized by corporate debt

logitech operates in multiple jurisdictions and its profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions 
the company s effective income tax rate may be affected by the changes in or interpretations of tax laws in any given jurisdiction  utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  changes in geographical mix of income and expense  and change in management s assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax 
the increase in the effective income tax rate to compared with in fiscal year is due to the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
the increase in the effective income tax rate to in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year is primarily due to the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the decrease in income before income taxes 
the us federal research tax credit expired as of december  the us house of representatives in december and the us senate in march passed different draft legislation which would extend the tax credit for an additional year  however the extension has not yet passed into law as of march  accordingly  our income tax provision for fiscal year includes a tax benefit for the federal research tax credit of million calculated through december the us state of california has enacted legislation affecting the methodology which must be used by corporate taxpayers to apportion income to california 
these changes will become effective for our fiscal year ending march  although the company has significant operations in california  we believe these changes will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources cash balances  available borrowings  and capital resources at march   our working capital was million  compared with million at march  the decrease in working capital over the prior year was due to the cash paid for the acquisition of lifesize  offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities

we used million in investing activities  including million for the acquisition of lifesize  net of cash acquired of million  million for certain assets of tv compass  and million for investments in tooling  computer hardware  and software 
net cash used in financing activities was million  primarily for the repurchase of shares under our share buyback programs and the repayment of short and long term debt assumed in the lifesize acquisition  partially offset by proceeds from employee stock purchases and the exercise of stock options 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  comprised of bank demand deposits and short term time deposits 
cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost  which is equivalent to fair value 
in addition  we hold investments consisting of auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of million  which are carried in non current assets  as sale or realization of proceeds from the sale of these securities is not expected within our normal operating cycle of one year 
the fair value of these securities at march  was determined by estimating future cash flows  either through discounted cash flow or option pricing methods  incorporating assumptions of default and other future conditions 
during fiscal year  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to the other than temporary decline in the fair value of these securities 
further changes in the fair value of our investment securities would not materially affect our liquidity or capital resources 
the company has credit lines with several european and asian banks totaling million as of march  as is common for businesses in european and asian countries  these credit lines are uncommitted and unsecured 
despite the lack of formal commitments from the banks  we believe that these lines of credit will continue to be made available because of our long standing relationships with these banks and our current financial condition 
at march   there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit 
there are no financial covenants under these facilities 
we provide various third parties with irrevocable letters of credit in the normal course of business to secure our obligations to pay or perform pursuant to the requirements of an underlying agreement or the provision of goods and services

during fiscal year  the company s operating activities generated net cash of million  compared with million in and million in the increase in was due primarily to targeted management of working capital  reflected in the lower dso and higher ito 
dso for fiscal year improved by days compared with fiscal year and days over fiscal year  due to improved cash collections and increased order and shipment linearity 
typical payment terms require customers to pay for product sales generally within to days  however  terms may vary by customer type  by country and by selling season 
extended payment terms are sometimes offered to a limited number of customers during the second and third fiscal quarters 
the company does not modify payment terms on existing receivables  but may offer discounts for early payment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as it transacts business in multiple foreign currencies  including exposure related to anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
logitech transacts business in over currencies worldwide  of which the most significant to operations are the chinese renminbi cny  euro  british pound  taiwanese dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso and swiss franc 
the functional currency of the company s operations is primarily the us dollar 
to a lesser extent  certain operations use the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen or the local currency of the country as their functional currencies 
accordingly  unrealized foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to the us dollar are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the table below provides information about the company s underlying transactions that are sensitive to foreign exchange rate changes  primarily assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  where the net exposure is greater than million at march  the table below represents the us dollar impact on earnings of a appreciation and a depreciation of the functional currency as compared with the transaction currency in thousands fx gain loss fx gain loss net exposed from from long short appreciation of depreciation of currency functional functional functional currency transaction currency position currency currency us dollar chinese renminbi    euro british pound    taiwanese dollar us dollar    japanese yen us dollar    mexican peso us dollar  euro swedish krona  euro swiss franc  euro us dollar  australian dollar us dollar us dollar canadian dollar swiss franc us dollar long currency positions represent net assets being held in the transaction currency while short currency positions represent net liabilities being held in the transaction currency 
the company s principal manufacturing operations are located in china  with much of its component and raw material costs transacted in cny 
however  the functional currency of its chinese operating subsidiary is the us dollar as its sales and trade receivables are transacted in us dollars 
to hedge against any potential significant appreciation of the cny  the company transferred a portion of its cash investments to cny accounts 
at march   net assets held in cny totaled million 
the company continues to evaluate the level of net assets held in cny relative to component and raw material purchases and interest rates on cash equivalents 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to its subsidiaries forecasted inventory purchases 
the primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges 
logitech does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
