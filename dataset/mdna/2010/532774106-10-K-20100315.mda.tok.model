description of our business strategy we seek to increase our revenues and cash flow through achievement of a number of key strategic and operating goals  which include a sustaining leadership in our core television business  b building new audiences for our multiplatform product offerings  and c continuing our implementation of cost efficiencies and use of new technology to streamline operations 
the principal components of our strategy are to preserve our local news leadership 
we operated the number one or number two local news station in of our news markets 
for the year ended december  our stations are committed to a localist approach  which sustains our strong news positions and enhances our brand equity in the community 
we have been recognized for our local news expertise and have won many awards during the past year  including several emmy  associated press  edward r 
murrow and other local and regional awards 
we believe that strong local news programming is among the most important elements in attracting local advertising revenue 
in addition  news audiences serve as vital lead ins for other programming and help minimize the impact of changes in network programming 
sustain and grow our revenue share through a focus on local programming 
we are committed to improving the quality of our existing products  developing new local products  and investing in our future 
local programming allows us to leverage our existing production teams and on air talent while limiting our exposure to long term syndicated programming contracts 
it also allows us to be more creative and go beyond selling and second spots  and is supported by our advertisers 
in  we added nearly  hours of local programming and now have unique programs tailored to the communities we serve in the majority of our markets 
as a result of our strong local station brands  market leading news and sales expertise  we achieved market share growth in continue to pursue our multi channel strategy 
we continued to expand our presence in our local markets in through the launch of myaustintv on kbvo tv in austin  tx  and myritv  a digital channel in providence  ri 
these added channels and distribution capacity mark an innovative advance in our digital strategy  which is focused on reinventing existing channels and creating new brands that deliver targeted  niche programming to a multiplatform audience  when we believe there is a revenue growth opportunity 
our strategy also helps us appeal to a wider audience and market of advertisers while providing economies of scale to pursue additional and new programming services 
as a result  we believe our duopoly stations provide us with a substantial competitive advantage 
for the long term  we believe our spectrum has value beyond traditional television channels and digital technology enables us to separate a portion of that spectrum for incremental services 
we have been active in exploring use of that spectrum and have partnered with the open mobile video coalition to launch new technology that will provide live  local and national over the air digital television to consumers via next generation portable and mobile devices 

table of contents continue to invest in digital media 
our new media teams are focused on embracing new technologies and growing our portfolio of multimedia products and services that provide audiences around the clock access to our trusted local news and information 
we delivered our largest audience to date across all of our web sites in  including million user actions and approximately billion advertising impressions  with users engaging our content for more than minutes on average 
in addition  over million page impressions were served to users accessing our content via mobile devices 
our syndication strategy helped distribute video to users who consumed over million video views 
we will continue to focus on the depth and breadth of our content in order to become the local online destination for news and information in our markets  as well as expand our new media platform through mobility  short message service sms and interactive television 
additionally  on october   we completed the acquisition of red mccombs media  lp rmm  an online advertising and media services company based in austin  texas 
this acquisition significantly expands our local multi platform offerings by providing national advertising and enhanced services  including targeted display  rich media  video advertising  custom built vertical channels  search engine marketing  search engine optimization and mobile marketing 
secure subscriber fees from pay television operators 
local broadcast stations reach of us television households through carriage on cable  telecommunications and satellite multi channel video systems the surge of competition from satellite and telecommunications companies  combined with our strong local and national programming  provides us with compelling negotiating positions to obtain compensation for our channels 
we currently have agreements with every major cable  telecommunications and satellite company in the markets we serve 
continue to improve our operating efficiencies 
we have achieved company wide operating efficiencies through economies of scale in the purchase of programming  ratings services  research services  national sales representation  capital equipment and other vendor services 
in addition  we operate two regional television technology centers that have centralized engineering  operations and administration for multiple stations at a single location 
in  we successfully integrated all of our major mid west  new england and mid atlantic stations into our technology centers  saving manpower and reducing capital costs 
a current initiative is to improve our newsgathering and production process by sharing resources and multitasking 
we are transitioning to journalists that have a wide range of skills  including video camera operation  writing and editing 
our modern newsrooms create a unique and instantaneous reporting culture that drives cost reduction and efficiency 
as a result of careful planning  training and communication  our stations are embracing our new culture and working hard to produce more local news on a real time basis for our web  mobile and television using fewer resources 

table of contents principal sources of revenue local  national and political advertising revenues local  national and political advertising  net of agency commissions  represented approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we receive these revenues principally from advertising time sold in our local news  network and syndicated programming 
advertising rates are based upon a variety of factors  including size and demographic makeup of the market served by the television station  a program s popularity among television viewers  number of advertisers competing for the available time  availability of alternative advertising media in the station s market area  our station s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area  our station s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting  and effectiveness of our sales force 
network compensation the three oldest networks  abc  cbs and nbc  had historically made cash compensation payments for our carriage of their network programming 
however  in accordance with prevailing trends in our industry  our recent agreements with these networks now reflect a reduction and eventual elimination of network compensation payments to us and or require us to pay compensation to the network 
the newer networks  such as fox  cw and mynetworktv  provide less network programming  pay no network compensation and  in some instances  require us to pay network compensation 
however  these newer networks provide us with more advertising inventory to sell than abc  nbc or cbs

table of contents barter revenues we occasionally barter our unsold advertising inventory for goods and services that are required to operate our television stations or are used in sales and marketing efforts 
we also acquire certain syndicated programming by providing a portion of the available advertising inventory within the program  in lieu of cash payments 
digital revenues we generate digital revenues from advertising produced by our television stations internet web sites  from retransmission consent fees received from cable  satellite and telecommunications companies for the rights to carry our signals in their pay television services to consumers and by providing online advertising and media services through rmm 
other revenues we receive other revenues from sources such as renting space on our television towers  renting our production facilities  copyright royalties and providing television production services 
sources and availability of programming we program our television stations from the following program sources news and general entertainment programming that is produced by our local television stations  network programming such as csi or ugly betty  syndicated programming off network programs  such as the simpsons or two and a half men  and first run programs  such as jeopardy  entertainment tonight or wheel of fortune  paid programming arrangements where a third party pays our stations for a block of time  generally in one half hour or one hour time periods to air long form advertising or infomercials  and local weather station we provide a hour weather channel to local cable systems in certain of our television markets 
locally produced news and general entertainment programming our stations produce an aggregate of hours of local news programming per week that we broadcast on all but one of our stations 
we believe that successful local news programming is an important element in attracting local advertising revenues 
in addition  our news programs which have had historically high ratings and strong viewership  have served as strong lead ins for other programs and have created strong local station brands in each of our local communities 
local news programming also allows us greater control over our programming costs

the program service differs from a broadcast network in that it is closer to a television syndication business 

table of contents network programming all of our stations are affiliated with one of the national television networks 
our network affiliation agreements provide a local station certain exclusive rights and an obligation  subject to certain limited preemption rights  to carry the network programming 
while the networks retain most of the advertising time within their programs for their own use  the local station also has the right to sell a limited amount of advertising time within the network programs 
other time periods  which are not programmed by the networks  are programmed by the local station  for which the local station retains all of the advertising revenues 
networks also share certain of their programming with cable networks and make certain of their programming available through their web site or on web sites such as hulu 
com 
these outlets compete with us for viewers in the communities served by our stations 
the programming strength of a particular national television network may affect a local station s competitive position 
our stations  however  are diversified among the various networks  reducing the potential impact of any one network s performance 
we believe that national television network affiliations remain an efficient means of obtaining competitive programming  both for established stations with strong local news franchises and for newer stations with greater programming needs 
our stations generated an average of approximately of their total net revenue from the sale of advertising within network programming for the year ended december  our stations that are affiliated with abc  cbs  fox and nbc generate a higher percentage of revenue from the sale of advertising within network programming than stations affiliated with cw and mynetwork 
our affiliation agreements have terms with scheduled expiration dates ranging through december  these agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including a change of control of our company  which would generally result from the acquisition of shares having or more of the voting power of our company 
syndicated programming we acquire the rights to programs for time periods in which we do not air our local news or network programs 
these programs generally include reruns of current or former network programs  such as the simpsons or two and a half men  or first run syndicated programs  such as jeopardy  entertainment tonight or wheel of fortune 
we pay cash for these programs or exchange advertising time within the program for the cost of the program rights 
we compete with other local television stations to acquire these programs  which has caused the cost of program rights to increase over time 
in addition  a television viewer can now choose to watch many of these programs on national cable networks or purchase these programs on dvds or via downloads to computers  mobile video devices or web based video players  which has contributed to increasing fragmentation of our local television audience 

table of contents distribution of programming the programming that airs on our television stations can reach the television audience by one or more of the following distribution systems full power television stations  stations we operate under local marketing agreements  low power television stations  digital channels  cable television  satellite television systems  telecommunications systems  and internet 
full power television stations we own and or operate full power television stations that operate on the digital over the air channels through our full power television stations include two full power stations for which we provide programming  sales and other related services under local marketing agreements 
during  we successfully completed the digital transition of all of our stations as mandated by the fcc 
see our television stations for a listing of our full power television stations 
local marketing agreements the fcc television licenses for the two stations for which we provide programming  sales and other related services under local marketing agreements lmas are not owned by us 
revenues generated by these stations contributed  and to our net revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incur programming costs  operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operation of these stations  and retain all advertising revenues 
in providence and austin  the two local markets where these stations are located  we own and operate another station 
these local marketing agreement stations are an important part of our multi channel strategy 
we have a purchase option to acquire the fcc licenses for the lma stations in providence and austin 
low power television stations we own and operate a number of low power television stations 
we operate these stations either as stand alone station or as satellite stations 
these low power broadcast television stations are licensed by the fcc to provide service to substantially smaller areas than those of full power stations 
these stations contributed approximately of our total net revenue in each of the years ended december   and 
table of contents in five of our markets  albuquerque  austin  green bay  indianapolis and norfolk portsmouth newport news  we use our low power stations to extend the geographic reach of our primary stations in these markets 
in grand rapids we have affiliated wxsp tv  a group of low power television stations  with mynetworktv  to cover substantially all of the local market 
cable  satellite television and telecommunications systems according to nielsen  cable  satellite television and telecommunications companies currently provide video program services to approximately of total us television households  with cable and telecommunications companies serving of us households and satellite providers serving 
as a result  cable  satellite television and telecommunications companies are not only primary competitors  but the primary means by which our television audience views our television stations 
most of our stations are distributed pursuant to retransmission consent agreements with multichannel video program distributors that operate in markets we serve 
as of december   we had retransmission consent agreements with distributors  including msos and regional telecommunications companies  the two major satellite television providers  and two national telecommunications providers 
for an overview of fcc regulations governing carriage of television broadcast signals by multichannel video program distributors  see federal regulation of broadcasting cable and satellite carriage of local television signals 
internet we operate interactive television station and niche web sites in us markets and offer a growing portfolio of internet based products and services that provide traditional and new audiences around the clock access to our trusted local news and information 
we delivered our largest audience to date across all of our web sites in  including million user actions and approximately billion advertising impressions  with users engaging our content for more than minutes on average 
in addition  over million page impressions were served to users accessing our content via mobile devices 
our syndication strategy helped distribute video to users who consumed over million video views 
seasonality of our business our advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each calendar year  due generally to higher advertising in the spring season and in the period leading up to and including the end of year holiday season 
our operating results are also significantly affected by annual cycles  as advertising revenues are generally higher in even numbered years ie   due to additional revenues associated with election years from advertising spending by political candidates and incremental advertising revenues associated with olympic broadcasts 
the broadcast television industry is also cyclical in nature and affected by prevailing economic conditions 
since we rely on sales of advertising time for substantially all of our revenues  our operating results are sensitive to general economic and regional conditions in each local market where our stations operate 

table of contents joint venture with nbc universal we hold an approximately equity interest  and nbc universal holds the remaining approximately equity interest  in a joint venture which is a limited partner in a business that owns television stations kxas tv  an nbc affiliate in dallas  and knsd tv  an nbc affiliate in san diego 
we and nbc universal each have a voting interest in the joint venture 
nbc universal operates the two stations pursuant to a management agreement 
the joint venture is the obligor on an million non amortizing senior secured note due the gecc note held by general electric capital corporation gecc  which provided financing to the venture 
the gecc note bears interest at a rate of per annum until march  and per annum thereafter 
lin tv has guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the gecc note 
the joint venture with nbc universal has been adversely impacted by the recent economic downturn  and it did not distribute any cash to nbc universal or us during the year ended december  in light of the adverse effect of the economic downturn on the joint venture s operating results  in we entered into an agreement with nbc universal the original shortfall funding agreement which provided that a we and nbc waived the requirement that the joint venture maintain debt service reserve cash balances of at least million  b the joint venture would use a portion of its existing debt service reserve cash balances to fund interest payments in  c nbc agreed to defer its receipt of and management fees  and d we agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to fund interest payments on the gecc note through april   we and nbc universal would each provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
during the year ended december   the joint venture used approximately million of the existing debt service cash reserves  leaving approximately million available 
as of march   we have not yet provided any funding under the original shortfall funding agreement 
because of anticipated future cash shortfalls at the joint venture  on march   nbc universal and we entered into a new agreement the shortfall funding agreement covering the period through april  under the terms of the shortfall funding agreement a the joint venture may continue to access any portion of its existing debt service reserve cash balances to fund interest payments  b nbc will continue to defer the payment of and management fees and will defer payment of management fees through march   and c we agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to fund interest payments on the gecc note through april   we and nbc universal would each provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
based on our latest estimate of cash flow requirements of the joint venture through april   our share of the estimated shortfall through april  is million 
of this amount  we had accrued million as of september  subsequent to september   we a received with the joint venture s budget and b as noted above  entered into the shortfall funding agreement to cover debt service shortfalls through april  based on the budget provided by the joint venture  and our discussions with the joint venture s management  we believe there will be an additional debt service shortfall at the joint venture from april  through april  of million to million  of which  our share of the shortfall could be approximately million 
as a result  we have accrued our portion of the estimated shortfalls through april   bringing the total accrual for our joint venture shortfall obligations to million as of december  this amount reflects our probable and estimable obligations through the expiration of the shortfall funding agreement on april  we do not believe our funding obligations related to the joint venture  if any  beyond april  are currently probable and estimable  therefore  we have not accrued for any potential obligations beyond the million discussed above 
however  our actual cash shortfall funding could exceed our estimate 

table of contents our ability to honor our shortfall loan obligations under the original shortfall funding agreement and or the shortfall funding agreement is limited by certain covenants contained in our amended credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes 
if we are unable to make payments under the original shortfall funding agreement or shortfall funding agreement  the joint venture may be unable to fund interest obligations under the gecc note  resulting in an event of default 
in addition  if the joint venture experiences further cash shortfalls beyond april   we may decide to fund such cash shortfalls  or to fund such shortfalls through further loans or equity contributions to the joint venture 
on december   general electric corporation ge  which wholly owns gecc  and comcast corporation comcast announced a definitive agreement to form a joint venture that will be percent owned by comcast  percent owned by ge and managed by comcast 
the proposed joint venture will include nbc universal 
as of march   the proposed transaction is undergoing regulatory review and it is not certain whether or when the transaction will receive the approvals required to close 
furthermore  assuming the transaction is completed  we cannot predict the effect the joint venture between comcast and ge may have on our joint venture with nbc universal 
for more information about our joint venture with nbc universal  see item a 
risk factors the gecc note could result in significant liabilities  including i requiring us to make short term cash payments to the nbc universal joint venture to fund interest payments  and ii potentially giving rise to a change of control under our existing indebtedness  which could cause such indebtedness to become immediately due and payable  as well as the description in the liquidity and capital resources section under item management s discussion and analysis and note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
competitive conditions in the television industry the television broadcast industry has become highly competitive as a result of new technologies and new program distribution systems 
in most of our local markets  we compete directly against other local broadcast stations  cable  satellite television and telecommunication systems for audience 
we also compete with online video services  including web sites such as hulu 
com  which provide access to some of the same programming  including network programming that we provide and other emerging technologies including mobile television 
federal regulation of television broadcasting overview of regulatory issues 
our television operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc under the communications act of  as amended the communications act 
the communications act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except pursuant to licenses issued by the fcc and empowers the fcc  among other things  to issue  renew  revoke and modify broadcasting licenses  assign frequency bands  determine stations frequencies  locations and power  and regulate the equipment used by stations 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a license without the fcc s prior approval 
the fcc also regulates certain aspects of the operation of cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite dbs systems and other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations 
in addition  the fcc regulates matters such as television station ownership  network affiliate relations  cable and dbs systems carriage of television station signals  carriage of syndicated and network programming on distant stations  political advertising practices  children s programming and obscene and indecent programming 

table of contents license renewals 
under the communications act  the fcc generally may grant and renew broadcast licenses for terms of eight years  though licenses may be renewed for a shorter period under certain circumstances 
the communications act requires the fcc to renew a broadcast license if the fcc finds that i the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  ii there have been no serious violations of either the communications act or the fcc s rules and regulations by the licensee  and iii there have been no other serious violations that taken together constitute a pattern of abuse 
in making its determination  the fcc may consider petitions to deny but cannot consider whether the public interest would be better served by issuing the license to a person other than the renewal applicant 
we are in good standing with respect to each of our fcc licenses 
our licenses have expiration dates ranging between and the table on page includes the expiration date of each of our licenses 
we have timely filed license renewal applications for each of our stations 
once an application for renewal is filed  each station remains licensed while its application is pending  even after its license expiration date has passed 
certain of our licenses have pending applications for renewal 
we expect the fcc to renew each of these licenses but we make no assurance that it will do so 
ownership regulation 
the communications act and fcc rules limit the ability of individuals and entities to have ownership or other attributable interests in certain combinations of broadcast stations and other media 
in  the fcc modified its local television ownership rules 
in  the fcc issued an order that would have liberalized most of the ownership rules  permitting us to acquire television stations in certain markets where we are currently prohibited from acquiring additional stations 
in  the third circuit court of appeals stayed and remanded several of the fcc s ownership rule changes 
in july  as part of the fcc s statutorily required quadrennial review of its media ownership rules  the fcc sought comment on how to address the issues raised by the third circuit court of appeals s decision 
in february  the fcc released an order that re adopted its local television ownership rules  and those rules are currently in effect 
several parties have appealed the fcc s february decision 
in november  the fcc initiated its statutorily required quadrennial review process  but it has not yet proposed any rule changes 
we cannot predict how pending appeals of prior fcc ownership rule decisions or the pending quadrennial review proceeding may result in changes to the fcc s broadcast ownership rules 
the fcc s currently effective ownership rules that are material to our operations are summarized below 
local television ownership 
under the fcc s current local television ownership or duopoly rule  a party may own multiple television stations without regard to signal contour overlap provided they are located in separate nielsen dmas 
in addition  the rules permit parties to own up to two tv stations in the same dma so long as i at least one of the two stations is not among the top four ranked stations in the market based on audience share at the time an application for approval of the acquisition is filed with the fcc  and ii at least eight independently owned and operating full power commercial and non commercial television stations would remain in the market after the acquisition 
in addition  without regard to the number of remaining or independently owned television stations  the fcc will permit television duopolies within the same dma so long as the grade b signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap 
stations designated by the fcc as satellite stations  which are full power stations that typically rebroadcast the programming of a parent station  are exempt from the local television ownership rule 
also  the fcc may grant a waiver of the local television ownership rule if one of the two television stations is a failed or failing station or if the proposed transaction would result in the construction of a new television station an unbuilt station waiver 
we are currently in compliance with the local television ownership rule 

table of contents the fcc s ownership order established a new rule attributing lmas for ownership purposes 
the fcc grandfathered lmas that were entered into prior to november   permitting those stations to continue operations pursuant to the lmas until the conclusion of the fcc s biennial review 
the fcc stated it would conduct a case by case review of grandfathered lmas and assess the appropriateness of extending the grandfathering periods 
subsequently  the fcc invited comments as to whether  instead of beginning the review of the grandfathered lmas in  it should do so in the fcc did not initiate any review of grandfathered lmas in or as part of its quadrennial review 
we do not know when  or if  the fcc will conduct any such review of grandfathered lmas 
grandfathered local marketing agreements can be freely transferred during the grandfather period  but duopolies may be transferred only where the two station combination continues to qualify under the duopoly rule 
we must obtain fcc approval before acquiring ownership of additional television stations  including the stations in providence and austin for which we have option agreements 
in the event that the fcc determines that the grandfathered lma that we have in providence is ineligible for conversion to full ownership  we have the right to assign our purchase option to a third party and we believe we can arrange a suitable disposition  including alternative non attributable operating arrangements with such a party  such as a more limited programming and services agreement or joint sales agreement  if necessary  which will not be materially less favorable to us than the current local marketing agreement 
in austin  we assigned our purchase option for knva tv  for which we also have a grandfathered lma  to a third party  vaughan media  llc  that during exercised the option and acquired the outstanding shares of the entity that holds the fcc license for that station 
we continue to provide programming and other services to knva tv pursuant to the grandfathered lma with that station 
national television ownership cap 
the communications act  as amended in  limits the number of television stations one entity may own nationally 
under the rule  no entity may have an attributable interest in television stations that reach  in the aggregate  more than of all us television households 
the fcc currently discounts the audience reach of a uhf station by when computing the national television ownership cap 
our stations reach is approximately of us households 
media cross ownership 
the fcc historically has prohibited the licensee of a radio or tv station from directly or indirectly owning  operating  or controlling a daily newspaper if the station s specified service contour encompasses the entire community where the newspaper is published 
the fcc revised its newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule in december  however  since the order revising that rule was appealed the rule is not yet effective 
under the revised rule  newspaper broadcast cross ownership would nonetheless be permissible if i the market at issue is one of the largest dmas  ii the transaction involves the combination of only one major daily newspaper and only one television or radio station  iii where the transaction involves a television station  at least eight independently owned and operating major media voices major newspapers and full power television stations would remain in the dma following the transaction  and iv where the transaction involves a television station  that station is not among the top four ranked stations in the dma 
for all other proposed newspaper broadcast transactions  the fcc s historic prohibition generally would remain in place 
the cross ownership rules also permit cross ownership of radio and television stations under a graduated test based on the number of independently owned media voices in the local market 
in large markets markets with at least independently owned media voices  a single entity can own up to one television station and seven radio stations or  if permissible under the local television ownership rule if eight full power television stations would remain in the market post transaction  two television stations and six radio stations 

table of contents attribution of ownership 
under the fcc s attribution policies  the following relationships and interests generally are attributable for purposes of the fcc s broadcast ownership restrictions holders of or more of the licensee s voting stock  unless the holder is a qualified passive investor  in which case the threshold is a or greater voting stock interest  all officers and directors of a licensee and its direct or indirect parent s  any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company  unless properly insulated from management activities  and equity and or debt interests which in the aggregate exceed of a licensee s total assets  if the interest holder supplies more than of the station s total weekly programming  or is a same market broadcast company  cable operator or newspaper the equity debt plus standard 
under the single majority shareholder exception to the fcc s attribution policies  otherwise attributable interests under are not attributable if a corporate licensee is controlled by a single majority shareholder and the minority interest holder is not otherwise attributable under the equity debt plus standard 
thus  in our case  where we have a single majority shareholder  ownership of minority stock interests of up to are not attributable absent other factors 
because of these multiple ownership and cross ownership rules  any person or entity that acquires an attributable interest in us may violate the fcc s rules if that purchaser also has an attributable interest in other television or radio stations  or in daily newspapers  depending on the number and location of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers 
such person or entity also may be restricted in the companies in which it may invest to the extent that those investments give rise to an attributable interest 
if the holder of an attributable interest violates any of these ownership rules or if a proposed acquisition by us would cause such a violation  we may be unable to obtain from the fcc one or more authorizations needed to conduct our television station business and may be unable to obtain the fcc s consents for certain future acquisitions 
digital television transition 
we terminated all analog broadcasts on our full power stations on or before june  in connection with the transition to digital television 
following the transition  each of our full power stations broadcasts a megabit per second mbps data stream  rather than a single analog program stream 
fcc regulations permit substantial flexibility in how we use that data stream 
for example  we are permitted to provide a mix of high definition and standard television program streams free to air  additional program related data  subscription video or audio streams  and non broadcast services 
a new technical standard  currently being tested  would permit digital stations to provide video and data streams that can be more readily received on mobile devices such as computers and smart phones  if those devices incorporate the technology 
these digital channels remain subject to specific fcc regulations 
for example  we are required to carry additional children s educational programming if we transmit multiple program streams  and we must pay the us treasury of gross revenues for any non broadcast services we provide using our digital signals 
the fcc is evaluating whether to impose further public interest programming requirements on digital broadcasters 
the fcc s current digital transition implementation plan would maintain the secondary status of low power television stations with respect to dtv operations and many low power television stations  particularly in major markets  could be displaced  including some of ours 

table of contents cable and satellite carriage of local television signals 
pursuant to fcc rules  full power television stations can obtain carriage of their signals by multichannel program distributors in one of two ways via mandatory carriage or via retransmission consent 
once every three years each station must formally elect either mandatory carriage must carry for cable distributors and carry one carry all for satellite television providers or retransmission consent 
the next election must be made by october   and will be effective january  a mandatory carriage election invokes fcc rules that requires the distributor to carry a single program stream and related data in the station s local market 
distributors may decline carriage for a variety of reasons  including a lack of channel capacity  the station s failure to deliver a good quality signal  the presence of a nearby affiliate of the same network or  in the case of satellite distributors  if the distributor does not carry any other local broadcast stations in the electing station s market 
distributors do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage 
a station that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights  and the station and the distributor must negotiate in good faith for carriage of the station s signal 
negotiated terms may include channel position  service tier carriage  carriage of multiple program streams  compensation and other consideration 
if a station elects to negotiate retransmission terms  it is possible that the station and the distributor will not reach agreement and that the distributor will not carry the station s signal 
fcc rules govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive 
congress has also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to unserved households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network affiliated station 
one law that facilitates satellite distribution of local broadcast signals  the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act of shvera  would have expired by its terms at the end of however  congress extended shvera until march  we believe congress will again extend the shvera regime  with some changes  before the end of that period  but we cannot provide assurances that congress will do so 
programming and station operations 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
broadcast station licensees are required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
stations must follow various rules that regulate  among other things  children s television programming and advertising  political advertising  sponsorship identification  contest and lottery advertising and program ratings guidelines 
the fcc has proposed to re establish a number of formalized procedures designed to improve television broadcasters service to their local communities 
these proposals include the establishment of community advisory boards  quantitative programming guidelines and maintenance of a main studio in a station s community of license 
the fcc is also charged with enforcing restrictions or prohibitions on the broadcast of obscene and indecent programs and in recent years has increased its enforcement activities in this area  issuing large fines against radio and television stations found to have carried such programming even if originated by a third party program supplier  such as a network 
in june  the fcc increased the maximum monetary penalty for carriage of indecent programming tenfold to  per station per violation with a cap of million for any single act  and put the licenses of repeat offenders in jeopardy 
court challenges to the fcc s indecency enforcement regime are pending at various stages 
we are unable to predict whether the enforcement of the indecency regulations will have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide competitive programming 

table of contents recent regulatory developments  proposed legislation and regulation 
congress and the fcc currently have under consideration  and may in the future adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect  directly or indirectly  the operation and ownership of our stations

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks associated with our business activities our operating results are primarily dependent on advertising revenues  which can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control  including economic downturns and viewer preferences 
our operations and performance are materially affected by a number of factors beyond our control  including economic conditions and viewer preferences 
for example  the economic downturn adversely affected local and national advertising revenues across all of our stations during advertising revenue  including local  national and political advertising revenues  consisted of approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
local advertising revenues decreased and for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to their respective prior periods 
national advertising revenues decreased  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  compared to their respective prior periods 
this volatility in advertising revenues results in decreased revenues and weaker results of operations for us 
while we have seen some signs of recovery  continued weakness in advertising revenues caused by economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations  which could impair our ability to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments  as more fully described below 
in addition to economic conditions  our ability to generate advertising revenues depends on factors such as the relative popularity of the programming on our stations  the demographic characteristics of our markets  and the activities of our competitors 
our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership or we may not achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenues to decline 
we  and those on whom we rely for programming  may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in viewer tastes and interests of our local markets 
in addition  political advertising revenue from elections and advertising revenues from olympic games  which generally occur in the even years  create large fluctuations in our operating results on a year to year basis 
for example  during  we had political advertising revenues of million  compared to million in the prior year 
we depend to a significant degree on automotive advertising 
approximately  and of our net advertising revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted of automotive advertising 
a significant decrease in these revenues in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows  which could affect our ability to fund operations and service our debt obligations and affect the value of our common stock 
automotive advertising continues to be adversely affected by the difficulties experienced by the automotive industry 

table of contents the gecc note could result in significant liabilities  including i requiring us to make short term cash payments to the nbc universal joint venture to fund interest payments  and ii potentially giving rise to a change of control under our existing indebtedness  which would cause such existing indebtedness to become immediately due and payable 
we may be required to make cash payments to the joint venture to fund interest payments on the gecc note 
our joint venture with nbc universal has been adversely impacted by the current economic downturn 
under the original shortfall funding agreement  we may be required to provide shortfall loans to the joint venture  in an amount based on our approximately economic interest in the joint venture  if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to fund interest obligations under the gecc note through april  as of march   we have not yet provided any funding under the original shortfall funding agreement 
because of anticipated future cash shortfalls at the joint venture  on march   nbc universal and we entered into the shortfall funding agreement covering the period through april  under the shortfall funding agreement a the joint venture may continue to access any portion of its existing debt service reserve cash balances to fund interest payments  b nbc will continue to defer the payment of and management fees and will defer payment of management fees through march   and c we agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to fund interest payments on the gecc note through april   we and nbc universal would each provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
under the terms of the original shortfall funding agreement and the shortfall funding agreement  we estimate our share of shortfall funding could be million to million through the april  expiry of the shortfall funding agreement 
however  our actual cash shortfall funding could exceed our estimate 
our ability to honor our shortfall loan obligations under the original shortfall funding agreement and the shortfall funding agreement is subject to compliance with restrictions under our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes 
based on the budget provided by joint venture management  and our forecast of total leverage and consolidated ebitda during and  we expect to have the capacity within these restrictions to provide shortfall funding under the shortfall funding agreement in proportion to our approximately percent economic interest in the joint venture through the april  expiration of the shortfall funding agreement 
however  there can be no assurance that we will have the capacity within these restrictions to provide such funding 
if we are required to fund a portion of a shortfall loan  we plan to use our available cash balances or available borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  if the joint venture experiences further cash shortfalls beyond april   we may decide to fund such cash shortfalls  or to fund such shortfalls through further loans or equity contributions to the joint venture 
if we are unable to make payments under the original shortfall funding agreement or shortfall funding agreement  the joint venture may be unable to fund interest obligations under the gecc note  resulting in an event of default 

table of contents an event of default under the gecc note will occur if the joint venture fails to make any scheduled interest payment within days of the date due and payable  or to pay the principal amount on the maturity date 
if the joint venture fails to pay interest on the gecc note  and neither nbc universal nor we make a shortfall loan to fund the interest payment within days of the date due and payable  an event of default would occur and gecc could accelerate the maturity of the entire amount due under the gecc note 
other than the acceleration of the principal amount upon an event of default  prepayment of the principal of the note is prohibited unless agreed upon by both nbc universal and us 
upon an event of default under the gecc note  gecc s only recourse would be to the joint venture  our equity interest in the joint venture and  after exhausting all remedies against the assets of the joint venture and the other equity interests in the joint venture  to lin tv pursuant to its guarantee of the gecc note 
under the terms of its guarantee of the gecc note  lin tv would be required to make a payment for an amount to be determined upon occurrence of the following events a there is an event of default  b neither nbc universal or us remedy the default  and c after gecc exhausts all remedies against the assets of the joint venture  the total amount realized upon exercise of those remedies is less than the million principal amount of the gecc note 
upon the occurrence of such events  the amount owed by lin tv to gecc pursuant to the guarantee would be equal to the difference between i the total amount for which the joint venture s assets were sold and ii the principal amount and any unpaid interest due under the gecc note 
as of december   we estimate the fair value of the television stations in the joint venture to be approximately million less than the outstanding balance of the gecc note of million 
if an event of default occurs under the gecc note  lin tv  which conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries  could experience material adverse consequences  including gecc  after exhausting all remedies against the joint venture  could enforce its rights under the guarantee  which could cause lin tv to determine that lin television should seek to sell material assets owned by it in order to satisfy lin tv s obligations under the guarantee  gecc s initiation of proceedings against lin tv under the guarantee could result in a change of control or other material adverse consequences to lin television  which could cause an acceleration of lin television s credit facility and other outstanding indebtedness  and if the gecc note is prepaid because of an acceleration on default or otherwise  we would incur a substantial tax liability of approximately million related to our deferred gain associated with the formation of the joint venture  exclusive of any potential nol utilization 
we have a substantial amount of debt  which could adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  reduce our operating flexibility and put us at greater risk for default and acceleration of our debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness and a deficit of million of consolidated stockholders equity 
our outstanding debt under our credit facility is due november  and all of our senior subordinated notes are due may  subject to the limitations in our senior credit facility and the indentures governing the senior subordinated notes  we may incur additional material indebtedness in the future  and we may become more leveraged 
accordingly  we now have and will continue to have significant debt service obligations 
we have also guaranteed the million gecc note as described above 

table of contents our large amount of indebtedness could  for example require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on indebtedness and reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate activities  require us to dispose of television stations or other assets at times or on terms that may be less advantageous than those we might otherwise be able to obtain  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  expose us to greater interest rate risk  because the interest rates on our credit facility vary  and impair our ability to successfully withstand a sustained downturn in our business or the economy in general and place us at a disadvantage relative to our less leveraged competitors 
the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes also contain change of control provisions which may require us to purchase all or a portion of our senior subordinated notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity and results of operations 
we could fail to comply with our financial covenants  which would adversely affect our financial condition 
our debt instruments require us to comply with financial covenants  including  among others  leverage ratios and interest coverage tests 
these covenants restrict the manner in which we conduct our business and may impact our operating results 
further  weak results of operations due to reduced advertising revenues may make it harder for us to comply with such covenants 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of our indebtedness under our debt agreements or under other instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
in the past  we have obtained amendments with respect to compliance with financial ratio tests in our credit facility 
for example  on july   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and banks and financial institutions party thereto  as a result of the continued declines in revenues during and to address continued compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreement 
for further information on the amended credit agreement see description of indebtedness 
consents or amendments that may be required in the future may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
our debt instruments also contain certain other restrictions on our business and operations  including  for example  covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations and make capital expenditures 

table of contents we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations  forcing us to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell assets or obtain additional financing  which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  will be subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
cash interest paid during the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
our required payments of principal were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to pay our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow  or refinance our indebtedness  or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms  we may have to seek to restructure our remaining debt obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our class a common stock and the market  if any  for our debt 
the current volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to refinance our debt or to refinance our debt on terms similar to our existing debt agreements 
additionally  we have a history of net losses and a substantial accumulated deficit 
we had net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily as a result of impairment of our broadcast licenses and goodwill  and interest expense 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of billion 
these losses may or may not recur  and our accumulated deficit may therefore continue indefinitely 
we have a material amount of intangible assets and we have recorded substantial impairments of these assets 
future write downs of intangible assets would reduce net income or increase net loss  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of our class a common stock 
future impairment charges could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results of operations and stockholders equity 
approximately million or of our total assets as of december  consisted of indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill  which are required to be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or the intangible asset over its fair value 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant 
we recorded an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  and we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for further details see note intangible assets 
if we determine in a future period  as part of our testing for impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  that the carrying amount of our intangible assets exceeds the fair value of these assets  we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of our class a common stock 

table of contents our strategy has historically included growth through acquisitions  which could pose various risks and increase our leverage 
we have pursued and intend to selectively continue to pursue strategic acquisitions  subject to market conditions  our liquidity  and the availability of attractive acquisition candidates  with the goal of improving our business 
we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets nor have the financial capacity to complete future acquisitions 
acquisitions involve inherent risks  such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition 
we may not be able to successfully implement effective cost controls or increase revenues as a result of any acquisition 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management s attention from the operation of our core business 
certain acquisitions  such as television stations  are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest some television stations if the fcc believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
hmc and its affiliates  whose interests may differ from your interests  have approval rights with respect to significant transactions and could convert their equity interests in our company into a block of substantial voting power  thereby reducing the voting power of our other shareholders 
hmc and its affiliates own one share of our class c common stock  which represents of our outstanding voting power  and also have the ability to convert shares of our non voting class b common stock into class a common stock  subject to fcc approval 
upon the conversion of the majority of the non voting class b common stock into class a common stock  the class c common stock will automatically convert into an equal number of shares of class a common stock 
if this occurs  affiliates of hmc would own approximately of our voting equity interests and will effectively have the ability to elect the entire board of directors and to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of hmc and its affiliates may differ from the interests of our other stockholders and hmc and its affiliates could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our other stockholders 
for example  hmc may from time to time acquire and hold controlling or non controlling interests in television broadcast assets that may directly or indirectly compete with our company for advertising revenues 
in addition  hmc and its affiliates may from time to time identify  pursue and consummate acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
moreover  royal w 
carson  iii  a director  and hmc  combined beneficially own all of our class c common stock and therefore possess of the combined voting power 
accordingly  mr 
carson and hmc together have the power to elect our entire board of directors and  through this control  to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
mr 
carson has prior business relations with hmc 
mr 
carson is the president of carson private capital incorporated  an investment firm that sponsors funds of funds and dedicated funds that have invested substantially all of the net capital of these funds in private equity investment funds sponsored by firms like hmc or its affiliates 
mr 
carson also serves on an advisory board representing the interests of limited partners of hicks  muse  tate furst equity fund v  lp  sector performance fund  lp  and hicks  muse  tate furst europe fund lp  which are sponsored by hmc

table of contents if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue could decline 
the entertainment industry  and particularly the television industry  is highly competitive and is undergoing a period of consolidation and significant change 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment alternatives  such as cable  satellite television and telecommunications video services  internet  wireless  pay per view and video on demand  digital video recorders  dvds and mobile video devices have fragmented television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to new types of competition 
as a result  we are experiencing increased competition for viewing audience and advertisers 
significant declines in viewership and advertising revenues could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new technologies may affect our broadcasting operations 
the television broadcasting business is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and the emergence of new technologies 
we cannot predict the effect such technologies will have on our broadcast operations 
in addition  the capital expenditures necessary to implement these new technologies could be substantial and other companies employing such technologies before we are able to could aggressively compete with our business 
it would be difficult to take us over  which could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock 
affiliates of hmc effectively have the ability to determine whether a change of control will occur through their ownership of one of the two outstanding shares of our class c common stock and all of the shares of our class b common stock 
provisions of delaware corporate law and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation  including the voting power of our class c common stock held by mr 
carson and hmc and the voting power that affiliates of hmc would hold upon conversion of their shares of class b stock into class a stock or class c stock  make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would benefit the holders of our class a common stock 
these provisions and controlling ownership by affiliates of hmc could also adversely affect the public trading price of our class a common stock 

table of contents the loss of network affiliation agreements or changes in network affiliations could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations if we are unable to quickly replace the network affiliation 
the non renewal or termination of a network affiliation agreement or a change in network affiliations could have a material adverse effect on us 
each of the networks generally provides our affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  our stations broadcast network inserted commercials during that programming and  in some cases  receive cash payments from networks 
in other cases  we make cash payments to certain networks 
some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including as a result of a change of control of our company  which would generally result upon the acquisition of shares having or more of our voting power 
in the event that affiliates of hmc elect to convert our class b common stock shares held by them into shares of either class a common stock or class c common stock  such conversion may result in a change of control of our company causing an early termination of some or all of our network affiliation agreements 
some of the networks with which our stations are affiliated have required us  upon renewal of affiliation agreements  to reduce or eliminate network compensation and  in specific cases  to make cash payments to the network  and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements 
consequently  our affiliation agreements may not all remain in place and each network may not continue to provide programming or compensation to us on the same basis as it currently provides programming or compensation to our stations 
if any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with networks for any reason  we would need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive and more expensive 
a change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short term and long term consequences  depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change 
potential short term consequences include a increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs  which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station s viewing audience  b short term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch  c costs of building a new or larger news operation  d other increases in station programming costs  if necessary  and e the cost of equipment needed to conform the station s programming  equipment and logos to the new network affiliation 
long term consequences are more difficult to assess  due to the cyclical nature of each of the major network s share of the audience that changes from year to year with programs coming to the end of their production cycle  and the audience acceptance of new programs in the future and the fact that national network audience ratings are not necessarily indicative of how a network s programming is accepted in an individual market 
how well a particular network fares in an affiliation switch depends largely on the value of the broadcast license  which is influenced by the length of time the television station has been broadcasting  the quality and location of the license  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station and the quality of the station non network programming 
in addition  the majority of the revenue earned by television stations is attributable to locally produced news and syndicated programming  rather than to network affiliation payments and advertising sales related to network programming 
the circumstances that may surround a network affiliation switch cause uncertainty as to the actual costs that will be incurred by us and  if these costs are significant  the switch could have a material adverse impact on the income we derive from the affected station 

table of contents changes by the national broadcast television networks in their respective business models and practices could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in recent years  the networks have streamed their programming on the internet and other distribution platforms in close proximity to network programming broadcast on local television stations  including those we own 
these and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and could adversely affect the business  financial conditions and results of operations of our stations 
we depend on key personnel  and we may not be able to operate and grow our businesses effectively if we lose the services of our management or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
we depend on the efforts of our management and other key employees 
the success of our business depends heavily on our ability to develop and retain management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
competition for senior management personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain our key personnel 
if we are unable to do so  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 
risks related to our industry the fcc s national broadband plan could result in the reallocation of broadcast spectrum for wireless broadband use  which could materially impair our ability to provide competitive services 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of directed the fcc to deliver to congress  within one year of enactment  a national broadband plan 
the fcc has indicated that it will deliver the national broadband plan to congress by march  certain members of the fcc s national broadband plan staff have expressed the view that some or all of the spectrum presently allocated for television broadcasting should be reclaimed and reallocated to be used for other purposes  including mobile wireless broadband  and in informal discussions with broadcasters and other stakeholders they have described possible mechanisms by which this could be accomplished 
if the national broadband plan includes one or more proposals to reallocate broadcast spectrum  further action by the fcc or congress  or both  would be necessary in order to develop and implement them 
a reallocation  if it occurs  could result in voluntary or involuntary modification of television broadcast licenses 
we cannot predict the likelihood  timing  or extent of a spectrum reallocation 
if some or all of our television stations are required to change frequencies or reduce the amount of spectrum they use  our stations could suffer material adverse effects  including but not limited to substantial conversion costs  reduction or loss of over the air signal coverage  and an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams  including mobile video services 
our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by the interests of networks with whom we are affiliated 
our affiliation agreements with some broadcast networks include certain terms that may affect our ability to permit cable  satellite and telecommunications providers mvpds to retransmit network programming  and in some cases  we may lose the right to grant retransmission consent to such providers 
we may not be able to successfully negotiate retransmission consent agreements with the mvpds in our local markets if the broadcast networks withhold their consent to the retransmission of those portions of our stations signals containing network programming  or the networks may require us to pay compensation in exchange for permitting redistribution of network programming by mvpds 
if we are required to make payments to networks in connection with signal retransmission  those payments may adversely affect our operating results 
if we lose the right to grant retransmission consent  we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing retransmission consent agreements with mvpds and there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs  and increased programming costs could adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs 
we often acquire program rights two or three years in advance  making it difficult for us to accurately predict how a program will perform 
in some instances  we may have to replace programs before their costs have been fully amortized  resulting in impairments and write offs that increase station operating costs 
we may be exposed to future programming cost increases  which may adversely affect our operating results 
federal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility  which may affect our ability to generate revenue or reduce our costs 
the fcc regulates our business  just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry 
we must ask the fcc s approval whenever we need a new license  seek to renew  assign or modify a license  purchase a new station  sell an existing station or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license 
our fcc licenses and those of the stations we program pursuant to lmas are critical to our operations  we cannot operate without them 
we cannot be certain that the fcc will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions in a timely manner  if at all 
if licenses are not renewed or acquisitions approved  we may lose revenue that we otherwise could have earned 
in addition  congress and the fcc may  in the future  adopt new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters including technological changes that could  directly or indirectly  materially and adversely affect the operation and ownership of our broadcast properties 
see federal regulation of television broadcasting in item business changes in fcc ownership rules through fcc action  judicial review or federal legislation may limit our ability to continue providing services to stations under local marketing agreements  may prevent us from obtaining ownership of the stations we currently provide services to under local marketing agreements and or may preclude us from obtaining the full economic value of one or more of our duopoly  or two station operations upon a sale  merger or other similar transaction transferring ownership of such station or stations 
fcc ownership rules currently impose significant limitations on the ability of broadcast licensees to have attributable interests in multiple media properties 
in addition  federal law prohibits one company from owning broadcast television stations that collectively have service areas encompassing more than an aggregate share of national television households 
ownership restrictions under fcc rules also include a variety of local limits on media ownership 
the restrictions include an ownership limit of one television station in most medium and smaller television markets and two stations in most larger markets  known as the television duopoly rule 
the regulations also include a prohibition on the common ownership of a newspaper and television station in the same market newspaper television cross ownership  limits on common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market radio television station ownership and limits on radio ownership of four to eight radio stations in a local market 

table of contents should the fcc liberalize media ownership rules  attractive opportunities may arise for additional television station and other media acquisitions 
but these changes also create additional competition for us from other entities  such as national broadcast networks  large station groups  newspaper chains and cable operators who may be better positioned to take advantage of such changes and benefit from the resulting operating synergies both nationally and in specific markets 
should the television duopoly rule become relaxed  we may be able to acquire the ownership of one or both of the stations in austin and providence for which we currently provide programming  sales and other related services under local marketing agreements and for which we have purchase option agreements to purchase these stations 
should we be unable to do so  there is no assurance that the grandfathering of our local marketing agreements will be permitted beyond conclusion of the current further rule making 
we had net revenues of million  or of our total net revenues  attributable to local marketing agreements for the year ended december  any potential hostilities  natural disasters or terrorist attacks may affect our revenues and results of operations 
if the us becomes engaged in new  large scale foreign hostilities  is impacted by any significant natural disasters or if there is a terrorist attack against the us  we may lose advertising revenue and incur increased broadcasting expenses due to pre emption  delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns and increased costs of providing news coverage of such events 
we cannot predict the extent and duration of any future disruption to our programming schedule  the amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed or the amount by which our expenses would increase as a result 
consequently  any related future loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we maintain our corporate headquarters in providence under an operating lease that expires on march  each of our stations has facilities consisting of offices  studios  sales offices and tower and transmitter sites 
tower and transmitter sites are located in areas that provide optimal coverage to each of our markets 
we own substantially all of the offices and studios where our stations are located and generally own the property where our towers and primary transmitters are located 
we lease the remaining properties  consisting primarily of sales office locations and microwave transmitter sites 
while none of the station properties owned or leased by us are individually material to our operations  if we were required to relocate any of our towers  the cost could be significant 
this is because the number of sites in any geographic area that permit a tower of reasonable height to provide good coverage of the market is limited  and zoning and other land use restrictions  as well as federal aviation administration and fcc regulations  limit the number of alternative locations or increase the cost of acquiring them for tower sites

executive summary we own and operate and or program television stations in mid sized markets 
our operating revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  national and political advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from digital revenues  network compensation  barter and other revenues 
during  economic conditions continued to adversely impact local and national advertising across all of our markets 
we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net loss of million and net income of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net income of million for the year ended december  included a a pre tax gain on early extinguishment of debt of million related to our purchase of a portion of our senior subordinated notes  and b a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million related to our broadcast licenses and goodwill recorded during the second quarter of  as further described in note intangible assets 
our operating highlights for include the following total revenues decreased million compared to  primarily due to a decline in political revenues of million in as a result of the presidential  congressional  state and local elections that took place during the decrease in revenue in also reflected the television advertising marketplace decline in our local markets resulting from the economic downturn 
advertising categories for which local and national advertising sales decreased for compared to were automotive  retail  restaurants  media telecommunications  services  financial services and entertainment 
advertising categories for which revenues increased for included grocery and food items  home improvement and health and beauty 
as a result of declines in the demand for automobiles during and the related restructurings in the automobile industry  automotive advertising declines exceeded declines we experienced in other advertising categories 
the automotive category  which represented of our local and national advertising sales for  decreased by compared to  during which the automotive category represented of our local and national advertising sales 
however  in the fourth quarter of  automotive advertising increased by as compared to the same period in during both the fourth quarter of and automotive advertising represented of our local and national advertising sales 
during the latter half of the fourth quarter of  we began to experience increases in our national and local advertising revenues as a result of modest recovery in advertising spending when compared to we anticipate continued modest recovery during and increases in advertising spending as a result of the olympics and congressional  state and local elections 

table of contents operating expenses decreased approximately billion compared to primarily as a result of the billion impairment charge recorded during additionally  direct operating  selling  general and administrative and corporate expenses decreased million  million and million  respectively  compared to primarily as a result of cost savings realized from the restructuring initiatives implemented during and during the year ended december   we purchased a total principal amount of million and million of our senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes class b  respectively  at market prices using available balances under our revolving credit facility and available cash balances 
the total purchase price for the transactions was million  resulting in a pre tax gain on extinguishment of debt of million  net of a write off of deferred financing fees and discount related to the notes of million 
during the six months ended june   we experienced declines in revenues compared to the same periods in  which were in excess of our original plan 
as a result  and to address continued compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreement  on july  we entered into the amended credit agreement 
under the amended credit agreement  our aggregate revolving credit commitments remained at million and our outstanding term loans remained at the july  balance of million 
the amended credit agreement revised the company s financial covenants  tightened exceptions to certain of the negative covenants  increased the interest rates and fees payable on borrowings  and provided the lenders with additional collateral 
for further information on the amended credit agreement see description of indebtedness 
on october   we completed the acquisition of rmm  an online advertising and media services company based in austin  texas 
this acquisition significantly expands our local multi platform offerings by providing national advertising and enhanced services  including targeted display  rich media  video advertising  custom built vertical channels  search engine marketing  search engine optimization  and mobile marketing 
we believe this acquisition will further diversify and augment our digital marketing and sales business  as well as provide new opportunities for growth 
our joint venture with nbc universal continues to be adversely impacted by the recent economic downturn 
as described in item  business our joint venture with nbc universal  on march  we and nbc universal entered into the shortfall funding agreement through april   on terms substantially the same as the original shortfall funding agreement 
during the year ended december   we accrued a total of million for our probable and estimable obligations under both the original and shortfall funding agreements relating to our joint venture with nbc universal 
in part because of changes in the timing of working capital needs at the joint venture stations  as of march   we have not yet provided any funding under these agreements 
however  as of march   this million liability continues to reflect our best estimate of probable obligations under the original shortfall funding agreement and shortfall funding agreement 

table of contents critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements certain of our accounting policies  as well as estimates we make  are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations since they are particularly sensitive to our judgment 
some of these policies and estimates relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the estimates and judgments we make affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets and goodwill  receivables and investments  program rights  income taxes  stock based compensation  employee medical insurance claims  pensions  useful lives of property and equipment  contingencies  barter transactions  acquired asset valuations and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and it is possible that such differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about these and other accounting policies  see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have discussed each of these critical accounting policies and related estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets approximately million or of our total assets as of december  consisted of indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our broadcast licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of broadcast licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario 
the future value of our broadcast licenses could be significantly impaired by the loss of the corresponding network affiliation agreements 
accordingly  such an event could trigger an assessment of the carrying value of a broadcast license 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a station with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a station is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the station and prevailing values in the markets for broadcasting properties 
if the fair value of the station exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the station exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation  using the station s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  but not more than the carrying value of the goodwill 
an impairment assessment could be triggered by a significant reduction  or a forecast of such reductions  in operating results or cash flows at one or more of our television stations  a significant adverse change in the national or local advertising marketplaces in which our television stations operate  or by adverse changes to fcc ownership rules  among other factors 

table of contents the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our own internal business plans as well as future expectations about general economic and local market conditions 
the changes in the discount rate used for our broadcast licenses and goodwill reflected in the table below are primarily driven by changes in the average beta for the public equity of companies in the television and media sector and the average cost of capital in each of the periods 
the changes in the market growth rates and operating profit margins for both our broadcast licenses and goodwill reflect changes in the outlook for advertising revenues in certain markets where our stations operate in each of the periods 
we based the valuation of broadcast licenses on the following average industry based assumptions december  june  december  june  december  market revenue growth operating profit margins discount rate tax rate capitalization rate as of december   we would not incur an impairment of our broadcast licenses if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by  decrease the operating profit margins by from the projected operating profit margins  or increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by 
the valuation of goodwill is based on the following assumptions  which take into account our internal projections and industry assumptions related to market revenue growth  operating cash flows and prevailing discount rates december  june  december  june  december  market revenue growth operating profit margins discount rate tax rate capitalization rate as of december   if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by and by of the projected growth rate  the enterprise value of our stations with goodwill would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the operating profit margins by and from the projected operating profit margins  the enterprise value of our stations with goodwill would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by and  the enterprise value of our stations with goodwill would decrease by million and million  respectively 

table of contents network affiliations other broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets by these broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market  the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting 
television stations that have been broadcasting since the late s are viewed more often than newer television stations  the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within a market ie the value of being licensed in the smallest city within a tri city market has less value than being licensed in the largest city  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station 
the local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its network programming  and the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndicated programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 
a local television station can be the top rated station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on the factors or attributes listed above 
abc  cbs  fox and nbc  each have affiliations with local television stations that have the largest primetime audience in the local market in which the station operates regardless of the network s primetime rating 
some broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are the most important component of the value of a station 
these companies generally believe that television stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all our markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to our television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all our markets in which we operate beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 

table of contents in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different facts and circumstances for each station and market being evaluated 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such a determination was made 
revenue recognition we recognize advertising and other program related revenue during the period in which advertising or programs are aired on our television stations or carried by our internet web sites or the web sites of our advertiser network 
we recognize retransmission consent fees in the period in which our service is delivered 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using a black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables to be assumed in the calculation  including the option s expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
price volatility is based on historical trends for our class a common stock and the common stock of peer group companies engaged in the broadcasting business 
expected forfeitures are estimated using our historical experience 
if future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  our future stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents retirement plan we have historically provided a defined benefit retirement plan to our employees who did not receive matching contributions from our company to their k plan accounts 
our pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts 
our defined benefit plan is a non contributory plan under which we may make contributions either to a traditional plan participants based on periodic actuarial valuations  which are expensed over the expected average remaining service lives of current employees  or b cash balance plan participants based on of each participant s eligible compensation 
effective april   this plan was frozen and we do not expect to make additional benefit accruals to this plan 
as a result of this action  during the year ended december   we recorded a net curtailment gain that included a million charge related to prior service cost and a gain to our projected benefit obligation of million as a result of the reduction of future compensation increases 
we contributed million to our pension plan during the year ended december  and million in each of years ended december  and we anticipate contributing approximately million to our pension plan in although we currently have no minimum funding requirements as defined by erisa and federal tax laws 
pension plan assumptions weighted average assumptions used to estimate our pension benefit obligations and to determine our net periodic pension benefit cost  and the actual long term rate of return on plan assets are as follows year ended december  discount rate used to estimate our pension benefit obligation discount rate used to determine net periodic pension benefit rate of compensation increase expected long term rate of return plan assets actual long term rate of return on plan assets we used the citigroup pension discount curve to aid in the selection of our discount rate  which we believe reflects the weighted rate of a theoretical high quality bond portfolio consistent with the duration of the cash flows related to our pension liability 
we considered the current levels of expected returns on a risk free investment  the historical levels of risk premium associated with each of our pension asset classes  the expected future returns for each of our pension asset classes and then weighted each asset class based on our pension plan asset allocation to derive an expected long term return on pension plan assets 
during the year ended december   our actual long term rate of return on plan assets was 
as a result of the plan freeze during  we have no further service cost or amortization of prior service cost related to the plan 
in addition  because the plan is now frozen and participants became inactive during  the net losses related to the plan included in accumulated other comprehensive income will now be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants instead of the average remaining service period 
for these reasons  our expense is expected to be approximately thousand  which is significantly less than in prior periods 
for every change in the actual return compared to the expected long term return on pension plan assets and for every change in the actual discount rate compared to the discount rate assumption for  our pension expense would change by less than million 

table of contents our investment objective is to achieve a consistent total rate of return that will equal or exceed our actuarial assumptions and to equal or exceed the benchmarks that we use for each of our pension plan asset classes including the s p index  s p mid cap index  russell index  msci eafe index and the lehman brothers aggregate bond index 
the following asset allocation is designed to create a diversified portfolio of pension plan assets that is consistent with our target asset allocation and risk policy target allocation percentage of plan assets at december  asset category equity securities debt securities our actual allocation of plan assets for is not in range of our target allocation in an effort to realize potential gains associated with the equity market rebound 
during late  our retirement committee decided to set the target allocation at equity securities and debt securities 
beginning in  the funds in our plan will be rebalanced on a quarterly basis in line with this new allocation 
we continue to monitor the performance of these funds and anticipate the allocation moving in line with the target as the economic outlook stabilizes

table of contents gain loss on derivative instruments increased million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  compared to their respective prior year periods due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
during  our derivative instrument consisted of an interest rate hedge agreement entered into during the second quarter of to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with notional amount of the declining balances of our term loans  which effectively converted the floating rate libor based payments under this portion of the facility to fixed payments

our recorded provision for income tax of million for the year ended december  represents an effective tax rate of compared to a benefit from income tax of million for the year ended december   which represents an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of various state law changes on our effective tax rate

the outstanding debt under our credit facility is due november  and all of our senior subordinated notes are due may  as of december   the total fair value of our outstanding debt was million 
our operating plan for the next months requires that we generate cash from operations  utilize available borrowings  and make certain debt repayments  including mandatory repayments of term loans under our credit facility 
our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is contingent on our compliance with certain financial covenants  which are measured  in part  by the level of earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda we generate from our operations 
during the six months ended june   we experienced declines in revenues compared to the same periods in which were in excess of our original plan 
as a result  and to address continued compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreement  on july  we entered into the amended credit agreement 
for further information regarding the terms of the amended credit agreement see description of indebtedness 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants in the amended credit agreement 

table of contents our ability to generate cash from operations and from borrowings under our credit facility could be affected by  but is not limited to  the following factors the economic downturn  which has adversely affected local and national advertising revenues across all of our stations  with local advertising revenues decreasing for the year ended december  as compared to  and national advertising revenues decreasing for the year ended december  as compared to approximately  and of our net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from local and national advertising 
we anticipate a modest recovery during as the us economy emerges from recession  but there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the seasonality of the broadcast business  due primarily to political advertising revenues occurring in even years  which will result in increased political advertising revenues in political advertising revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
economic and credit market conditions can impact our advertisers ability to pay for advertising and the timing of those payments 
during  despite the economic downturn  we did not experience significant deterioration in the collectability of our outstanding receivables 
we have evaluated our receivables due from customers who are experiencing financial difficulty  and the net realizable value of those receivables is not material to our financial position as of december  our days sales outstanding as of the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
we experienced an improvement in days sales outstanding during and as a result of our centralization of credit and collection functions in and the resulting on going improvement in our collections function 
volatility in the equity markets impacts the fair value of our pension plan assets and ultimately the cash funding requirements of our pension plan 
as of december   the fair value of our pension plan assets was million compared to million as of december  in order to manage our liquidity  we contributed million to our pension plan during we anticipate contributing million to our pension plan during additionally  effective january   we resumed company contributions to the k plan  whereby the company will provide a non elective contribution to all eligible employees 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our k plan during we are exposed to potential losses related to fluctuations in interest rates 
borrowings under our credit facility bear an interest rate based on  at our option  either a the libor interest rate  or b the abr rate  which is an interest rate that is equal to the greatest of i the prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus of percent  and iii the one month libor rate plus 
in addition  the rate we select also bears an applicable margin rate of or for libor based loans and abr rate loans  respectively 
to mitigate changes in our cash flows resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  we entered into the interest rate hedge that effectively converted the floating rate libor rate based payments on our term loan to fixed payments at plus the applicable margin rate calculated under our credit facility  which expires in our senior subordinated notes bear a fixed interest rate of 

table of contents cash requirements related to the nbc universal joint venture our joint venture with nbc universal has been adversely impacted by the current economic downturn 
the joint venture distributed no cash to nbc universal and us during the year ended december  although the joint venture distributed cash to nbc universal and us in the amount of million and million for the years ended december  and  the cash distributions for included nonrecurring cash proceeds of million from the sale of broadcast towers 
in light of the adverse effect of the economic downturn on the joint venture s operating results  in we entered into the original shortfall funding agreement with nbc universal  which provided that a we and nbc waived the requirement that the joint venture maintain debt service reserve cash balances of at least million  b the joint venture would use a portion of its existing debt service reserve cash balances to fund interest payments in  c nbc agreed to defer its receipt of and management fees  and d we agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to fund interest payments on the gecc note through april   we and nbc universal would each provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
during the year ended december   the joint venture used approximately million of the existing debt service cash reserves  leaving approximately million available 
as of march   we have not yet provided any funding under the original shortfall funding agreement 
because of anticipated future shortfalls at the joint venture  on march   nbc universal and we entered into the shortfall funding agreement covering the period through april  under the terms of the shortfall funding agreement a the joint venture may continue to access any portion of its existing debt service reserve cash balances to fund interest payments  b nbc will continue to defer the payment of and management fees and will defer payment of management fees through march  payable subject to repayment first of any joint venture shortfall loans  and c we agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to fund interest payments on the gecc note through april   we and nbc universal would each provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
the timing of anticipated debt service shortfalls at the joint venture is affected by the levels of working capital at the stations owned by the joint venture and their anticipated uses of working capital to fund operations and to distribute cash to the joint venture for the purpose of servicing the interest expense on the gecc note 
we recognize liabilities under the original shortfall funding agreement and the shortfall funding agreement when those liabilities become both probable and estimable  which result when joint venture management provides us with budget or forecast information of operating cash flows and working capital needs indicating that a debt service shortfall is probable to occur 

table of contents during  joint venture management provided us a revised outlook for after each quarter end  which  as of september   resulted in an accrual of million for our probable and estimable obligations under the original shortfall funding agreement through the april  expiry of that agreement 
due to uncertainty surrounding the joint venture s ability to repay the shortfall loan  we concurrently impaired the loan as of september  based on our latest estimate of cash flow requirements of the joint venture through april   our share of the estimated shortfall through april  is million  of which million was accrued as of september  subsequent to september   we a received the joint venture s budget and b as noted above  entered into the shortfall funding agreement to cover debt service shortfalls through april  based on the budget provided by the joint venture  and our discussions with the joint venture s management  we believe there will be an additional debt service shortfall at the joint venture from april  through april  of million to million  of which  our share of the shortfall could be approximately million 
as a result  we have accrued our portion of the estimated shortfalls through april   bringing the total accrual for our joint venture shortfall obligations to million as of december  due to uncertainty surrounding the joint venture s ability to repay the shortfall loans  we concurrently impaired all accrued loans to the joint venture as of december  this amount reflects our probable and estimable obligations through the expiration of the shortfall funding agreement on april  we do not believe our funding obligations related to the joint venture  if any  beyond april  are currently probable and estimable  therefore  we have not accrued for any potential obligations beyond the million discussed above 
however  our actual cash shortfall funding could exceed our estimate 
as of march   we have not yet provided any funding under either of these agreements 
we expect to fund our million share of shortfall liabilities under the original shortfall funding agreement during the first quarter of  and the remaining million amount through the period ending april  we do not believe our funding obligations related to the joint venture  if any  beyond april  are currently estimable and probable  therefore  we have not accrued for any potential obligations beyond the million discussed above 
however  our actual cash shortfall funding could exceed our estimate 
our ability to honor our shortfall loan obligations under the original shortfall funding agreement and the shortfall funding agreement is subject to compliance with restrictions under our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes 
based on the budget provided by joint venture management  and our forecast of total leverage and consolidated ebitda during and  we expect to have the capacity within these restrictions to provide shortfall funding under the shortfall funding agreement in proportion to our approximately percent economic interest in the joint venture through the april  expiration of the shortfall funding agreement 
however  there can be no assurance that we will have the capacity to provide such funding 
if we are required to fund a portion of a shortfall loan  we plan to use our available cash balances or available borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  if the joint venture experiences further cash shortfalls beyond april   we may decide to fund such cash shortfalls  or to fund such shortfalls through further loans or equity contributions to the joint venture 
if we are unable to make payments under the original shortfall funding agreement or the shortfall funding agreement  the joint venture may be unable to fund interest obligations under the gecc note  resulting in an event of default 
an event of default under the gecc note will occur if the joint venture fails to make any scheduled interest payment within days of the date due and payable  or to pay the principal amount on the maturity date 
if the joint venture fails to pay interest on the gecc note  and neither nbc universal nor we make a shortfall loan to fund the interest payment within days of the date due and payable  an event of default would occur and gecc could accelerate the maturity of the entire amount due under the gecc note 
other than the acceleration of the principal amount upon an event of default  prepayment of the principal of the note is prohibited unless agreed upon by both nbc universal and us 
upon an event of default under the gecc note  gecc s only recourse is to the joint venture  our equity interest in the joint venture and  after exhausting all remedies against the assets of the joint venture and the other equity interests in the joint venture  to lin tv pursuant to its guarantee of the gecc note 

table of contents under the terms of its guarantee of the gecc note  lin tv would be required to make a payment for an amount to be determined upon occurrence of the following events a there is an event of default  b neither nbc universal or us remedy the default  and c after gecc exhausts all remedies against the assets of the joint venture  the total amount realized upon exercise of those remedies is less than the million principal amount of the gecc note 
upon the occurrence of such events  the amount owed by lin tv to gecc pursuant to the guarantee would be calculated as the difference between i the total amount at which the joint venture s assets were sold and ii the principal amount and any unpaid interest due under the gecc note 
as of december   we estimate the fair value of the television stations in the joint venture to be approximately million less than the outstanding balance of the gecc note of million 
although we believe the probability is remote that there would be an event of default and therefore an acceleration of the principal amount of the gecc note during  there can be no assurances that such an event of default will not occur 
there are no financial or similar covenants in the gecc note and  since both nbc universal and we have agreed to fund interest payments through april  if the joint venture is unable to do so  nbc universal and we are able to control the occurrence of a default under the gecc note 
factors affecting liquidity in and outlook during the year ended december   we completed a purchase of a portion of our senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes class b at market prices using available balances under our revolving credit facility and available cash balances 
during the year ended december   we purchased a total principal amount of million and million of our senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes class b  respectively 
for further information see description of indebtedness 
we completed a restructuring during the second quarter of that included the consolidation of certain activities at our stations that resulted in the termination of employees 
we anticipate savings of approximately million per year from this restructuring  however  if our operational needs change during the year we may not be able to realize all of these savings 
we are using our strong local television station brands and considerable news  sports  weather  traffic and other local video content to develop new revenue streams 
these new revenues are generated by our television station web sites  the launch of our mobile telephone and smart phone applications  the acquisition of rmm and scheduled increases in retransmission consent fees 
our digital revenues increased or million for the year ended december   compared to prior year 
we anticipate spending of approximately million on capital expenditures during primarily for broadcast and related equipment  compared to capital expenditures of approximately million during additional spending may be required for any unplanned major repairs for equipment failures 
on april   our banks broadcasting joint venture completed the sale of knin tv  a cw affiliate in boise  for million to journal broadcast corporation 
as a result of the sale we received  on the basis of our economic interest in banks broadcasting  a distribution of million during the quarter ended june  we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately million during the second quarter of from amounts held in escrow at the expiration of a one year indemnity period 

table of contents we have also assessed the impact the current market conditions could have on third parties with whom we do business  specifically as it relates to our interest rate hedge and insurance contracts 
management performs a quarterly assessment of the critical terms of the interest rate hedge including  among other matters  an assessment of the counterparties creditworthiness 
based on our assessment at december   we do not believe there is a significant risk associated with the creditworthiness of our interest rate hedge counterparty 
given current economic conditions  management also reviewed the insurance contracts associated with our facilities and business continuity insurance providers and noted no material credit risks
