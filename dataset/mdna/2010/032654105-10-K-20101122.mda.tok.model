during the first quarter of fiscal  we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations  or baseband chipset business  to mediatek inc and sold our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation 
the financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
the assets related to these businesses are reflected as non current assets of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet as of october  unless otherwise noted  this management s discussion and analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations 
results of operations overview fiscal year revenue gross margin net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations as a of revenue diluted eps from continuing operations diluted eps the year to year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market and revenue trends by product 
in fiscal  our revenue increased from fiscal and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from to 
cash flow from operations in fiscal was million  or of revenue 
in addition  we received million in net proceeds related to employee stock option exercises  
table of contents distributed million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid million for capital expenditures 
these factors contributed to the net increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million in fiscal the year to year increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal was the result of a resurgence in economic activity from the low levels achieved during as a result of the general economic downturn following the global credit and financial crisis 
the strategy we employed during the start of the economic downturn to be more focused on products and markets that value innovation and to make fundamental improvements to our cost structure aided in our growth 
improving macro trends in the industrial  communications  automotive and healthcare markets helped  and we believe will continue to help  to generate strong growth opportunities for us in the future 
however  these trends remain uncertain and we cannot predict the sustainability of the current economic conditions 
consequently  our reported results for fiscal may not be indicative of our future results 
revenue trends by end market the following table summarizes revenue by end market 
the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product  the sold to customer information  the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated 
as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve  the categorization of products by end market can vary over time 
when this occurs  we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods 
such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of  or the underlying trends of results within  each end market 
of of of total total total product product product revenue revenue y y revenue revenue revenue revenue industrial automotive consumer communications computer total revenue the sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding 
industrial the year to year increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand in this end market  which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors 
the year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based decline in demand in this end market  which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and process controls sectors 
automotive the year to year increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of increased demand due to various government initiated incentive programs  inventory replenishment and a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles 
the year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in automotive end market revenue was primarily due to economic conditions relating to the global credit crisis resulting in cautious customer spending behavior 
consumer the year to year increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand for products used in digital cameras and other consumer applications 
the year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment  digital cameras and video game applications  consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending 

table of contents communications the year to year increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand in this end market  which was most significant for the infrastructure sector 
the year to year decrease from fiscal to fiscal in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of analog products used in basestations  wireless handsets and networking applications 
revenue trends by product the following table summarizes revenue by product categories 
the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products  the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications 
the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time 
in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods 
such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of  or the underlying trends of results within  each product category 
of of of total total total product product product revenue revenue y y revenue revenue revenue revenue converters amplifiers radio frequency other analog subtotal analog signal processing power management reference total analog products digital signal processing total revenue the sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding 
the increase in total revenue from fiscal to fiscal was the result of a broad based increase in sales across all of our product categories 
the decrease in revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to declining demand across our product categories in every market that we serve  particularly the industrial and consumer end markets  as a result of an overall decline in the worldwide economy 
revenue trends by geographic region the percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region  based upon point of sale  for the last three fiscal years is as follows fiscal year region united states rest of north and south america europe japan china rest of asia 
table of contents in fiscal year and  the predominant countries comprising rest of north and south america are canada and mexico  the predominant countries comprising europe are germany  sweden  france and the united kingdom  and the predominant countries comprising rest of asia are taiwan  south korea and singapore 
in fiscal year  the predominant countries comprising rest of north and south america are canada and mexico  the predominant countries comprising europe are germany  france and the united kingdom  and the predominant countries comprising rest of asia are taiwan and south korea 
sales increased in all geographic regions in fiscal as compared to fiscal  with sales in europe and the rest of asia experiencing the largest increases 
the increase in sales was the result of an increase in demand for our products primarily as a result of improving economic conditions worldwide 
sales declined in all geographic regions in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  with sales in europe and japan experiencing the largest decline 
this decline in sales in europe was partially attributable to a decline in the automotive end market 
the decline in sales in japan was principally attributable to the general decline in consumer spending as a result of the global economic crisis 
the decline in china was smaller than the decline in the other regions primarily due to the strong demand for our products used in china s recent infrastructure build out of the country s next generation of communication technology 
gross margin fiscal year gross margin gross margin gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal by basis points as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in sales of million  increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of ongoing efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs  including the savings realized as a result of wafer fabrication facility consolidations 
additionally  a higher proportion of our revenues was from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market  which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets 
gross margin percentage was lower in fiscal by basis points as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of million and reduced operating levels in our manufacturing facilities that created adverse utilization variances 
research and development r d fiscal year r d expenses r d expenses as a of revenue research and development  or r d  expenses in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense  which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability  partially offset by the impact of actions we took over the past two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses 
r d expenses in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of the actions we took to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses 
r d expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts  which we view as critical to our future growth 
at any point in time we have hundreds of r d projects underway  and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis 
we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products  and we believe that a continued commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our 
table of contents existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant r d investments in the future 
selling  marketing  general and administrative smg a fiscal year smg a expenses smg a expenses as a of revenue selling  marketing  general and administrative  or smg a  expenses in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense  which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability  and higher sales commission expenses  which are variable expenses linked to our sales 
these increases were offset by the impact of actions we took over the past two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses 
smg a expenses in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of our actions taken to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses 
stock based compensation expense as of october   the total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized in our statement of income was approximately million before tax consideration  which we will recognize over a weighted average period of years 
during fiscal  our shareholders approved and we completed an employee stock option exchange program option exchange 
the option exchange provided our eligible employees  excluding our named executive officers and directors  the opportunity to exchange eligible stock option grants for a smaller number of new stock options with a lower exercise price  or in some instances cash  that had approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information on our stock based compensation 
special charges the following is a summary of ongoing restructuring actions we have taken over the last several years 
closure of wafer fabrication facility in sunnyvale we ceased production at our california wafer fabrication facility in november we paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term  which expired in march we recorded a one time settlement charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal related to the termination of the lease 
this action was completed in fiscal consolidation of a wafer fabrication facility in limerick in fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of our decision to only use eight inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in limerick 
certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the limerick facility s six inch production line have transitioned to our existing eight inch production line in limerick while others have transitioned to external foundries 
the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for manufacturing employees associated with this action 
we terminated the employment of all employees associated with these programs and have paid out all amounts owed to employees as severance 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional charge of million related to this action  of which million was an adjustment to the original estimate of the severance costs and million was for clean up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred 
during fiscal  we recorded additional charges of 
table of contents million for clean up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred 
the production in the six inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal this action was completed in fiscal the closure of this facility resulted in annual cost savings of approximately million per year  which we began realizing in the first quarter of fiscal these savings are recorded in cost of sales  of which approximately million relates to non cash depreciation savings 
reduction of operating costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in order to further reduce our operating cost structure  we recorded a special charge of million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or the statutory requirements at foreign locations for engineering  selling  marketing  general and administrative employees 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional charge of million related to this cost reduction action 
approximately million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal  approximately million was for the write off of property  plant and equipment no longer used as a result of this action  and approximately million was for contract termination costs and approximately million was for clean up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred 
the remaining million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for manufacturing employees and engineering and smg a employees 
this cost reduction action  which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal  resulted in annual savings of approximately million 
these annual savings are being realized as follows approximately million in smg a expenses and approximately million in cost of sales 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional charge of million related to the further reduction of our operating cost structure 
approximately million of this charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for engineering and smg a employees 
approximately million of the charge relates to our decision to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in power management  resulting in the impairment of related intellectual property 
when fully implemented in the first quarter of fiscal  we estimate that these cost reduction actions will result in annual savings of approximately million 
we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance 
closure of a wafer fabrication facility in cambridge during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of our decision to consolidate our cambridge  massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing wilmington  massachusetts facility 
in connection with the anticipated closure of this facility  we evaluated the recoverability of the facility s manufacturing assets and concluded that there was an impairment of approximately million based on the revised period of intended use 
the remaining million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for manufacturing employees and smg a employees associated with this action 
we finished production in the cambridge wafer fabrication facility and began clean up activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal we reversed approximately million of our severance accrual 
the accrual reversal was required because employees either voluntarily left the company or found alternative employment within the company 
in addition  we recorded a special charge of approximately million for the impairment of manufacturing assets that were originally going to be moved to our other wafer fabrication facilities but are no longer needed at those facilities and therefore have no future use 
we also recorded a special charge of million for clean up costs as we began our clean up of the cambridge wafer fabrication facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this charge and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance 
we estimate that this action will result in annual cost savings of approximately million per year  which we began realizing in the third quarter of fiscal we expect these annual savings to be realized as follows approximately million 
table of contents in cost of sales  of which approximately million relates to non cash depreciation savings  and approximately million relates to smg a expenses 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional charge of million related to this cost reduction action 
approximately million of the charge related to lease obligation costs for the cambridge wafer fabrication facility  which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal  and the remaining million of the charge related to clean up and closure costs 
these cost reductions resulted in annual savings of approximately million  which we began realizing in the first quarter of fiscal operating income from continuing operations fiscal year operating income from continuing operations operating income from continuing operations as a of revenue the million  or  increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of million  a basis point increase in gross margin percentage  and lower special charges recorded in fiscal as compared to fiscal the million  or  decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of million  a basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase of million in special charges 
this decrease in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a decrease in r d and smg a expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling  marketing  general and administrative 
nonoperating income expense fiscal year interest expense interest income other  net total nonoperating income nonoperating income was lower by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher interest expense incurred during fiscal as a result of the issuance of million aggregate principal senior unsecured notes on june  resulting in a partial year of interest expense in compared to a full year in in addition  we earned lower interest income on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal nonoperating income was lower by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower interest income earned on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  we incurred interest expense during fiscal as a result of the issuance of million aggregate principal senior unsecured notes on june  we entered into an interest rate swap in june that swaps the fixed rate of the notes to a variable rate based on the three month libor plus 
provision for income taxes fiscal year provision for income taxes effective income tax rate 
table of contents our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was higher compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate 
in addition  higher special charges recorded in fiscal  a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher us tax rate contributed to a higher effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was lower compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal primarily as a result of our recording special charges of million in fiscal  a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher us tax rate  and as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a lower rate 
income from continuing operations  net of tax fiscal year income from continuing operations  net of tax income from continuing operations  net of tax as a of revenue diluted eps from continuing operations income from continuing operations  net of tax  in fiscal was higher than in fiscal by approximately million primarily as a result of the million increase in operating income that was partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal income from continuing operations  net of tax  in fiscal was lower than in fiscal by approximately million primarily as a result of the million decrease in operating income that was partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
discontinued operations fiscal year income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax total income from discontinued operations  net of tax diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal accordingly  the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions in fiscal  we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately held integrant technologies  inc integrant of seoul  korea 
the acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile tv market and strengthened our presence in the asia region 
we paid million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of integrant during the period from july through july we recorded these payments as additional goodwill 
in fiscal  we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately held audioasics a s audioasics of roskilde  denmark 
the acquisition of audioasics allows us to continue developing low power audio solutions  while expanding our presence in the nordic and eastern european regions 
we paid additional cash payments of 
table of contents million during fiscal for the achievement of revenue based milestones during the period from october through january  which we recorded as additional goodwill 
in addition  in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents  we paid million during fiscal based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from october through january  which we recorded as compensation expense in fiscal all revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisition have been met and no additional payments will be made 
we have not provided pro forma results of operations for integrant and audioasics in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis 
we included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal year net cash provided by operations net cash provided by operations as a of revenue at october   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  million  an increase of million from the fourth quarter of fiscal the primary sources of funds for fiscal were net cash generated from operating activities of million and million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
the principal uses of funds for fiscal were dividend payments of million and capital expenditures of million 
we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal the cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating  investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations ie no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations has not and will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position 
additionally  as a result of these dispositions  we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations 
see note u 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding these discontinued operations 
fiscal year accounts receivable days sales outstanding inventory days cost of sales in inventory we use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory 
accounts receivable at october  increased million  or  from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in receivables was the result of higher revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal inventory at october  increased by million  or  from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in inventory relates primarily to an increase in manufacturing production to support higher sales demand 
current liabilities increased to million at october   an increase of million  or  from million at the end of fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher deferred income on shipments to distributors in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and an increase in accrued liabilities relating to variable 
table of contents compensation expense 
in addition  income taxes payable increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of higher profits and a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate 
net additions to property  plant and equipment including discontinued operations were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
during fiscal  our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of million 
after the end of fiscal  on november   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of our common stock 
the dividend is payable on december  to shareholders of record on december  and is expected to total approximately million 
we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at per share  although they remain subject to declaration by our board of directors 
the payment of future dividends  if any  will be based on several factors  including our financial performance  outlook and liquidity 
our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august in the aggregate  the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase billion of our common stock under the program 
under the program  we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors  the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program 
as of october   we had repurchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately  million under this program 
as of october   an additional million remained available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program 
on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional billion of our common stock under our existing share repurchase program 
the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock 
we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options  or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans 
any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance  outlook  liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the united states 
on june   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due july  the notes with annual interest payments of paid in two installments on january and july of each year  commencing january  the net proceeds of the offering were million  after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions  which will be amortized over the term of the notes 
we swapped the fixed interest portion of these notes for a variable interest rate based on the three month libor plus as of october  
the variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly 
the libor based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment 
the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to incur  create  assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property  enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to a principal property  and consolidate with or merge into  or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party 
in addition  we have a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may to date  we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance  stock repurchases  dividend payments  acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and other lawful corporate purposes 
at october   our principal source of liquidity was  million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of october   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held in the united states 
the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries 
as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely  this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states  including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases 
the volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets 
while there are signs that conditions may be improving  there is no certainty that the current tentative recovery in credit and financial markets will continue 
we are unable to predict the likely duration of the tentative 
table of contents recovery in the credit and financial markets 
however  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with existing and anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  research and development efforts  dividend payments if any and purchases of stock if any under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of october  payment due by period less than more than thousands total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases a long term debt obligations interest payments associated with long term debt obligations b payments due under interest rate swap agreements c deferred compensation plan d pension funding e total a certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses 
these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 
b these interest payments are expected to be offset by the proceeds from our interest rate swap agreements 
c these interest payments are based on a variable interest rate based on the three month libor plus 
the actual payments will be based on the libor based rate which is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payments plus 
d these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation 
the amount in the more than years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment 
since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the more than years column of the table 
e our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country 
the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance  interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
in addition  our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements 
as of october   our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was million  which are included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item of this annual report on form k 
due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain 
table of contents tax positions 
therefore  we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october  off balance sheet financing as of october   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
outlook the following statements are based on current expectations

we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policy for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user  however  the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value 
we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory 
while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
to date  our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates  and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  when appropriate  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
to date  our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates  and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 
long lived assets we review property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be 
table of contents recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property  plant  and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain instances  assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased 
in these situations  we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 
goodwill goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies  which requires significant judgment by management 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made  which in turn  may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
on november  the first day of our fiscal year  we adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions 
these principles requires companies to determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on 
table of contents factors including  but not limited to  changes in known facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition to the factors described above  our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then current tax law 
significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market s current expectations of future volatility 
in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility  we concluded that options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges  the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options  the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options  and the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 
expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the black scholes grant date valuation 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 
in general  the longer the expected term used in the black scholes valuation model  the higher the grant date fair value of the option 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
expected dividend yield expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option 
until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter s cash dividend  the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption 
cash dividends are not paid on options  restricted stock or restricted stock units 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested stock based awards as of october  the rate of represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

table of contents contingencies from time to time  we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  we record a contingent loss 
in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of october  and october   our annual interest income would change by approximately million and million  respectively  for each basis point increase in interest rates 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of october   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of october   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in approximately million of incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 
in june  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our million senior unsecured notes due july  the effect of the swap was to convert our fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three month libor plus as of october  
if libor changes by basis points  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million 
foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note i 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months 
currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro  primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october  and october   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately million in losses in earnings or cash flows 
the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions  assets and liabilities being hedged 
the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings 
we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties 
while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions  they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk 
the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

table of contents the following table illustrates the effect that a unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates  relative to the us dollar  would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october  and october  october  october  fair value of forward exchange contracts asset fair value of forward exchange contracts after a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset fair value of forward exchange contracts after a favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices
