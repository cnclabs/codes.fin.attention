regulation and other factors overview the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws  regulations and rules including among others those related to government healthcare participation requirements  various licensure and accreditations  reimbursement for patient services  health information privacy and security rules  and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse provisions including  but not limited to  federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources  false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self referrals by physicians 
providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs  subjected to significant fines or penalties and or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services 
although we believe our policies  procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations  no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions  or that we would not be faced with sanctions  fines or penalties if so subjected 
even if we were to ultimately prevail  a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws  regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us 
licensing  certification and accreditation all of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal  state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care  equipment and cleanliness 
our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal  state and local health agencies  as well as the requirements of municipal building codes  health codes and local fire departments 
various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
all our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the joint commission 
all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare and medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
if any of our facilities were to lose its joint commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the medicare and medicaid programs  the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the medicare and medicaid programs and other payors 
although we believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal  state  local and independent review body regulations and standards  please see item a 
risk factors on page of this report for disclosure regarding ongoing matters with the centers for medicare and medicaid services in connection with our two rivers psychiatric hospital and southwest healthcare system 
the requirements for licensure  certification and accreditation are subject to change and  in order to remain qualified  it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel and services in the future  which could have a material adverse impact on operations 
certificates of need many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures  construction  expansion  modernization or initiation of major new services 
failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition  expansion or replacement  the imposition of civil or  in some cases  criminal sanctions  the inability to receive medicare or medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility s license  which could harm our business 
in addition  significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements 
in the past  we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements  but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations 

table of contents conversion legislation many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not for profit hospitals to for profit entities 
these laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions 
although the level of government involvement varies from state to state  the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and  in some cases  approval of a transaction in which a not for profit entity sells a health care facility to a for profit entity 
the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not for profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not for profit hospitals 
utilization review federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by medicare and medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services 
the law and regulations require peer review organizations pros to review the appropriateness of medicare and medicaid patient admissions and discharges  the quality of care provided  the validity of diagnosis related group drg classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay 
pros may deny payment for services provided  assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the department of health and human services hhs that a provider that is in substantial non compliance with the standards of the pro be excluded from participating in the medicare program 
we have contracted with pros in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews 
self referral and anti kickback legislation the stark law the social security act includes a provision commonly known as the stark law 
this law prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship  unless an exception is met 
these types of referrals are known as self referrals 
sanctions for violating the stark law include civil penalties up to  for each violation  up to  for sham arrangements  up to  for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs 
there are a number of exceptions to the self referral prohibition  including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit  service or subpart 
there are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers  including employment contracts  leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements 
we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
nonetheless because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving  there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the stark law 
anti kickback statute a provision of the social security act known as the anti kickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting  receiving  offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using  referring  ordering  recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program 
the anti kickback statute contains certain exceptions  and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services oig has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors  from the federal anti kickback statute for various activities 
these activities  which must meet certain requirements  include but are not limited to the following investment interests  space rental  equipment rental  practitioner recruitment  personnel services and management contracts  sale of practice  referral services  warranties  discounts  employees  group purchasing organizations  waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts  managed care arrangements  obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies  investments in group practices  freestanding surgery centers  donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services 
the fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe 
table of contents harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute 
however  such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities 
although we believe that our arrangements with physicians have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations  there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti kickback statute or other applicable laws 
violations of the anti kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to  for each violation or imprisonment  however  under usc section  this fine may be increased to  for individuals and  for organizations 
civil money penalties may include fines of up to  per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and or exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid 
similar state laws many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti kickback statute and the stark law  some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care 
these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure 
in many instances  the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes 
however  in most cases  little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws 
these laws and regulations are extremely complex and  in many cases  we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation 
it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses 
a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws  or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws see legal proceedings  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly 
in addition  we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted  what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be 
if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti kickback statute  the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including criminal penalties  civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities  and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs 
the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
federal false claims act and similar state regulations a current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal false claims act  and  in particular  actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the false claims act s qui tam  or whistleblower  provisions 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
when a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the false claims act  the defendant must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties of between  to  for each separate false claim 
there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the recent enactment of the fraud enforcement and recovery act has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the false claims act  eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention  as well as the receipt  of overpayments 
in addition  a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court 
other fraud and abuse provisions the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to medicare and medicaid 
false claims include  but are not limited to  billing for 
table of contents services not rendered  billing for services without prescribed documentation  misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud 
like the anti kickback statute  these provisions are very broad 
further  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs  whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs 
hipaa also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in medicare 
there are civil penalties for prohibited conduct  including  but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services 
hipaa administrative simplification and privacy requirements the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa  as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech  require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
these provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry 
hipaa also established new federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information 
the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed 
violations of hipaa can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties 
compliance with the electronic data transmission standards became mandatory in october however  during the following year hhs agreed to allow providers and other electronic billers to continue to submit pre hipaa format electronic claims for periods after october   provided they can show good faith efforts to become hipaa compliant 
since this exception expired  we believe that we have been in compliance with the electronic data transmission standards 
we were required to comply with the privacy requirements of hipaa by april  we believe that we were in material compliance with the privacy regulations by that date and remain so  as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance 
the hipaa security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative  physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality  integrity and availability of patient information 
hitech has since strengthened certain hipaa rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information  extended certain hipaa provisions to business associates  and created new security breach notification requirements 
hitech has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a hipaa violation has occurred 
we were required to comply with the security regulations by april  and believe that we have been in substantial compliance with hipaa and hitech requirements to date 
environmental regulations our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
infectious waste generators  including hospitals  face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste  including civil penalties of up to  per day of noncompliance  criminal penalties of up to  per day  imprisonment  and remedial costs 
in addition  our operations  as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
we believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws 
corporate practice of medicine several states  including florida  nevada and texas  have passed legislation that prohibits corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  particular providers for medical products and services 
possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable 
these statutes vary from state to state  are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
we do not expect this legislation to significantly affect our operations 
many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee splitting with physicians 
we do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements 

table of contents emtala all of our hospitals are subject to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
this federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and  if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency  to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition 
our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment 
there are severe penalties under emtala if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay 
penalties for violations of emtala include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare program 
in addition  an injured patient  the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital 
the federal government broadly interprets emtala to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room  but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus  generally  or to a hospital based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital owned ambulance  subject to certain exceptions 
emtala does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services 
the government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce emtala violations actively in the future 
we believe that we operate in substantial compliance with emtala 
health care industry investigations we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business  including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation 
please see item legal proceedings included herein for disclosure related to i litigation and administrative appeal of cms s attempt to terminate medicare participation of two rivers psychiatric hospital  and ii false claim act case against virginia behavioral health facilities 
we and our south texas health system affiliates  which operate mcallen medical center  mcallen heart hospital  edinburg regional medical center and certain other affiliates  were served with a subpoena dated november   issued by the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services oig 
at that time  the civil division of the us attorney s office in houston  texas indicated that the subpoena was part of an investigation under the false claims act regarding compliance with medicare and medicaid rules and regulations pertaining to payments to physicians and the solicitation of patient referrals from physicians from january  to the date of the subpoena  related to the south texas health system 
the civil division of the us attorney s office in houston  texas focused on certain arrangements entered into by the south texas health system affiliates which  the government believes  may have violated medicare and medicaid rules and regulations pertaining to payments to physicians and the solicitation of patient referrals from physicians and other matters relating to payments to various individuals which may have constituted improper payments 
we cooperated with the investigations and  during the fourth quarter of  reached an agreement to resolve the matter 
we agreed to make a payment in the amount of million  which was paid in october of  and  with respect to the south texas health system affiliates  we have entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general for the department of health and human services 
the cia requires south texas health system affiliates to develop and implement an enhanced compliance program and contains specific reporting requirements 
during  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to establish a reserve in connection with this matter and recorded an additional million during also during  we recorded a million unfavorable discrete tax item to reflect the estimated nondeductible portion of the amount reserved 
we do not expect to incur additional material charges with respect to this matter 
we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving  governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices  including ours 
although we believe our policies  procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations  no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to 
table of contents inquiries or actions  or that we will not be faced with sanctions  fines or penalties in connection with the investigations 
even if we were to ultimately prevail  the government s inquiry and or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
our substantial medicare  medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations 
it is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity 
it is also possible that our executives and or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and or named as defendants in private litigation 
revenue rulings and in march and may  the irs issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for profit and not for profit hospitals 
as a result of the tax rulings  the irs has proposed  and may in the future propose  to revoke the tax exempt or public charity status of certain not for profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them 
the tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the irs or the courts regarding the tax exempt or public charity status of a not for profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not for profit hospitals  and or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not for profits 
state rate review some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues  assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state 
in the aggregate  state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially  adversely affected our results of operations 
compliance program our company wide compliance program has been in place since currently  the program s elements include a code of conduct  risk area specific policies and procedures  employee education and training  an internal system for reporting concerns  auditing and monitoring programs  and a means for enforcing the program s policies 
since its initial adoption  the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs 
specific written policies  procedures  training and educational materials and programs  as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business 
specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program 
claims preparation and submission  including coding  billing  and cost reports  comprise the bulk of these areas 
financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources  including compliance with anti kickback and stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training  standardized documentation requirements  and review and audit 
medical staff and employees our facilities had approximately  employees on december   of whom approximately  were employed full time 
our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals 
with a few exceptions  physicians are not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets  may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours 
approximately physicians are employed either directly by certain of our acute care facilities or affiliated by group practices structured as a corporations 
members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time 
we employ approximately psychiatrists within our behavioral health division 
each of our hospitals are managed on a day to day basis by a managing director employed by us 
in addition  a board of governors  including members of the hospital s medical staff  governs the medical  professional and ethical practices at each hospital 

table of contents approximately  of our employees at six of our hospitals are unionized 
at valley hospital medical center  unionized employees belong to the culinary workers and bartenders union  the international union of operating engineers and the service employees international union seiu 
nurses and technicians at desert springs hospital are represented by the seiu

at pennsylvania clinical schools  unionized employees are represented by the district council  american federation of state  county and municipal employees afl cio 
we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
competition the health care industry is highly competitive 
in recent years  competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the united states due to  among other things  regulatory and technological changes  increasing use of managed care payment systems  cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment 
in all of the geographical areas in which we operate  there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals 
in addition  some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property  sale and income taxes 
such exemptions and support are not available to us 
in some markets  certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources  be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us 
certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical  surgical and behavioral health services  facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals 
the increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities  outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us 
the number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage 
typically  physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment 
we believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient s needs  the quality of other physicians on the medical staff  the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital s facilities 
we strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel  technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians 
in addition  we depend on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our medical support personnel  including our nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals 
we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management  nurses and other medical personnel 
our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries  wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate 
in addition  in some markets like california  there are requirements to maintain specified nurse staffing levels 
to the extent we cannot meet those levels  we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
many states in which we operate hospitals have con laws 
the application process for approval of additional covered services  new facilities  changes in operations and capital expenditures is  therefore  highly competitive in these states 
in those states that do not have con laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities  competition in the form of new services  facilities and capital spending is more prevalent 
see regulation and other factors 

table of contents our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals 
managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment 
in addition  employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges 
in return  hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients 
generally  hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price  market reputation  geographic location  quality and range of services  quality of the medical staff and convenience 
the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations 
a key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets 
the competition to acquire hospitals is significant 
we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for profit health care companies  as well as from not for profit entities 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we do 
we intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth  but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms 
relationship with universal health realty income trust at december   we held approximately of the outstanding shares of universal health realty income trust the trust

risk factors we are subject to numerous known and unknown risks  many of which are described below and elsewhere in this annual report 
any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of  or that we currently deem to be immaterial  could also impact our business and results of operations 
a significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in nevada  texas and california 
nevada we own six acute care hospitals and two behavioral health care facilities as listed in item properties 
on a combined basis these facilities contributed in  in  and in of our consolidated net revenues 
on a combined basis  after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense  these facilities generated in  in  and in of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
texas we own eight acute care hospitals and eight behavioral health care facilities as listed in item properties 
on a combined basis these facilities contributed of our consolidated net revenues during each of  and on a combined basis  after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense  these facilities generated in  in  and in of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
california we own four acute care hospitals excluding one replacement facility currently being constructed and nine behavioral health care facilities as listed in item properties 
on a combined basis these facilities contributed of our consolidated net revenues during each of  and on a combined basis  after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense  these facilities generated in  in  and in of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
the significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory  economic  environmental and competition changes in nevada  texas and california 
any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory  economic  environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results 
our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and  in some cases  reduced levels of reimbursement for health care services 
payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments  as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations 
in addition  the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of  among other things  the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions  the funding requirements from the federal government s stimulus package  the war on terrorism and the relief 
table of contents efforts related to hurricanes and other disasters  may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for medicare and medicaid programs 
if the rates paid or the scope of services covered by government payors are reduced  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations 
we receive a large concentration of our medicaid revenues from texas and significant amounts from nevada  florida  california  washington  dc and illinois 
these states  as well as most other states in which we operate  have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in a reduction of medicaid funding for we can provide no assurance that reductions to medicaid revenues  particularly in these states  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to changes in government reimbursement programs  our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors  including managed care providers  significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals 
private payors  including managed care providers  increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment 
we expect continued third party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls 
reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations 
we are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay 
in accordance with our internal policies and procedures  as well as emtala  we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and or seeking medical treatment whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition 
if it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition  we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient s medical condition  within the facility s capability  or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital s written procedures 
if the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly  our results of operations will be harmed 
an increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations 
collection of receivables from third party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient s responsibility  which primarily includes co payments and deductibles 
we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix  the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted 
significant changes in business office operations  payor mix  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable  cash flow and results of operations 
if we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses  our results of operations will be harmed 
a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states could materially affect our business and future results of operations 
our patient volumes  revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets 
a continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued increase in the unemployment rate 
table of contents which will likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance 
as a result  our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes  particularly in less intense  more elective service lines  or a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients 
these factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes  revenues and operating results 
we are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform 
an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been introduced or proposed in recent years that would result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or a state level 
among the proposals that have been introduced are price controls on hospitals  insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses  requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of government health insurance plans that would cover all citizens and increase payments by beneficiaries 
we cannot predict whether any of the above proposals or other proposals will be adopted and  if adopted  no assurances can be given that their implementation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers 
the health care industry is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years 
in all of the geographical areas in which we operate  there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals 
some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property  sales and income taxes 
such exemptions and support are not available to us 
in some markets  certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources  be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we 
the number of inpatient facilities  as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers  many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians  in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly 
as a result  most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
if our competitors are better able to attract patients  recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals  expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities  we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed 
our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians 
typically  physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment 
as a result  the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends  in part  on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians 
physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals and  in a number of our markets  physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals 
they may terminate their affiliation with us at any time 
if we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards  adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians  they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline 
it may become difficult for us to attract an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non urban communities in which our hospitals are located 
our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations 
we depend on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our medical support personnel  including our nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals 
we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management  nurses and other medical personnel 
the nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other health care providers 
this shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel 
in addition  in some markets like california  there are requirements to maintain specified nurse staffing levels 
to the extent we cannot meet those levels  we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff 
if our general labor and related expenses increase we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly 
our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management  nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations 
if we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations  we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability 
the health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state and local government levels relating to  among other things hospital billing practices and prices for services  relationships with physicians and other referral sources  adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services  ownership of facilities  qualifications of medical and support personnel  confidentiality  maintenance and security issues associated with health related information and patient medical records  the screening  stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions  licensure and accreditation of our facilities  operating policies and procedures  and  construction or expansion of facilities and services 
among these laws are the false claims act  hipaa  the federal anti kickback statute and the stark law 
these laws  and particularly the anti kickback statute and the stark law  impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources 
we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities  including employment contracts  leases and professional service agreements 
we also provide financial incentives  including minimum revenue guarantees  to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals 
the oig has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
a number of our current arrangements  including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources  may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti kickback statute 
failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti kickback statute  but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny 
we cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti kickback statute 

table of contents these laws and regulations are extremely complex and  in many cases  we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation 
in the future  it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses 
a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws  or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws see item legal proceedings  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly 
in addition  we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted  what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be 
see item business self referral and anti kickback legislation 
if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti kickback statute  the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including criminal penalties  civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities  and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs 
the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities 
we are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits  product liability lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
some of these actions may involve large claims  as well as significant defense costs 
we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us 
all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations 
we believe that  based on our past experience and actuarial estimates  our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals 
while we continuously monitor our coverage  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates 
if such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future  or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may be subject to governmental investigations  regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits the federal false claims act permits private parties to bring qui tam  or whistleblower  lawsuits against companies 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal  we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware 
in  we agreed to settle a qui tam lawsuit relating to our south texas health system after many years of governmental investigations 
some of our subsidiaries operating small behavioral health care facilities in virginia are currently the subject of governmental investigations  and  in one case  a qui tam action in which the government intervened and is charging violations of the false claims act 
we cannot predict whether we will be the subject of additional investigations or whistleblower lawsuits 
any determination that we have violated applicable laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us 
if any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation  such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under medicare or medicaid 
the construction and operation of health care facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to  among other things  the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  fire prevention  rate setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection 
additionally  such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards 
all of our hospitals are accredited  meaning that they are properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the medicare program 
the effect of maintaining accredited facilities is to allow 
table of contents such facilities to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 
we believe that all of our health care facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal  state  local and other relevant regulations and standards 
however  should any of our health care facilities lose their accredited status and thereby lose certification under the medicare or medicaid programs  such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected 
two rivers psychiatric hospital two rivers  a behavioral health facility operated by one of our subsidiaries  received a notice of termination of its medicare medicaid certification as a result of two rivers alleged failure to correct certain deficiencies which make it ineligible for medicare program participation 
we are attempting to resolve these issues amicably with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in an effort to prevent the termination from going into effect 
in the interim  two rivers has filed an administrative appeal with the us department of health and human services  departmental appeals board  civil remedies division  seeking review of that decision 
in order to prevent cms from terminating the facility from the program prior to a hearing in the administrative appeal  two rivers has filed a complaint in the us district court for the western district of missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against cms proceeding with the termination 
by agreement  the court has issued a temporary restraining order preventing cms from terminating two rivers from the medicare medicaid program until such time that a settlement has been reached with cms or a preliminary injunction has been ruled upon by the court 
in the event that a settlement is not reached or a preliminary injunction is not issued  the termination could go into effect  pending resolution of the administrative appeal 
we can provide no assurance that two rivers will not ultimately lose its medicare certification and any such termination would have a material adverse effect on the facility s future results of operations and financial condition 
the operating results of two rivers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
during the third quarter of  southwest healthcare system swhcs  which operates rancho springs medical center and inland valley regional medical center in riverside county  california  entered into an agreement with the center for medicare and medicaid services cms 
the agreement required swhcs to engage an independent quality monitor to assist swhcs in meeting all cms conditions of participation 
further  the agreement provided that  during the last days of the agreement  cms would conduct a full medicare certification survey 
that survey took place the week of january  at present  we have not been advised of the results from cms 
while we believe that swhcs has complied with all obligations under the agreement  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the survey or that the outcome would not have a material adverse effect on us 
the operating results of swhcs did have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
our growth strategy depends on acquisitions  and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria 
we may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not for profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny 
acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy 
we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for profit health care companies  as well as from not for profit entities 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we do 
also  suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms 
in addition  many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  laws that affect the conversion or sale of not for profit hospitals to for profit entities 
these laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions 
although the level of government involvement varies from state to state  the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and  in some cases  approval of a transaction in which a not for profit entity sells a health care facility to a for profit entity 
the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation  increased review of not for profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals  increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria  any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations 

table of contents further  the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations  depending on various factors  including the amount paid for the acquisition  the acquired hospital s results of operations  allocation of the purchase price  effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases 
we may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire  which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy 
we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations 
we may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals 
integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business  negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel 
in addition  acquisition activity requires transitions from  and the integration of  operations and  usually  information systems that are used by acquired hospitals 
in addition  some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition 
if we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire  operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals  our results of operations could be harmed 
if we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities  we could become liable for material obligations 
hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities  including but not limited to  liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters  we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire 
such liabilities and related legal or other costs and or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could harm our business 
state efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand 
many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures  construction  expansion  modernization or initiation of major new services 
our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition  expansion or replacement  make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs  result in the revocation of a facility s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements 
in the past  we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements  but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations 
controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues 
controls imposed by third party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay  commonly referred to as utilization review  have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities 
utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans 
inpatient utilization  average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue 
although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations  significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 

table of contents fluctuations in our operating results  quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock 
the stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and  as a result  there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock 
if we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future  the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when if becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized 
in addition to our operating results  many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings 
these factors include certain of the risks discussed herein  demographic changes  operating results of other hospital companies  changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  the possible effects of war  terrorist and other hostilities  adverse weather conditions  the level of seasonal illnesses  managed care contract negotiations and terminations  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets  or other developments affecting the health care industry 
we are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price 
as a publicly traded company  we are subject to a significant body of regulation  including the sarbanes oxley act of while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements  we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations 
for example  we cannot provide assurance that  in the future  our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our annual report on form k or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions  fines or other sanctions or litigation 
if we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  our stock price could decline 
different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
generally accepted accounting principles are complex  continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us  our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec 
such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances 
differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor 
such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects 
the cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased 
as we continue to invest in modern technologies  emergency rooms and operating room expansions  the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care  we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds 
in addition  we have a commitment with an unrelated third party to build a newly constructed facility with a specified minimum number of beds and services 
although we 
table of contents evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital  such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained 
the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed 
we require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation  expansion  construction and addition of medical equipment and technology 
we believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand  improve and equip our existing hospitals 
we cannot predict  however  whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed  which could harm our business 
to fund all or a portion of our future financing needs  we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate  long term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program 
if any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments  our liquidity could be impacted  which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the degree to which we are  or in the future may become  leveraged  our ability to obtain financing could be adversely impacted and could make us more vulnerable to competitive pressures 
our ability to meet existing and future debt obligations  depends upon our future performance and our ability to secure additional financing on satisfactory terms  each of which is subject to financial  business and other factors that are beyond our control 
any failure by us to meet our financial obligations would harm our business 
in addition  global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding 
in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time 
our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business 
the expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business 
the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient  quality health care services at our facilities  which could harm our business 
the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock is subject to potential increases or decreases 
at december    shares of class b common stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of class a  c and d common stock outstanding  for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase class b common stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans 
class a  c and d common stock are convertible on a share for share basis into class b common stock 
to the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of class b common stock  the number of shares of class b common stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the holders of class b common stock would own a smaller percentage of that class 
in addition  from time to time our board of directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our class b common stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market 
such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock 
conversely  as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business  we may from time to time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding 
table of contents shares of our class b common stock 
based upon factors such as  but not limited to  the market price of our stock  interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash  repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share 
the right to elect the majority of our board of directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of class a and c common stock  the majority of which is owned by alan b 
miller  our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors 
our restated certificate of incorporation provides that  with respect to the election of directors  holders of class a common stock vote as a class with the holders of class c common stock  and holders of class b common stock vote as a class with holders of class d common stock  with holders of all classes of our common stock entitled to one vote per share 
as of march   the shares of class a and class c common stock constituted of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock and had the right to elect six members of the board of directors 
as of march   the shares of class b and class d common stock excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options constituted of the outstanding shares of our common stock and had the right to elect one member of the board of directors 
as to matters other than the election of directors  our restated certificate of incorporation provides that holders of class a  class b  class c and class d common stock all vote together as a single class  except as otherwise provided by law 
each share of class a common stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote  each share of class b common stock entitles the holder thereof to one tenth of a vote  each share of class c common stock entitles the holder thereof to votes provided the holder of class c common stock holds a number of shares of class a common stock equal to ten times the number of shares of class c common stock that holder holds  and each share of class d common stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes provided the holder of class d common stock holds a number of shares of class b common stock equal to ten times the number of shares of class d common stock that holder holds 
in the event a holder of class c or class d common stock holds a number of shares of class a or class b common stock  respectively  less than ten times the number of shares of class c or class d common stock that holder holds  then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of class c common stock  or one tenth of a vote for every share of class d common stock  which that holder holds in excess of one tenth the number of shares of class a or class b common stock  respectively  held by that holder 
the board of directors  in its discretion  may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of class a or class b common stock as class c or class d common stock  respectively  if such facts are not apparent from our stock records 
as of march   the shares of class a and class c common stock constituted of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock and constituted of our general voting power 
as of march   the shares of class b and class d common stock excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options constituted of the outstanding shares of our common stock and constituted of our general voting power 
since a substantial majority of the class a shares and class c shares are controlled by mr 
alan b 
miller and members of his family who are also directors and officers of the company  and they can elect a majority of the company s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders  there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of the company 
in addition because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger  takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses  the market price of our class b common stock could be adversely affected

litigation and administrative appeal of cms s attempt to terminate medicare participation of two rivers psychiatric hospital two rivers psychiatric hospital two rivers  a behavioral health facility operated by one of our subsidiaries  received a notice of termination of its medicare medicaid certification as a result of two rivers alleged failure to correct certain deficiencies which make it ineligible for medicare program participation 
we are attempting to resolve these issues amicably with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in an effort to prevent the termination from going into effect 
in the interim  two rivers has filed an administrative 
table of contents appeal with the us department of health and human services  departmental appeals board  civil remedies division  seeking review of that decision 
in order to prevent cms from terminating the facility from the program prior to a hearing in the administrative appeal  two rivers has filed a complaint in the us district court for the western district of missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against cms proceeding with the termination 
by agreement  the court has issued a temporary restraining order preventing cms from terminating two rivers from the medicare medicaid program until such time that a settlement has been reached with cms or a preliminary injunction has been ruled upon by the court 
in the event that a settlement is not reached or a preliminary injunction is not issued  the termination could go into effect  pending resolution of the administrative appeal 
we can provide no assurance that two rivers will not ultimately lose its medicare certification and any such termination would have a material adverse effect on the facility s future results of operations and financial condition 
the operating result of two rivers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
false claims act case against virginia behavioral health facilities in late and again on july  and january   the office of inspector general for the department of health and human services oig issued subpoenas to two of our facilities  marion youth center and mountain youth academy  seeking documents related to the treatment of medicaid beneficiaries at the facilities 
it was our understanding at that time that the oig was investigating whether claims for reimbursement submitted by those facilities to the virginia medicaid program were supported by adequate documentation of the services provided which could be considered to be a basis for a false claims act violation 
on august   the office of the attorney general for the commonwealth of virginia issued a subpoena to keystone newport news  another of our facilities 
it was our understanding at that time that the office of attorney general was investigating whether keystone newport news complied with various virginia laws and regulations  including documentation requirements 
in response to these subpoenas  we produced the requested documents on a rolling basis and we cooperated with the investigations in all respects 
we also met with representatives of the oig  the virginia attorney general  the united states attorney for the western district of virginia  and the united states department of justice civil division on several occasions to discuss a possible resolution of this matter 
however  the parties were not able to reach a resolution 
consequently  on november   the united states department of justice and the virginia attorney general intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed under seal in against universal health services  inc  keystone marion  llc and keystone education and youth services  llc  doing business as the marion youth center 
the qui tam case was brought by four former employees of the marion youth center 
at this time  based upon a press release issued by the department of justice  the allegations being pursued by the united states and the commonwealth of virginia appear to relate solely to the marion youth center 
the united states and the commonwealth of virginia now have days in which to serve their complaint upon the defendants 
we have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
although we will continue to work towards a settlement  there is no assurance that a settlement can be reached  and  should a settlement be reached  we are unable at this time to determine the ultimate settlement amount 
if a settlement is not reached  we will defend ourselves vigorously against these allegations 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in the litigation or that the case will be limited to the marion youth center 
ethridge v 
universal health services et 
al in june   we and one of our acute care facilities  lancaster community hospital  were named as defendants in a wage and hour lawsuit in los angeles county superior court

we have denied liability and are defending the case vigorously which has not yet been certified as a class action by the court 
we are still uncertain as to the legal viability and extent of the claims  and  as such  are unable to determine the extent of potential financial exposure at this time 

table of contents the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include  among other things  matters such as government healthcare participation requirements  various licensure and accreditations  reimbursement for patient services  and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse 
government action has increased with respect to investigations and or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and or regulations by healthcare providers 
providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs  subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services 
we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving  governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices  including ours

there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions  fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions  including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed above 
even if we were to ultimately prevail  such inquiries and or actions could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note to the financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided 
medicare and medicaid revenues represented  and of our net patient revenues during  and  respectively 
revenues from managed care entities  including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for  and of our net patient revenues during  and  respectively 
we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third party payors and others for services rendered 
we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates 
payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge  reimbursed costs  discounted charges and per diem payments 
estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information  patient utilization data  government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations 
the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term 
certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital  medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements 
such amounts are included in accounts receivable  net  on our consolidated balance sheets 
the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes 
as such  we can not provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations  if enacted  will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in  or if it were to occur  each adjustment to our estimated net medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december   would change our after tax net income by approximately million 
we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to 
table of contents qualify as charity care  they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable  net 
our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts  based on charges at established rates  amounting to amounts include uninsured discounts mentioned above and data related to an acute care facility that is reflected as discontinued operations million  million and million during  and  respectively 
at our acute care facilities  medicaid pending accounts comprise the large majority of our receivables that are pending approval from third party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states 
approximately or million as of december  and or million as of december  of our accounts receivable  net  were comprised of medicaid pending accounts 
our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration 
at that time  an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned 
there are various pre established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered 
certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently medicaid eligible 
when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending  our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient s medicaid eligibility 
based on historical hindsight information related to medicaid pending accounts  we estimate that approximately or million of the million medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  will subsequently qualify for medicaid reimbursement 
approximately or million of million total medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  subsequently qualified for medicaid pending reimbursement and were therefore appropriately classified at the patient s registration 
additional charity reserves of million during and million during were established to cover the medicaid pending patients that failed to qualify for the medicaid program based on historical conversion rates 
based on general factors as discussed below in provision for doubtful accounts  our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible 
such estimated uncollectible amounts related to medicaid pending  as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications  are considered when the overall individual facility and company wide reserves are developed 
below are the medicaid pending receivable agings as of december  and amounts in thousands under days days days over days total provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from third party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility  primarily co payments and deductibles 
we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix  the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted 
at our acute care hospitals  third 
table of contents party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account 
for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients  the patient is sent a series of statements and collection letters 
patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of assistance including our charity care policy 
if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay  the account is written off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort 
our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of million as of december  and million as of december  the decrease in the charity care reserves resulted primarily from write offs during of fully reserved receivables related to undocumented aliens in our south texas market due to a lack of funding pursuant to the section program 
uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least of total charges 
during the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self pay balances outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
all self pay accounts at the hospital level are fully reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past days from the date of discharge 
potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay 
on a consolidated basis  we monitor our total self pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience 
at december  and december   accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
approximately during and during each of and  of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts  was incurred by our acute care hospitals 
shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable  net of contractual allowances  for our acute care hospitals as of december  and as of december  amounts in thousands days days days over days medicare medicaid commercial insurance and other private pay total as of december  amounts in thousands days days days over days medicare medicaid commercial insurance and other private pay total self insured risks we provide for self insured risks  primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims  based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not reported claims are accrued based 
table of contents on our estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims  which includes costs associated with litigating or settling claims  and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments 
all relevant information  including our own historical experience  the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents  is used in estimating the expected amount of claims 
we also consider amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers  state guaranty funds and other sources in estimating our ultimate net liability for such risk 
our estimated self insured reserves are reviewed and changed  if necessary  at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense 
during the second quarter of  based upon a reserve analysis  we recorded a million reduction to our professional and general liability self insurance reserves relating to years prior to this favorable change in our estimated future claims payments  which was included in our financial results for the year ended december   was partially due to the favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate as well as a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties such as obstetrical due to a continuation of the company wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last few years 
for the years of through  most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with phico  a pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation in february  as a result  although phico continued to be liable for claims on our behalf that were related to through  we began paying the claims upon phico s liquidation 
since that time  although we preserved our right to receive reimbursement from the phico estate  we were not previously able to assess the probability of collection or reasonably quantify our share of the liquidation proceeds 
in january   a court order from the commonwealth court of pennsylvania was executed in connection with the partial liquidation of the phico estate 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  based upon our share of the undisputed and resolved claims made against the phico estate as of a specified date and as approved by the liquidator to the court  we recorded a million reduction to our professional and general liability self insured claims expense 
these liquidation proceeds were received during the first quarter of there were no other adjustments to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability self insured claims 
during the second quarter of  based upon the results of a reserve analysis  we recorded an million reduction to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability self insured claims 
this favorable change in our estimated future claims payments was partially due to the favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate as well as a decrease in obstetrical related claims due to a company wide patient safety initiative in this high risk specialty

in addition  we also maintain self insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims 
the ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported 
long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates 
goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit 
we have designated september st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of september  which indicated no impairment of goodwill 
future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including profitability and market value projections  could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill

sources of revenue overview we receive payments for services rendered from private insurers  including managed care plans  the federal government under the medicare program  state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients 
hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels  the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients  the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services 
charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided eg  medical surgical  intensive care or behavioral health and the geographic location of the hospital 
inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years  primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be 
table of contents provided on an outpatient basis  as well as increased pressure from medicare  medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues 
patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  some private insurance plans  and managed care plans  but are responsible for services not covered by such plans  exclusions  deductibles or co insurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles and co insurance has generally been increasing each year 
indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue 
collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided 
since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from facilities located in nevada and texas  we are particularly sensitive to regulatory  economic  environmental and competition changes in those states 
any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory  economic  environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results 
the following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for i our acute care and behavioral health care facilities combined  ii our acute care facilities  and  iii our behavioral health care facilities 
net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates  which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated

table of contents percentage of net patient revenues behavioral health care facilities third party payors medicare medicaid managed care hmo and ppos other sources total medicare medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged and over  some disabled persons and persons with end stage renal disease 
all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the medicare program  our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program 
under the medicare program  for inpatient services  our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps 
under the ipps  hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge 
the fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s medicare severity diagnosis related group ms drg 
every ms drg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis 
the ms drg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care 
this ms drg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each ms drg 
the ms drg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity 
while we generally will not receive payment from medicare for inpatient services  other than the ms drg payment  a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold 
ms drg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year  which begins on october the index used to adjust the ms drg rates  known as the hospital market basket index  gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services 
generally  however  the percentage increases in the ms drg payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals 
in july   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published the final ipps payment rule which provided for a market basket increase to the base medicare ms drg blended rate 
when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates were considered  our overall increase from the final rule in federal fiscal year was 
in july   cms published the final ipps payment rule which provided for a market basket increase to the base medicare ms drg blended rate 
when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments are considered  we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year rule will approximate 
in september   the tma  abstinence education  and qi programs extension act of legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that cms was set to impose under the final rule for the ipps for federal fiscal year cms planned on reducing the standardized amount by in and in to account for expected changes in coding practices by hospitals in response to the cms 
table of contents implementation of the new ms drg system for inpatient hospitals 
the new law cuts these reductions by in and in in federal fiscal years to  the new law also requires cms to make an adjustment to the medicare standardized amount in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years and as compared to the initial cms estimates of the ms drg coding and documentation change impact of and  respectively 
in federal fiscal year  cms made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and will continue to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of ms drgs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals 
we are unable to predict the impact of this cms adjustment on the revenues and operating results of our acute care hospitals but we do expect the adjustment to result in decreases to future medicare standardized amounts 
psychiatric hospitals had traditionally been excluded from the ipps 
however  on january   cms implemented a new pps psych pps for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the medicare program 
this system replaced the cost based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem psych pps with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics 
the psych pps also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full service emergency department 
according to the may  cms notice  the market basket increase was for the period of july  through june  in addition  according to the may  cms notice  the market basket increase is for the period of july  through june  in october  cms published its annual final medicare outpatient prospective payment system opps rule for the final market basket increase to the opps base rate is

in december  the department of health and human services hhs published a proposed regulation and an interim final rule implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act 
the proposed regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs 
the interim final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria 
the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year and can end as late as for medicare and for the state medicaid programs 
state medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary and we are unable to predict which states will chose to participate 
we estimate that approximately of the projected incentive payments will be paid by medicare and from state medicaid programs 
our acute care hospitals may qualify for these ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria 
these medicare and medicaid incentive payments are intended to offset a portion of the cost incurred to qualify as a meaningful user of ehr 
our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an ehr application  on a facility by facility basis  beginning in late and ending in late however  there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and  should we qualify  we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility 
should we qualify for incentive payments  there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the ehr application which may cause material period to period changes in our future results of operations 
hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by are subject to a reduced market basket update to the ipps standardized amount in and each subsequent fiscal year 
although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the ehr standards by  there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the hitech act 

table of contents medicaid medicaid is a joint federal state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care 
most state medicaid payments are made under a pps like system  or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals 
amounts received under the medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
in addition to revenues received pursuant to the medicare program  we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing medicaid 
all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
we receive a large concentration of our medicaid revenues from texas and significant amounts from nevada  florida  california  washington  dc and illinois 
the majority of these states  as well as most other states in which we operate  have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in the reduction of medicaid funding for and we can provide no assurance that reductions to medicaid revenues  particularly in the above mentioned states  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
furthermore  many states are currently working to effectuate further significant reductions in the level of medicaid funding due to significant state budget deficits also projected for  which could adversely affect future levels of medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals 
conversely  on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of was signed into law and contained various medicaid provisions that will impact our hospitals including the following i temporary increases to medicaid funding through enhanced federal matching assistance percentages fmaps for a month period retroactive to october  through december  with all states receiving a fmap increase of and also receiving a bonus fmap increase contingent on the increased level of a state s unemployment rate  ii a temporary increase of in the federal medicaid disproportionate share hospital allotment for both federal fiscal years and  and  iii states will be required to maintain effort on medicaid eligibility consistent with requirements prior to passage of this law 
due to the indirect nature of the enhanced medicaid federal funding contained within the american recovery and reinvestment act of  we are unable to determine the impact of these medicaid changes on our future results of operations 
certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of texas hildalgo  maverick  potter and webb participate in cms approved private medicaid supplemental payment upl programs 
these hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties 
our hospitals receive both upl payments from the medicaid program and indigent care payments from third party  affiliated hospitals 
the upl payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an inter governmental transfer igt to the state medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals 
we received million during  million during and million during of aggregate  net upl and affiliated hospital indigent care payments 
if during the hospital district makes igts consistent with  we believe we would be entitled to aggregate  net upl and affiliated hospital indigent care payment revenues of approximately million during in july  the texas health and human services commission thhsc issued a final rule and will rebase during state fiscal year sfy  on a statewide budget neutral basis  all acute care hospital inpatient standard dollar amount sda rates 
in addition  the thhsc will also rebase all ms drg relative weights concurrent with this sda rate change 
the thhsc will use sfy cost report cost data for the sda and relative weight rebasing and will only make changes on a prospective basis regardless of when the rebased sda rates and relative weights are implemented 
we expect this rebasing to be implemented by thhsc sometime in or later 
while we are unable to estimate the reimbursement impact  this change could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
in addition  we were notified on may  by the thhsc that the statewide new hospital rate for our hospitals located in south texas will be reduced 
although the definitive hospital rate has not yet been finalized  at this time  we estimate that our texas medicaid reimbursement will be reduced by million annually  
table of contents applied retroactively to september  our financial statements for the twelve month ended december  reflect this estimated hospital rate decrease covering the period of september  through december  this rate change will be superseded by thhsc during sfy by the rebased sda rates required by the july  proposed rule 
managed care a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies  which include health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and managed medicare referred to as medicare part c or medicare advantage and medicaid programs 
in general  we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate 
typically  we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers  however  during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies 
commercial insurance our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance 
private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or  in some cases  reimburse their policy holders  based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy 
private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor 
commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms  including predetermined payment or drg based payment systems  for more inpatient and outpatient services 
to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries  such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals 
other sources our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage 
such patients are evaluated  at the time of service or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines  qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as our local hospital s indigent and charity care policy 
patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care write offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances 
state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments hospitals that have an unusually large number of low income patients ie  those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization  or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment 
congress established a national limit on dsh adjustments 
although this legislation and the resulting state broad based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program  to date the net impact has not been materially adverse 
upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of texas and south carolina s low income patients  five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s dsh fund 
the texas and south carolina programs have been renewed for each state s fiscal years covering the period of october  through september  for each state 
included in our financial results was an aggregate of million during  million during and million during recorded in connection with these dsh programs 
failure to renew these dsh programs beyond their scheduled termination dates  failure of our hospitals that currently receive dsh payments to qualify for future dsh funds under these programs  or reductions in reimbursements  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
assuming that the texas and south carolina programs are renewed for each state s fiscal years at amounts similar to the fiscal year amounts  we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be million during 
table of contents in may  the thhsc completed its mid year update to the medicaid dsh fund which includes a federal stimulus update and a consumer price index update both of which were not included in the state s preliminary dsh payment amounts as well as additional funds being available due to certain other participating texas hospitals reaching their dsh fund limitation 
as a result of this mid year dsh fund update  our medicaid dsh funding increased by million during the state s fiscal year covering the period of september  through august  sources of revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits  the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding  which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals 
in addition  the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of  among other things  the war on terrorism  economic recovery stimulus packages  responses to natural disasters  the expansion of a medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future 
we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations 
healthcare reform proposals are being formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the federal government 
in addition  some of the states in which we operate periodically consider various healthcare reform proposals 
we anticipate that the debate of alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies will continue and may be enacted in the future 
due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of these programs and whether or when they may be enacted  we cannot predict what effect they will have on us or whether they will adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs  our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings  new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations  post payment audits  requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities 
the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years  because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments 
nevertheless  until final adjustments are made  certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required 
finally  we expect continued third party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls 
reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations

discontinued operations during  we sold a bed acute care hospital located in pennsylvania and commenced divestiture considerations for the real property of our four acute care facilities located in louisiana that were severely damaged and closed during as a result of damage sustained from hurricane katrina

we purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of million up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
however  we are liable for of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of million up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
our estimated liability for self insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including  among other things  the number of asserted claims and reported incidents  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies 
while we continuously monitor these factors  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate 
given our significant self insured exposure for professional and general liability claims  there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
as of december   the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was million  of which million is included in other current liabilities 
as of december   the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was million million net of expected recoveries from state guaranty funds of which million is included in other current liabilities

effective april   we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from windstorm damage up to a billion policy limit per occurrence 
losses resulting from non named windstorms are subject to a  deductible 
losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between and based upon the location of the facility of the declared total insurable value of the property 
in addition  we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses 
table of contents resulting from earthquake and flood damage  each subject to aggregated loss limits as opposed to per occurrence losses our earthquake limit is million  except for facilities in alaska  california and the new madrid which includes certain counties located in arkansas  illinois  kentucky  mississippi  missouri and tennessee and pacific northwest seismic zones which are subject to a million limitation 
the earthquake limit in puerto rico is million 
earthquake losses are subject to a  deductible for our facilities located in all states except california  alaska  washington  puerto rico and the new madrid where earthquake losses are subject to deductibles ranging from to based upon the location of the facility of the declared total insurable value of the property 
flood losses have either a  or  deductible  based upon the location of the facility 
due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years  the cost of commercial property insurance has increased 
as a result  catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses as opposed to per occurrence losses 
given these insurance market conditions  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends  or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
effects of inflation and seasonality seasonality our business is typically seasonal  with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this seasonality occurs because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years 
as mentioned above  as a percentage of revenues during as compared to  we experienced decreases in salaries  wages and benefits expense  supplies expense and other operating expenses due to  among other things  a moderation of increases to salaries and wages due to the increased unemployment rates and the impact of the disinflationary economy which has limited our vendors and service providers ability to increase their prices 
however  since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures  as are supply and other costs  we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases 
our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
we believe  however  that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable
