overview we were founded in as a provider of content delivery network  or cdn  services to deliver digital content over the internet 
we began development of our infrastructure in and began generating meaningful revenue in as of december   we had approximately  active customers worldwide 
we primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
we have entered into an increasing number of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on twelve month or longer periods and in some cases  other arrangements 
we believe that having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing any customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services  features and functionalities our existing customers purchase

eyewonder and its subsidiaries employ a staff of on january  we signed a stock purchase agreement in connection with the purchase of a small software company located in germany the german merger sub 
the consideration for the german merger sub consisted of approximately million euros of cash and stock  with up to an additional million euros dependent upon attaining financial performance milestones for the year we primarily derive revenue from the sale of cdn and related services to our customers 
these services include delivery of digital media  including video  music  games  software and social media as well as associated services such as storage  data center  transit and consulting services 
we primarily generate revenue by charging customers on a per gigabyte basis or on a variable basis based on peak delivery rate for a fixed period of time  as our services are used 
during  we entered into a multi element arrangement which generates revenue by providing consulting services related to the development of a custom cdn solution  through the cross license of certain technologies  including certain components of our cdn software and technology  and post contract customer support pcs for both the custom cdn solution and the software component 
we also derive some business from the sale of custom cdn services 
these are generally limited to modifying our network to accommodate non standard content player software or to establish dedicated customer network components that reside both within our network or that operate within our customers network

table of contents traffic on our network has continued to grow 
this traffic growth is primarily the result of growth in the traffic delivered on behalf of existing customers  and to a lesser extent traffic delivered on behalf of new customers 
our revenue is generated primarily by charging for traffic delivered 
during  we continued to add new customers  but also eliminated many customers as we continued to focus on customer quality 
we have seen an increase in the length of our sales cycle  but we continue to see that new and existing customers want the benefits of the specialized services that we bring to the market 
we are also experiencing continued pricing pressure  particularly with our larger customers 
historically  we have derived a small portion of our revenue from outside of the united states 
our international revenue has grown recently  and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on our strategy of expanding our network and customer base internationally 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  revenue derived from customers outside the united states accounted for approximately  and respectively  of our total revenue 
for the year ended december  nearly all of our international revenue was derived from operations in europe 
for the years ended december  and we derived approximately and  respectively of our international revenue from europe and approximately and  respectively of our international revenue from asia pacific 
we expect foreign revenue as a percentage of our total revenues to increase in our international business is managed as a single geographic segment  and we report our financial results on this basis 
during any given fiscal period  a relatively small number of customers typically account for a significant percentage of our revenue 
for example  in  sales to our top customers  in terms of revenue  accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
during and  revenue generated from sales to our top customers  in terms of revenue  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue 
during  and  respectively  one of these top customers  microsoft  represented approximately  and  respectively of our total revenue for that period 
during  we entered into a multi element arrangement with microsoft  under the agreement  we provide consulting services related to the development of a custom cdn solution  technology license and post contract customer support pcs 
revenue from this multi element arrangement is being recognized over the term of the software agreement which at december   had months remaining 
we anticipate customer concentration levels will decrease compared to prior years 
in addition to selling to our direct customers  we maintain relationships with a number of resellers that purchase our services and charge a mark up to their end customers 
revenue generated from sales to reseller customers was approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   and approximately for each of the years ended december  and in addition to these revenue related business trends  our cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars and remained constant as a percentage of revenue in when compared to the increase in absolute dollars is primarily the result of increased network operations personnel costs related to the increased investments to build out the capacity and operate our network off set by lower depreciation expense on our network equipment 
through operating expense has increased in absolute dollars each period as revenue has increased 
in  these increases were primarily due to increased litigation costs and legal fees associated with ongoing intellectual property litigation 
for the year ended december   operating expenses  excluding the provision for litigation  decreased compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreased general and administrative costs primarily litigation costs  bad debt expense and general legal fees and decreased sales and marketing costs primarily due to a reduction in marketing programs off set by increased research and development costs and non network related depreciation 
we make our capital investment decisions based upon careful evaluation of a number of variables  such as the amount of traffic we anticipate on our network  the cost of the physical infrastructure required to deliver that traffic  and the forecasted capacity utilization of our network 
our capital expenditures have varied over time  in particular as we purchased servers and other network equipment associated with our network build out 
for example  in and  we made capital purchases of million and million  respectively 
for the 
table of contents year ended december   we made capital investments of million 
we continue to see improvements in the efficiency of our network allowing us to meet traffic growth with less investment  however we expect to have ongoing capital expenditure requirements  as we continue to invest in and expand our cdn 
for  we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of approximately to of total revenue for the year 
we have also generated revenue from certain customers that are entities related to certain of our founders 
the aggregate amounts of revenue derived from these related party transactions was less than for the year ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we did not generate any revenue from related parties 
we are currently engaged in litigation with one of our principal competitors  akamai technologies  inc  or akamai  and its licensor  the massachusetts institute of technology  or mit  in which these parties have alleged that we are infringing three of their patents 
in february  a jury returned a verdict in this lawsuit  finding that we infringed four claims of the patent at issue united states patent no 
 the patent and rejecting our invalidity defenses 
the court conducted a bench trial in november  regarding our equitable defenses  and we filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s earlier denial of our motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol 
our motion for reconsideration of jmol was based largely upon a clarification in the standard for a finding of joint infringement articulated by the federal circuit in the case of muniauction  inc v 
thomson corp 
the muniauction case  released after the court denied our initial motion for jmol 
on april  the court issued its order and memorandum setting aside the adverse jury verdict and ruling that we did not infringe akamai s patent and that we are entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
based upon the court s april  order we reversed the million provision for litigation previously recorded for this lawsuit as we no longer believe that payment of any amounts represented by the litigation provision is probable 
the court entered final judgment in favor of us on may   and akamai filed a notice of appeal on may  and filed its appeal brief on september  with the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
we filed our reply brief on december  and each party has filed further appeal briefs 
a date has not been set by the appeals court for a hearing 
we cannot assure you that this lawsuit ultimately will be resolved in our favor 
our legal and other expenses associated with this case have been significant 
we include these litigation expenses in general and administrative expenses  as reported in our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
we expect that these expenses will continue to be significant 
in december  level communications  llc  or level  filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia alleging that we were infringing certain patents level acquired from savvis communications corp 
in addition to monetary relief  including treble damages  interest  fees and costs  the complaint sought an order permanently enjoining us from conducting our business in a manner that infringed the relevant patents 
a jury trial was conducted in january  and on january  the jury returned a verdict favorable to us finding that we did not infringe the level patents 
we believe the jury verdict finding that we did not infringe the level patents is correct  and that the claims of infringement asserted against us by level in the litigation were without merit 
the court denied level s subsequent motion for jmol or alternatively for a new trial  and entered a judgment in our favor 
level filed a notice of appeal on july  and filed its appeal brief on october  we filed our reply brief on january  a date has not been set by the appeals court for a hearing 
we intend to vigorously defend the action 
our legal and other expenses associated with this case have been significant 
we include these litigation expenses in general and administrative expenses  as reported in our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
we expect that these expenses will continue to be significant 
in august  we  certain of our officers and current and former directors  and the firms that served as the lead underwriters in our initial public offering were named as defendants in several purported class action lawsuits filed in the united states district courts for the district of arizona and the southern district of new york 
all of the new york cases were transferred to arizona and consolidated into a single action 
the plaintiffs consolidated complaint asserted causes of action under sections   and of the securities act of 
table of contents  as amended  on behalf of a purported class of individuals who purchased our common stock in our initial public offering and or pursuant to our prospectus 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that we omitted and or misstated certain facts concerning the seasonality of our business and the loss of revenue related to certain customers 
on march   we and the individual defendants moved to dismiss all of the plaintiffs claims  a hearing was held on this motion on june  on august   the court granted the motion to dismiss  dismissing plaintiffs claims under section with prejudice and granting leave to amend the claims under sections and plaintiffs chose not to amend the claims under sections and  and on august   the court entered judgment in favor of us 
on september  plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal  and appellate briefs were filed by the parties in january and february  we believe that we and the individual defendants have meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs claims and intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously 
in november the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle this lawsuit for an amount well within the coverage limits of the primary carrier of our directors and officers liability insurance  and we are seeking court approval to finalize the settlement 
at this time we do not believe that a loss is probable 
therefore  there is no provision for this lawsuit in our financial statements 
we were profitable for the year ended december  and unprofitable for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the largest impact to our profitability was the reversal of our provision for litigation judgment accrual of million regarding the patent infringement lawsuit filed by akamai technologies  inc for the year ended december   the largest negative impact to our profitability was litigation costs of million  the accrual of million  for the potential continuing damages  plus additional interest of million  respectively from the jury verdict returned against us regarding the patent infringement lawsuit filed by akamai technologies  inc  and million in share based compensation 
the largest negative impact to profitability was the jury awarded litigation charge of million to akamai for lost profits  reasonable royalties and price erosion damages plus prejudgment interest of million 
in addition  in our profitability was also impacted due to in part an increase in our share based compensation expense  which increased from million in to million 
our future results will be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned risk factors  in this annual report on form k  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  as well as increasing the amount of monthly recurring revenue that we derive from our existing customers  manage the prices we charge for our services  as well as the costs associated with operating our network in light of increased competition  successfully manage our litigation with akamai and level to a favorable conclusion  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  and continued ability to deliver a significant portion of our traffic through settlement free peering relationships which significantly reduce our cost of delivery 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including positive net income 
basis of presentation revenue we primarily derive revenue from the sale of cdn and related services to our customers 
these services include delivery of digital media  including video  music  games  software and social media as well as associated services such as storage  data center  transit and consulting services 
we primarily generate revenue by charging 
table of contents customers on a per gigabyte basis or on a variable basis based on peak delivery rate for a fixed period of time  as our services are used 
our customer agreements relating to these recurring services generally have a term of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
however  some of our contracts with large customers operate on a month to month basis 
our agreements generally commit our customers to a minimum monthly or annual level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
our customer agreements typically renew automatically at the end of the initial term for an additional contract period unless the customer elects not to renew 
based on service usage experience  we and our customers often negotiate revised monthly minimum usage levels or other modified services or terms during a commitment period 
for example  in exchange for increased minimum usage levels and increased contract term  we often agree to a reduced per gigabyte transferred pricing structure 
during we entered into a multi element arrangement with microsoft which generates revenue by providing ongoing cdn traffic services  consulting services related to the development of a custom cdn solution through the cross license of certain technologies  including certain components of our cdn software and technology  and post contract customer support pcs for both the custom cdn solution and the software component 
we also derive some business from the sale of custom cdn services to others 
these are generally limited to modifying our network to accommodate non standard content player software or to establish dedicated customer network components that reside both within our network or that operate within our customers network 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of costs related to the delivery of services  as well as the depreciation costs associated with our network 
costs related to the delivery of our services include fees for transit bandwidth provided by network operators  fees paid for the use of private line capacity for our backbone and metro fiber rings to inter connect our delivery zones  fees paid for co location services  which are the housing  electric and cooling of servers and other equipment in third party data centers  fees paid for non settlement free peering and connection to internet service provider networks  network operations employee costs  including share based compensation expense  and costs associated with third party software licenses 
we enter into contracts with third party network and data center providers  with terms typically ranging from several months to several years 
our contracts related to transit bandwidth provided by network operators generally commit us to pay either a fixed monthly fee or monthly fees plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above a contracted level 
in january and september  we entered into multi year arrangements with a telecommunications provider for additional bandwidth and backbone capacity 
the agreements required us to make advanced payments for future services to be received 
our recently amended master contract with global crossing provides for the use of private lines of varying capacity for our backbone 
the amended agreement provides for substantial added capacity for a year term  and includes a substantial prepayment of fees and charges 
in addition to purchasing services from communications providers  we connect directly to over broadband internet service providers  or isps  generally without either party paying the other 
this industry practice  known as settlement free peering  benefits us by allowing us to place content objects directly on user access networks  which helps us provide higher performance delivery for our customers and eliminate paying transit bandwidth fees to network operators 
this practice also benefits the isp and its customers by allowing them to receive improved content delivery through our local servers and eliminate cost of transit bandwidth associated with delivery receipt of the traffic 
we do not consider these relationships to represent the culmination of an earnings process 
accordingly  we do not recognize as revenue the value to the isps associated with the use of our servers nor do we recognize as expense the value of the bandwidth received at discounted or no cost 

table of contents these peering relationships are mutually beneficial and are not contractual commitments 
in addition to settlement free peering  we incur costs for non settlement free peering as well as costs associated with connecting to the internet service providers 
during  we continued to reduce our network transit bandwidth delivery costs per gigabyte transferred by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions from our existing suppliers associated with higher purchase commitments 
however  due to increased traffic delivered over our network  our total transit bandwidth delivery costs increased during we anticipate our overall transit bandwidth delivery costs will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of expected higher traffic levels  partially offset by continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
we expect that our overall transit bandwidth delivery costs as a percentage of revenue will remain relatively constant in compared to if we do not experience lower per unit transit bandwidth delivery pricing and we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers including our settlement free peering routes  network bandwidth costs could increase in excess of our expectations in future periods 
depreciation expense related to our network equipment increased from through due to additional equipment purchases each year 
during depreciation expense related to our network equipment decreased and in  we anticipate depreciation expense related to our network equipment will again decrease compared to in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
in total  we believe our cost of revenue will increase in in absolute dollars and will decrease as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of lower depreciation expense associated with our network equipment 
thereafter  we expect that the cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars 
each year we expect to deliver more traffic on our network  which would result in higher transit bandwidth delivery cost associated with the increased traffic  however  such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower fixed costs per unit for such things as co location  backbone and metro fiber rings 
additionally  we expect an increase in payroll and payroll related costs  as we continue to make investments in our network to service our expanding customer base 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of the following components payroll  share based compensation and other related costs  including related expenses for executive  finance  legal  business applications  internal network management  human resources and other administrative personnel  fees for professional services and litigation expenses  rent and other facility related expenditures for leased properties  the provision for doubtful accounts  and non income related taxes 
we expect our general and administrative expense to decrease in in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease is due to lower costs associated with ongoing litigation  acquisition related expenses  and bad debt  as well as decreases in accounting and legal and other costs associated with public reporting requirements and compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of in and in the longer term  we expect our general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue as our costs are expected to grow slower than our top line revenue 
we expect that share based compensation expense under will decrease in 
table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of payroll and related costs  including share based compensation expense and commissions and other variable compensation for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and service support functions  professional fees consultants and recruiting fees  travel and travel related expenses as well as advertising and promotional expenses 
we anticipate our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in in absolute dollars and remain constant as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars is due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecast sales  the increase in payroll and related costs of sales and marketing personnel and additional expected increases in marketing costs such as advertising and other lead generating activities 
we expect that share based compensation expense will be consistent with research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of payroll and related costs and share based compensation expense associated with the design  development  testing and certification of the software  hardware and network architecture of our cdn 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we anticipate our research and development expenses will increase in in absolute dollars and increase as a percentage of revenue due to increased payroll and related costs associated with continued hiring of research development personnel and contractors  and investments in our core technology and refinements to our other service offerings 
we expect that share based compensation expense under will be consistent with non network depreciation expense non network depreciation expense consists of depreciation on equipment and furnishing used by general administrative  sales and marketing and research and development personnel 
provision for litigation provision for litigation relates to our accrual for the adverse jury verdict in the akamai litigation 
on february   a jury returned a verdict in favor of akamai in the amount of million plus pre judgment interest estimated to be million that we recorded in during the year ended december   we estimated our revenue from alleged infringing methods totaled approximately of our total revenue 
we recorded a potential additional provision for litigation totaling million  plus additional interest of million  for the year ended december  the total provision for litigation at december  was million 
on april  the court issued its order and memorandum setting aside the adverse jury verdict and ruling that we did not infringe akamai s patent and that we are entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
based upon the court s april  order we have reversed the million provision for litigation previously recorded for this lawsuit as we no longer believe that payment of any amounts represented by the litigation provision is probable 
the court entered final judgment in favor of us 
akamai filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision on may  and filed its appeal brief on september  we filed our reply brief on december  the court has not yet set a hearing date 
we cannot assure you that this lawsuit ultimately will be resolved in our favor 
interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income also includes the realized gains and loss on investments 
we anticipate interest income 
table of contents to decrease in our average cash balance is expected to be lower in  primarily due to our anticipated acquisition of eyewonder  inc  and we expect interest income to be lower due to lower average cash balances 
other income expense our other income expense consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the re measurement of accounts payable and receivables denominated in a foreign currency  the effect of exchange rates on monetary balance sheet and income statement items and the application of our cost plus model on foreign operations in various countries 
other income expense also includes gains or losses from the disposal of assets 
income tax expense benefit our provision for income taxes is comprised of the refund associated with a carryback of net operating loss  the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and tax expense from various foreign jurisdictions 
income tax expense depends on the statutory rate in the countries where we sell our services 
historically  we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the majority of our services to customers based there 
we have begun to further expand our sales of services to customers located outside the united states  in which case we continue to be subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place 
our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly 
in  approximately million of stock based compensation expense was not deductible for tax purposes  as certain executives and other employees made tax elections which established tax bases in these awards at lower than the fair value recognized within the financial statements 
this permanent difference was material to our pre tax net loss in of approximately million 
non tax deductible expenses related to these equity awards was million in  million in  and is expected to be million in  based upon the unvested portion of the equity awards outstanding at december   and the anticipated vesting at that time 
management periodically evaluates if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
during  management determined there was sufficient negative evidence as a result of our cumulative losses to conclude that it was more likely than not that approximately million of net deferred tax assets would not be realized and accordingly established a full valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
we have certain taxable temporary differences related to identifiable indefinite lived assets that cannot be offset by existing deductible temporary differences resulting in a deferred tax liability of  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable reserves  income and other taxes  share based compensation  equipment and contingent obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results  our future financial statements will be affected 

table of contents we define our critical accounting policies as those united states generally accepted accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes 
revenue recognition we primarily derive revenue from the sale of content delivery network services to customers executing contracts having terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly or annual level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly or annual minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our services exceed the monthly minimum  we recognize revenue for such excess in the period of the usage 
for annual or other non monthly period revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognizes any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 
we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated 
the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
we have on occasion entered into multi element arrangements 
when we enter into such arrangements  each element is accounted for separately over its respective service period or at the time of delivery  provided that there is objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements 
objective evidence of fair value includes the price charged for the element when sold separately 
if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided  and other revenue recognition criteria has been satisfied 
if the multi element arrangement includes a significant software component  we recognize software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonable assured 
if a software license contains an undelivered element  the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
the undelivered elements are primarily software support and professional services 
vsoe of fair value of software support and professional services is based upon hourly rates or fixed fees charged when those services are sold separately 
if vsoe cannot be established for all elements to be delivered  we defer all amounts received under the arrangement and do not begin to recognize revenue until the delivery of the last element of the contract has started 
subsequent to commencement of delivery of the last element  we commence revenue recognition 
amounts to be received under the contract are then included in the amortizable base and then recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining term of the arrangement until we have delivered all elements and have no additional performance obligations 
one of our multi element arrangements provide for consulting services related to the development of a custom cdn solution  the cross license of certain technologies  including certain components of our cdn software and technology  and post contract customer support pcs for both the custom cdn solution and the software component the multi element arrangement 
the agreement also contains a commitment by the customer to transmit a certain amount of traffic over our network during a five year period from commencement of the agreement or be subject to penalty payments 
we do not have vsoe of fair value to allocate the fee to the separate elements of the multi element arrangement as we have not licensed the intellectual property and software components  nor pcs separately 
accordingly we will recognize the revenues related to the professional 
table of contents services  license and pcs ratably over the four year period over which the pcs has been contracted as allowed for by asc because delivery of the license and pcs elements of this arrangement had not occurred at june   revenue on all services provided to this customer during the three months ended june   including the ongoing content delivery services  and the direct incremental costs incurred associated with these revenues  were deferred until such time as delivery occurs and pcs had commenced 
concurrently with the signing of the multi element arrangement  we also extended and amended a content delivery contract entered into originally in the arrangement for transmitting content is not a required element of the new software and node development project commencing under the multi element arrangement 
we will continue to receive payments on a usage basis under the content delivery contract 
given that the services are priced at market rates and subject to regular adjustments and are cancelable with thirty days notice  the amount of revenue and pricing is considered variable and contingent until services are delivered 
as such  we have attributed revenue for the services as one that is contingent and becomes measurable as the services are delivered under the terms of the content delivery contract 
accordingly  we will record revenue on a monthly basis in an amount based upon usage 
because the content delivery agreement was amended concurrently with the multi element arrangement  we deferred revenue recognition until commencement of delivery of the last element of the multi element arrangement  which was determined to be july  during the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  in revenue and approximately million  million and million  respectively  in costs of revenue 
as of december   we had remaining deferred revenue related to the multi element arrangement of million  which is expected to be recognized ratably over the remaining month contract period and had related deferred costs of million which are amortized over the same period 
we also sell services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from reseller arrangements is recognized over the term of the contract  based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
we record revenue under these agreements on a net or gross basis depending upon the terms of the arrangement 
we typically record revenue gross when we have risk of loss  latitude in establishing price  credit risk and are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
we have entered into a multi element arrangement that provides for assisting in the build out of a reseller s custom cdn solution  including monthly management of the custom cdn solution and post professional services 
the agreement contains quarterly and annual commitments by the reseller to transmit a certain minimum amounts of traffic over our network for thirteen quarters 
we do not have support for standalone value associated with the build out of the customer cdn solution for this arrangement 
we will recognize the revenue related to the build out  monthly management services  committed traffic and professional services ratably over seventeen quarters  ending on december  the arrangement also allows for us to record revenue under certain circumstances for traffic delivered above the minimum quarterly and annual committed amount 
because delivery of the build out of the custom cdn solution had not occurred at december   revenue on all services provided to this reseller during  including the minimum content delivery services  and the direct incremental costs incurred associated with these revenues  were deferred until such time as delivery occurs and traffic has commenced as of december   we had deferred revenue related to this arrangement of approximately million 
from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell services to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor 
for certain non cash arrangements whereby we provide rack space and bandwidth services to several companies in exchange for advertising we record barter revenue and expense if the services are objectively measurable 
the various types of advertising include radio  website  print and signage 
we recorded barter revenue and expense of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties 
revenue for these transactions is recorded when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service  such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service 
if these conditions are present  we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an assessment as to that customer s ability to pay for the services to be provided 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense or deferred revenue for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
we record reserves as a reduction of our accounts receivable balance 
estimates are used in determining these reserves 
during june  we modified our approach to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we began calculating the allowance for doubtful accounts using the aging of the accounts receivable method 
under this method  the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a calculation that uses our aging of accounts receivable and applies a reserve percentage to the specific age of the receivable to estimate the allowance for bad debt 
prior to june the allowance for doubtful accounts was determined based upon our review of outstanding balances and payment history on a customer specific  account by account basis and certain percentages were applied to specific accounts 
this modification did not materially effect the reserves required 
these estimates could change significantly if our customers financial condition changes or if the economy in general deteriorates 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers primarily related to monitoring payment history and the accounts receivable aging 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in the deferral of revenue until payment is made or we determine payment is reasonably assured 
in addition  we recorded a reserve for service credits 
reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of credits to be issued after the month of billing related to management s estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation awards using the fair value method 
the grant date fair value was determined using the black scholes merton pricing model 
the black scholes merton valuation calculation requires us to make key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
the weighted average expected term for stock options granted was calculated using the simplified method 
the simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period of the stock option 
we have estimated the volatility rates used as inputs to the model based on our volatility rate as a publicly traded company and an analysis of the most similar public companies for which we have data 
we have used judgment in selecting these companies  as well as in evaluating the available historical volatility data for these companies 
we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
annual changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based payments expense  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
the risk free rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 

table of contents we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own share based awards on a prospective basis  and in incorporating these factors into the model 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
effective may   we initiated a stock option restricted stock unit exchange offer the offer 
pursuant to the offer  employees other than executive officers had the opportunity to exchange certain stock options issued by us after april  for restricted stock units rsus 
the exchange ratio was one rsu in exchange for two stock options 
the rsus vest one sixth on december  and one sixth each six months thereafter such that all rsus issued pursuant to the offer will be vested no later than june  the offer was carried out in accordance with tender offer documents filed with the sec on may  the offer expired june  in aggregate   eligible stock options were tendered by eligible employees and  rsus were issued in exchange pursuant to the offer 
in addition  we entered into agreements with executive officers whereby  stock options were exchanged for  rsus 
we determined this was a type i probable to probable modification for substantially all of the tendered options 
accordingly  we measured the incremental fair value of the rsus issued over that of the options tendered and recorded  of additional unrecognized share based compensation related to the offer 
this additional unrecognized share based compensation  as well as unrecognized share based compensation related to the options tendered in the offer  will be recognized over the vesting period of the rsus using the straight line method over the vesting period 
the offer also included the exchange of performance base stock options for one employee 
at the time of the offer  we determined the original award was not probable of being earned  and had not recorded any share based compensation expense 
as such  the exchange of this performance based option for rsus is considered to be a type iii improbable to probable modification 
we measured the fair value of the rsus issued in the offer  and will recognize the expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
on may  we granted  rsus to certain executive officers  the vesting of these rsus began on december  and will continue vesting in increments of th every six months  such that all rsus granted will vest no later than june   subject to the individual continuing to be an employee of the company through each relevant vesting date 
on october   we issued one of our officers  rsus 
the vesting of these rsus began on the one month anniversary of october  and an additional th on the th day of each calendar month thereafter  provided he continues to be a service provider to the company through each date 
on november   we issued one of our officers  rsus 
the vesting of the  rsus  vest fifty percent days after november   and fifty percent on the second anniversary of november  on december   we issued one of our officers  rsus 
one sixteenth th of the rsus vest on march   and th of the rsus vest on each of june  september  december  and march thereafter through and including december  in november  we entered into an equity award amendment with our chief executive officer ceo 
in connection with this award   options to purchase common stock were cancelled and another  options were modified 
in exchange  the ceo received  rsus of which  are service awards vesting over two years and the remaining  are performance awards 
accordingly  we measured the incremental fair value of the rsus issued over the fair value of the options cancelled and modified and recorded  of additional unrecognized share based compensation which will be recognized over the vesting period of the modified options and rsus granted 
the performance based rsus will only vest if we exceed specified revenue and cash gross margin targets during the quarters ending on or before march  the rsus are separated into four tranches of  performance rsu s each 
the maximum number of performance based rsus that may vest is based on the achievement of specific quarterly financial targets 
any performance rsus that have not vested based on the achievement of the quarterly financial targets with respect to quarters on or before march   will expire 
table of contents and be cancelled immediately following the determination of our financial performance for the last quarter ending on or before march  in may  we granted performance based rsus to an executive that will vest according to the achievement of certain sales milestones 
in may  we granted  performance based rsus to various employees 
the performance based rsu s will only vest if a specific revenue target is achieved in any one quarter during the ten full quarters following the date of the grant and provided the employee remains with the company through the vesting date 
as of december   the performance requirement was not probable of being achieved and accordingly no compensation expense has been recognized 
on june  we granted  rsus to certain executive officers 
each of the rsu awards  if eligible  shall vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the third business day following our public announcement of our earnings for the fiscal quarter ending june   and the second and third installments vesting on june  and june   provided the executive officer remains with the company through each such vesting date 
all or a portion of the rsus may become eligible for vesting based upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets for the twelve month period ending june  rsus that do not become eligible are forfeited 
as of december   no compensation expense had been recognized for these rsus 
on june  we granted  stock options to certain executive officers 
each of the stock option awards vest one quarter th on june   and one forty eighth th each month thereafter on the first day of each month  provided the executive officer remains with the company through each such vesting date 
we recognize share based compensation expense using the straight line attribution method 
we also estimate when and if performance based awards will be earned 
if an award is not considered probable of being earned  no amount of stock based compensation is recognized 
if the award is deemed probable of being earned  related compensation expense is recorded over the estimated service period 
to the extent our estimates of awards considered probable of being earned changes  the amount of stock based compensation recognized will also change 
we recorded share based compensation expense related to stock options  restricted stock and rsus under the fair value requirements of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these charges  approximately million in related to options granted to our four founders in connection with our series b preferred stock financing in july unrecognized share based compensation expense totaled million at december   which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
we expect to amortize million during  million in and the remainder thereafter of the unrecognized share based compensation at december  based upon the scheduled vesting of the options outstanding at that time 
we expect our share based payments expense to decrease in and potentially to increase thereafter as we grant additional stock options and restricted stock awards 
contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
with regard to our litigation with akamai  during our financial statement close process for the years ended december  and  we evaluated if additional accrual amounts were required at each reporting period 
we would record additional accrual amounts to the extent we determine amounts are probable of being paid and also reasonably estimable 
on april  the court issued its order and memorandum setting aside the adverse jury verdict and ruling that we did not infringe akamai s patent and that we are entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
based upon the court s april  order we have reversed the million 
table of contents provision for litigation previously recorded for this lawsuit as we no longer believe that payment of any amounts represented by the litigation provision is probable 
the court entered final judgment in our favor 
akamai filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision on may  and filed its appeal brief on september  we filed our reply brief on december   and the court has not yet set a hearing date 
we cannot assure you that this lawsuit ultimately will be resolved in our favor 
deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
asc states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our recent cumulative losses  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes in the period of such realization 
we adopted the provisions of asc formerly fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january   which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the standard provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of the standard and in subsequent periods 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the adoption of the standard did not result in the recognition of an adjustment for the cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting principle 
the unrecognized tax benefit did not increase or decrease from january  to december  we do not anticipate our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within months of the reporting date 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision 
as of december   we had an interest and penalties accrual related to unrecognized tax benefits of  which increased  during we follow the recognition threshold and measurement parameters of the standard for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and related guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
prior to we recorded estimated income tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
our effective tax rate is influenced by the recognition of tax positions pursuant to the more likely than not standard that such positions will be sustained by the taxing authority 
in addition  other factors such as changes in tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions  and significant changes in our operations through acquisitions or divestitures can have a material impact on the effective tax rate 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known 
we conduct business in various foreign countries 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in multiple locations  and the calculation of our foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
we have subjected the profits of certain foreign subsidiaries to united states tax 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 

table of contents the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for united states or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities

as a result of the pay down  we recognized approximately million of expense related to the write off of remaining unamortized deferred financing fees related to our equipment facility 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding balances due on any of our credit facilities 
interest income year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower market interest rates on decreased cash balances 
other income expense year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands other income expense 
table of contents other income expense for the year ended december  consists primarily of foreign exchange losses resulting from the re measurement of accounts payable for invoices denominated in a foreign currency  and the effect of exchange rates on monetary balance sheet and income statement items and the application of the cost plus model on foreign operations in various countries 
other income expense for the year ended december  consists primarily of loss on disposal of assets and a loss on foreign exchange translation 
income tax expense year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands income tax expense we had an income tax provision during the year ended december  of  or 
of our pre tax loss of million which was different than our statutory income tax rate due primarily to the effect of an increase in valuation allowance  for the year ended december  for year ended december   we had an income tax expense of million despite having a pre tax loss of million  due primarily to the effect of non deductible stock compensation expenses not deductible for tax purposes and an increase in valuation allowance 
in  approximately million of stock based compensation expense was not deductible for tax purposes  as certain executives and other employees made tax elections which established tax bases in these awards granted at lower than the fair value recognized within the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions private sales of common and preferred stock and subordinated notes  an initial public offering of our common stock in june  borrowing on credit facilities  and cash generated by operations 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities classified as current totaled million 
cash flow for the years ended december   and operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the net income for the year ended december  and changes in working capital resulting from decreases in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by increases in other assets of million  prepaid expenses of million  income taxes receivable of million  and decreases in accounts payable of million  deferred revenue of million and other current liabilities of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is the result of increased focus on both the quality of our customers and our continued collection efforts 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets is primarily comprised of the current and long term portion of advanced payments made to a telecommunications provider 
the decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily resulted from decreased legal activity and timing of payments for accounts payable 
the decrease in deferred revenue primarily resulted from the amortization of our multi element arrangement 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital resulting from increases in accounts receivable of million and prepaid expenses of million  and a decrease in accounts payable of million  partially offset by increases in other current liabilities of million and deferred revenue of million  and a decrease in income taxes receivable of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital resulting from increases in deferred revenue of million and other current liabilities of million  and a decrease in income tax receivable of million  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million  prepaid expenses of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may not be sufficient to cover new purchases of property and equipment during and litigation expenses associated with patent litigation 
the timing and amount of future working capital changes  requirement to secure potential infringement damages and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities 
investing activities cash used in investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million provided by investing activities for the year ended december  the increased cash used in investing activities represented purchases of short term marketable securities as we invested our cash and cash equivalents into interest bearing securities and higher capital expenditures primarily for network equipment associated with adding additional capacity and geographic expansion of our content delivery network 
cash provided by investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million used in investing activities for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities represented increases in cash received from the sale of short tem marketable securities and lower capital expenditures primarily for network equipment associated with adding additional capacity and geographic expansion of our content delivery network 
cash used in investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in investing was principally comprised of cash invested in short term marketable securities from the proceeds of our ipo and capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment associated with the build out and expansion of our content delivery network 
we expect to have ongoing capital expenditure requirements as we continue to invest in and expand our cdn 
we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of approximately to of total revenue in financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the million reimbursement of litigation expenses received from our escrow account in cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is 
table of contents primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of approximately million from our ipo on june   million decrease in reimbursement of litigation expenses from our escrow account  million excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises in  offset by a net decrease in payments of million on our bank line  and million decrease in capital lease obligations 
cash provided by financing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of common stock in our initial public offering  million in reimbursement of litigation expenses from our escrow account during the year ended december   off set by a repayment in borrowings of million on our bank line 
the company had a million bank line of credit that matured on october  the company did not renew the line of credit 
at december  we had no outstanding balance on any of our credit facilities and we had an unused line of credit of up to million dollars 
under the terms of the line of credit  we could borrow up to of the cash balances we hold at the bank  up to a maximum of million dollars 
we did not utilize the line of credit during and as previously mentioned the line of credit matured on october  in connection with our series b preferred stock financing in july  an escrow account was established with an initial balance of approximately million to serve as security for the indemnification obligations of our stockholders tendering shares in that financing and to fund of the ongoing monthly expenses associated with the akamai litigation 
in may  we  the tendering stockholders and the series b preferred stock investors agreed to distribute million of the escrow account to the tendering stockholders upon the closing of our initial public offering 
during the years ended december  and  we received approximately and million  respectively  in reimbursements from this escrow 
at december  and  the balance outstanding in the escrow was zero 
changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in  among other things  working capital items such as deferred revenues  accounts payable  accounts receivable  accrued provision for litigation and various accrued expenses  as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to debt repurchases and issuances  stock option exercises  sales of equity investments and similar events 
on december  the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire eyewonder  inc a leading rich media ad serving vendor 
under the terms of the merger agreement  the purchase price which includes both cash and company stock will use approximately million  subject to certain adjustments described in the merger agreement  of our current cash balance as of december  on january  we signed a stock purchase agreement in connection with the purchase of a small software company located in germany the german merger sub 
the consideration for the german merger sub consisted of approximately million euros of cash and stock  with additional consideration of up to million euros dependent upon attaining financial performance milestones for the year we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change  or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
in the event that 
table of contents additional financing is required from outside sources  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commercial commitments in the normal course of business  we make certain long term commitments for operating leases  primarily office facilities  bandwidth and computer rack space 
these leases expire on various dates ranging from to we expect that the growth of our business will require us to continue to add to and increase our long term commitments in and beyond 
as a result of our growth strategies  we believe that our liquidity and capital resources requirements will grow 
the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  as of december  over the next five years and thereafter in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years more than years operating leases bandwidth leases rack space leases real estate leases total operating leases capital leases bank debt interest on bank debt total commitments off balance sheet arrangements we do not have  and have never had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
use of non gaap financial measures to evaluate our business  we consider and use non gaap revenue  non gaap net income loss and adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our operating performance 
these measures include the same adjustments that management takes into account when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period to period basis 
we consider non gaap revenue and net income loss to be an important indicator of overall business performance because it allows us to illustrate the impact of the effect from our multi element contract as well as to eliminate the effects of share based compensation  litigation expenses  provision for litigation and acquisition related expenses 
we define ebitda as gaap net income loss before interest income  interest expense  other income and expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe that ebitda provides a useful metric to investors to compare us with other companies within our industry and across industries 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda plus deferred revenue less related deferred costs from our multi element contract and adjustments for operational expenses that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance 
we also believe use of adjusted ebitda facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period 
in addition  it should be noted that our performance based executive officer bonus structure is tied closely to our performance as measured in part by certain non gaap financial measures 

table of contents in our february  earnings press release as furnished on form k  we included non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
the terms non gaap revenue and net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not defined under united states generally accepted accounting principles  or united states gaap  and are not measures of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with united states gaap 
our non gaap revenue and net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and when assessing our operating performance  non gaap revenue  net income  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income loss or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with united states gaap 
some of these limitations include  but are not limited to ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary for litigation costs  they do not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on any debt that we may incur  they do not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  while share based compensation is a component of operating expense  the impact on our financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and assumed volatility of our common stock  and other companies may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap revenue  non gaap net income loss and adjusted ebitda only as supplemental support for management s analysis of business performance 
non gaap revenue  non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated as follows for the periods 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in accordance with the requirements of regulation g issued by the securities and exchange commission  we are presenting the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and reconciling the non gaap financial metrics to the comparable gaap measures

specifically  the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on the relative selling prices 
in absence of the vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling price  consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management s best estimate of the selling prices 
in addition  the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation 
in october  the fasb also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements 
specifically  tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above 
both standards will be effective for us in the first quarter of early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt these new accounting standards in the first quarter of using the prospective method and we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
had we adopted these new accounting standards in  the impact on our consolidated financial statements would have been immaterial 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that clarifies the scope of the decrease in ownership provisions and expands the disclosure requirements about deconsolidation of a subsidiary or de recognition of a group of assets 
the standard is effective beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december  the amendments in the standard must be applied retrospectively to the first period that an entity adopted sfas the adoption of the standard did not have any material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that requires new disclosures and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
the standard requires a reporting entity to disclose significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  to describe the reasons for the transfers and to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs 
the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating this new standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio 
in our investment portfolio  we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our investments are primarily with our commercial and investment banks and  by policy  we limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds  united states treasury obligations  high quality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity 
foreign currency risk substantially all of our customer agreements are denominated in united states dollars  and therefore our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk 
because we have operations in europe and asia  however  we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates with respect to certain operating expenses and cash flows 
additionally  we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations  potentially with customer agreements denominated in foreign currencies  which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
at this time  we do not have any foreign hedge contracts 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
