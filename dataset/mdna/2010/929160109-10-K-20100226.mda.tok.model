new home construction declined to historically low levels  while tight credit and business failures contributed to a sharp decrease in construction of nonresidential buildings  particularly stores and offices 
construction activity funded by the public sector  typically less affected in economic cycles  was weak as page 
table of contents well in declining state revenues reduced the amount of funds available at the state level for public construction projects 
the effects of the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra were helpful  but the bulk of funds for transportation infrastructure under this act will be spent in and the positive effects of arra spending in were somewhat offset by the failure of congress to extend or reauthorize the most recent multi year federal transportation bill  which expired on september  as a result  funds for highway construction are being provided by a series of relatively short continuing resolutions and at funding levels considerably below what would have been available had congress extended the provisions of safetea lu 
this uncertainty compelled many states to postpone highway maintenance and improvement projects 
arra includes economic stimulus funding of to billion for heavy construction projects that use our products  including billion for highways and bridges 
vulcan served states were apportioned more funds than other states  with california  texas and florida receiving nearly of the total for highways and bridges 
beginning in mid year  highway construction awards were buoyed by stimulus related funding 
through december  the federal highway administration reported that approximately of the billion of funding for highway and bridge projects had been obligated  billion was under construction and billion had been paid to contractors for work performed 
during this period  most vulcan served states lagged the rest of the country in awarding and starting stimulus related highway construction projects 
these differences in awarding projects and spending patterns were due in part to the types of projects planned and to the proportion sub allocated to metropolitan planning organizations where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time consuming 
however  in the fourth quarter  contract awards for highways in vulcan served states increased from compared to a increase in other states 
this provides some evidence that construction activity in vulcan served states will improve in despite these challenging conditions  we have worked diligently to manage effectively those aspects of the business that we are able to control 
we were able to achieve modest price increases  which helped offset lower sales volumes 
we reduced selling  administrative and general expenses by million compared to we adjusted production levels to meet demand and  as a result  employment levels across the company were lower than in these effective cost management efforts have allowed us to maximize cash flow in a period of unprecedented and prolonged economic downturn 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures free cash flow and ebitda are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  thus  they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity or earnings measure defined by gaap 
these metrics are presented for the convenience of investment professionals that use such metrics in their analysis and to provide our shareholders with an understanding of the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions 
these metrics are often used by the investment community as indicators of a company s ability to incur and service debt 
we internally use free cash flow  ebitda and other such measures to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company 
we do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources internally 
reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest gaap measures are presented below free cash flow free cash flow deducts purchases of property  plant equipment from net cash provided by operating activities

continued weakness in private construction activity  both residential and nonresidential  and the uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of either a formal extension or reauthorization of the multi year federal highway program offset the benefits of stimulus related construction activity in furthermore  construction activity on stimulus related highway projects varied widely in vulcan served states  and in certain key states lagged the rest of the country 
we continue to run the business in a cost efficient manner  with a focus on effectively managing those aspects of cost we can control or influence in order to maximize our cash generation during the economic downturn 
our efforts contributed to reductions in cash fixed costs in our operations as well as reductions in overhead expenses 
the average selling price for aggregates increased in despite lower shipments  reflecting attractive pricing fundamentals of our business 
the higher selling price for aggregates reflects increased market prices as well as proportionately greater levels of higher priced aggregates used for highway construction 
as a result of these actions  the cash earnings generated on each ton of aggregates sold in nearly matched the record level achieved in the increased level of unit profitability supports our optimism about the earnings potential of our business when demand begins to recover 
the results include an estimated million  or per diluted share  after tax goodwill impairment charge for our cement segment which is located in florida 
the results also include net earnings per diluted share of from the sale of mining operations divested as a condition for approval by the department of justice of the florida rock acquisition

our year over year pricing improved in  in and in we are tightly managing plant operating costs and overhead expenses as we continue to adjust our cost structure to match weak demand 
we have limited operating hours  streamlined our work force  and focused on achieving production efficiencies at reduced operating rates in the face of a sharp decline in demand for our products 
as a result  our cash earnings per ton of aggregates  while essentially flat compared to and  is higher than the level  which was a year of peak demand for aggregates 
we will continue to manage controllable costs aggressively and to focus on cash margins and earnings 
asphalt mix and concrete revenues and gross profits in millions bar chart shipments of asphalt mix declined in compared to and declined by in compared to asphalt materials margins were higher than the prior year as slightly lower selling prices for asphalt mix were more than offset by a decline in the costs for liquid asphalt 
ready mixed concrete shipments declined by in from to  the sharp increase in ready mixed concrete shipments resulted from the inclusion of a full year of sales from the acquired florida rock concrete operations 
ready mixed concrete pricing remained relatively flat during the three year period

we acquired the cement segment in november as part of the florida rock acquisition  so we reported no comparable revenues or earnings for the first ten months of selling  administrative and general expenses in millions bar chart selling  administrative and general expenses sag include million in and million in of expenses for property donations recorded at fair value 
the gains from these donations  which are equal to the excess of the fair value over the carrying value  are included in gain on sale of property  plant equipment in the consolidated statements of earnings 
excluding the effect of these property donations  sag in declined million  or 
the year over year decline is due mostly to reductions in employee related expenses which more than offset a year over year increase in project costs related to the replacement of legacy it systems 
employment levels across vulcan are down from the prior year 
the sag increase in over was primarily attributable to including a full year of expenses for the former florida rock businesses 
employment levels in were down from goodwill impairment there were no charges for goodwill impairment in and during  we recorded a million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our cement segment in florida  representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit
