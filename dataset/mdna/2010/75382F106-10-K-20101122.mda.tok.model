item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations plan of operation overview you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of august   and the notes to such consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this ann ual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise eg  our consolidated financial statements as of august   and the notes to such consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  or a reference to an event or circumstance that occurred prior to the effective time of the merger on september   all references in this annual report on form k to we  us  our  the company  raptor and similar references refer to the public company formerly known as torreypines therapeutics  inc and now known as raptor pharmaceutical corp  including its wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries which includes raptor pharmaceuticals corp  raptor discoveries inc  raptor therapeutics inc and rapt or pharmaceuticals europe bv  following the name change and completion of the merger 
on august   our former wholly owned subsidiary  tptx  inc was merged into raptor therapeutics inc plan of operation and overview we believe that we are building a balanced pipeline of drug candidates that may expand the reach and benefit of existing therapeutics 
our product portfolio includes both candidates from our proprietary drug targeting platforms and in licensed and acquired product candidates 
our current pipeline includes three clinical development programs which we are actively developing 
we also have three other clinical stage product candidates  for which we are seeking business development partners but are not actively developing  and we have four preclinical product candidates we are developing  three of which are based upon our proprietary drug targeting platforms 
clinical development programs our three active clinical development programs are based on an existing therapeutic that we are reformulating for potential improvement in safety and or efficacy and for application in new disease indications 
these clinical development programs include the following dr cysteamine for the potential treatment of nephropathic cystinosis  or cystinosis  a rare genetic disorder  dr cysteamine for the potential treatment of non alcoholic steatohepatitis  or nash  a metabolic disorder of the liver  and dr cysteamine for the potential treatment of huntington s disease  or hd  an inherited neurodegenerative disorder 
other clinical stage product candidates we have three clinical stage product candidates for which we are seeking partners convivia for the potential management of acetaldehyde toxicity due to alcohol consumption by individuals with aldehyde dehydrogenase  or aldh deficiency  an inherited metabolic disorder  and tezampanel and ngx  non opioids for the potential treatment of migraine  acute pain  and chronic pain 
preclinical product candidates our preclinical platforms consist of targeted therapeutics  which we are developing for the potential treatment of multiple indications  including liver diseases  neurodegenerative diseases and breast cancer 
these preclinical platforms include the following our receptor associated protein  or rap  platform consists of heptide for the potential treatment of primary liver cancer and other liver diseases  and neurotrans to potentially deliver therapeutics across the blood brain barrier for treatment of a variety of neurological diseases 
our mesoderm development protein  or mesd  platform consists of wnttide for the potential treatment of breast cancer 
we are also examining our glutamate receptor antagonists  tezampanel and ngx  for the potential treatment of thrombosis disorder 
future activities over the next months  we plan to conduct research and development activities based upon our dr cysteamine clinical programs and continued development of our preclinical product candidates 
we also plan to seek new business development partners for our convivia product candidate and tezampanel and ngx we may also develop future in licensed technologies and acquired technologies 
a brief summary of our primary objectives in the next months for our research and development activities is provided below 
there can be no assurances that our research and development activities will be successful 
in addition  if we do not raise additional funds  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
clinical development programs we develop clinical stage drug product candidates which are internally discovered therapeutic candidates based on our novel drug delivery platforms and in licensed or purchased clinical stage products which may be new chemical entities in mid to late stage clinical development  currently approved drugs with potential efficacy in additional indications  and treatments that we could repurpose or reformulate as potentially more effective or convenient treatments for a drug s currently approved indications 
lead clinical development program development of dr cysteamine for the potential treatment of nephropathic cystinosis or cystinosis our dr cysteamine product candidate is a proprietary delayed release  enteric coated microbead formulation of cysteamine bitartrate contained in a gelatin capsule 
we are investigating dr cysteamine for the potential treatment of cystinosis 
immediate release cysteamine bitartrate  a cystine depleting agent  is currently the only fda and the ema  approved drug to treat cystinosis  a rare genetic disease 
immediate release cysteamine has been reported to be effective at preventing or delaying kidney failure and other serious health problems in cystinosis patients 
however  we believe that patient compliance is challenging due to the requirement for every six hour dosing and gastrointestinal side effects 
our dr cysteamine for the potential treatment of cystinosis is designed to mitigate some of these difficulties 
it is expected to be dosed twice daily  compared to the current every six hour dosing schedule 
in addition  dr cysteamine is designed to pass through the stomach and deliver the drug directly to the small intestine  where it is more easily absorbed into the bloo dstream and may result in fewer gastrointestinal side effects 
the ema and fda granted orphan drug designation for dr cysteamine for the treatment of cystinosis in and  respectively 
in june  we commenced our phase b clinical trial of dr cysteamine in cystinosis  in which we enrolled nine cystinosis patients with histories of compliance using the currently available immediate release form of cysteamine bitartrate 
the clinical trial  which was conducted at the university of california at san diego  or ucsd  evaluated safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of dr cysteamine in patients 
in november  we released the data from the study which indicated improved tolerability and the potential to reduce total daily dosage and administration frequency compared to immediate release cysteamine bitartrate 
on june   we commenced our phase clinical trial  designed as a multi center  randomized  crossover  outpatient study of the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  or pk  and pharmacodynamics  or pd  of every hour dr cysteamine compared to immediate release cysteamine bitartrate in cystinosis patients 
the design of our phase clinical trial is a result of discussions with the fda under a special protocol assessment  or spa  process by which the fda provided significant guidance on trial protocol design  clinical endpoints  and statistical analyses 
the primary endpoint of our study is the steady state white blood cell  or wbc  cystine levels of patients taking dr cysteamine compared to immediate release cysteamine bitartrate 
secondary endpoints are the safety and tolerability of dr cysteamine and the comparability of steady state pk of dr cysteamine and immediate release cysteamine bitartrate in cystinosis patients 
our phase clinical trial is being conducted at nine sites in north america and europe 
we expect to enroll at least patients 
patients who complete the nine week clinical trial will be offered enrollment into our long term follow on study 
we anticipate that our phase clinical trial enrollment will be completed in december if dr cysteamine is approved by the fda  we plan to commercialize dr cysteamine in the us by ourselves 
however  we may enter into marketing partnerships for certain markets outside of the us development of dr cysteamine for the potential treatment of non alcoholic steatohepatitis or nash in october  we commenced a clinical trial in collaboration with ucsd to investigate a prototype formulation of dr cysteamine for the treatment of nash in juvenile patients 
in may  we presented positive phase a clinical trial results from our pilot study of delayed release cysteamine bitartrate in adolescent patients with nash  a progressive form of liver disease believed to affect to of the us population 
the results were presented at the digestive disease week conference in new orleans  louisiana on may  our open label phase a clinical trial was conducted under a collaboration agreement with ucsd at ucsd s general clinical research center 
eligible patients with baseline levels of the liver enzymes alanine tran saminase  or alt  and aspartate aminotransferase  or ast  that were at least twice that of normal levels  were enrolled to receive twice daily  escalating oral doses of up to  mg of delayed release cysteamine bitartrate a prototype of our dr cysteamine for six months  followed by a six month post treatment monitoring period 
patients showed a marked decline in alt levels during the treatment period with of patients achieving a greater than reduction and of reduced to within normal range 
ast levels also saw significant improvements with patients averaging reduction by the end of the treatment phase 
the reduction in liver enzymes was largely sustained during the month post treatment monitoring phase 
other important liver function markers showed positive trends 
levels of cytokeratin  a potential marker of disease activity in non alcoholic fatty liver disease  or nafld  decreased by an average of 
adiponectin levels increased by an average of during the treatment period 
reduced adiponectin levels are thought to be a marker of the pathogenesis and progression of nash 
bo dy mass index  or bmi  did not change significantly during both the treatment and post treatment phases 
delayed release cysteamine bitartrate demonstrated a strong  favorable safety profile  with mean gastrointestinal symptom scores of at baseline and after months of treatment using a rating system in which the maximum score of indicates most severe gastrointestinal symptoms 
there are no currently approved drug therapies for nash  and patients are limited to lifestyle changes such as diet  exercise and weight reduction to manage the disease 
dr cysteamine may provide a potential treatment option for patients with nash 
although nash is most common in insulin resistant obese adults with diabetes and abnormal serum lipid profiles  its prevalence is increasing among juveniles as obesity rates rise within this patient population 
although most patients are asymptomatic and feel healthy  nash causes decreased liver function and can lead to cirrhosis  liver failure and end stage liver disease 
we are currently working with our clinical trial material manufacturer to provide an appropriate formulation of dr cysteamine for our next potential clinical trial in nash and are preparing an ind submission in in anticipation of such clinical trial 
although it is our intention to continue the clinical development of dr cysteamine in nash  we are currently not funded for  and therefore do not have a timetable for  the initiation of a phase b clinical trial 
we are in early stages of discussions to co develop or partner the clinical development of dr cysteamine in nash 
development of dr cysteamine for the potential treatment of huntington s disease or hd huntington s disease  or hd  is a fatal  inherited degenerative neurological disease affecting about  people in the us and a comparable number of people in europe 
we are not aware of any treatment for hd other than therapeutics that minimize symptoms such as the uncontrollable movements and mood swings resulting from hd 
we are collaborating with a french institution  chu d angers  on a phase clinical trial investigating dr cysteamine in hd patients  which began in october we are providing the clinical trial materials for the study  which is sponsored by chu d angers and funded in part by a grant from the french government 
eight clinical sites in france are being set up by chu d angers for a patient  placebo controlled  month trial  followed by an open label trial with all placebo pat ients rolling onto dr cysteamine and all non placebo patients continuing on dr cysteamine for up to another months 
the primary end point of the trial will be based upon the unified huntington s disease rating scale  or uhdrs 
we were granted orphan drug designation in the us by the fda for cysteamine as a potential treatment for hd in and are in the process of applying for orphan drug designation in the eu in june  we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to intellectual property related to the potential treatment of huntington s disease from the weizmann institute of science in israel and niigata university in japan 
the weizmann and niigata patents cover the use of transglutaminase inhibitors  a class of molecules chemically similar to cysteamine  in the potential treatment of huntington s disease and other neurological disorders 
these patents add to our portfolio of intellectual property related to our programs utilizing dr cysteamine 
other clinical stage product candidates we have three clinical stage product candidates for which we are seeking partners 
convivia for liver aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency convivia is our proprietary oral formulation of methylpyrazole  or mp  intended for the potential treatment of acetaldehyde toxicity resulting from alcohol consumption in individuals with aldh deficiency  which is an inherited disorder of the body s ability to breakdown ethanol  commonly referred to as alcohol intolerance 
mp is presently marketed in the us and us in an intravenous form as an anti toxin 
convivia is designed to lower systemic levels of acetaldehyde a carcinogen and reduce symptoms  such as tachycardia and flushing  associated with alcohol consumption by aldh deficient individuals 
convivia is a capsule designed to be taken approximately minutes prior to consuming an alcoholic beverage 
in  we completed a phase a dose escalation clinical trial of oral mp with ethanol in aldh deficient patients 
the study results demonstrated that the active ingredient in convivia significantly reduced heart palpitations tachycardia  which are commonly experienced by aldh deficient people who drink  at all dose levels tested 
the study also found that the mp significantly reduced peak acetaldehyde levels and total acetaldehyde exposure in a subset of the study participants who possess specific genetic variants of the liver adh and aldh enzymes 
we believe that this subset represents approximately one third of east asian populations 
in june  we entered into an exclusive agreement with uni pharma co  ltd  or uni pharma to commercialize convivia in taiwan 
under terms of the agreement  we will grant to uni pharma an exclusive license under all relevant patent applications  trademarks and future patents controlled by us to market convivia in taiwan  with an option to expand the license to south korea under the same terms 
uni pharma will register convivia for drug licensure for existing indications and will conduct a clinical trial and register conviviatm for acetaldehyde toxicity resulting from aldh deficiency 
uni pharma will be responsible for marketing and sales activities for the commercialization of convivia in the markets covered under the licens e agreement 
we continue to seek potential partners in other asian countries to continue clinical development of conviviatm in those countries 
tezampanel and ngx for the potential treatment of migraine and pain tezampanel and ngx  the oral prodrug of tezampanel  are what we believe to be first in class compounds that may represent novel treatments for both pain and non pain indications 
tezampanel and ngx are receptor antagonists that target and inhibit a specific group of receptors the ampa and kainate glutamate receptors found in the brain and other tissues 
while normal glutamate production is essential  excess glutamate production  either through injury or disease  has been implicated in a number of diseases and disorders 
published data show that during a migraine  increased levels of glutamate activate ampa and kainate receptors  result in the transmission of pain and  in many patients  the development of increased pain sensitivity 
by acting at both the ampa and kainate receptor sites to competitively block the bindi ng of glutamate  tezampanel and ngx have the potential to treat a number of diseases and disorders 
these include chronic pain  such as migraine and neuropathic pain  muscle spasticity and a condition known as central sensitization  a persistent and acute sensitivity to pain 
results of a phase b clinical trial of tezampanel were released in october in the trial  a single dose of tezampanel given by injection was statistically significant compared to placebo in treating acute migraine headache 
this was the sixth phase trial in which tezampanel has been shown to have analgesic activity 
based on a review of the phase data  the fda has agreed that tezampanel may move forward into a phase program for acute migraine 
in december  results of ngx in a human experimental model of cutaneous pain  hyperalgesia and allodynia demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in spontaneous pain  hyperalgesia and allodynia compared to placebo following injections of capsaicin ie  chili oil under the skin 
in february  results from a phase multiple dose trial of ngx showed that the compound is safe and well tolerated in healthy male and female subjects when dosed once daily for five consecutive days 
in november  we announced the presentation of clinical trial data on ngx at the th international conference on the mechanisms and treatment of neuropathic pain 
the results of the study led by mark wallace  md  professor of clinical anesthesiology at the center for pain medicine of the university of california at san diego  suggested that ngx has the potential to be effective in a variety of neuropathic pain states  which are caused by damage to or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system rather than stimulation of pain receptors 
we are currently seeking out licensing partners for the migraine and pain programs and no development costs will be incurred for further development of these indications 
preclinical product candidates we are also developing a drug targeting platform based on the proprietary use of rap and mesd 
we believe that these proteins may have therapeutic applications in cancer  infectious diseases and neurodegenerative diseases  among others 
these applications are based on the assumption that our targeting molecules can be engineered to bind to a selective subset of receptors with restricted tissue distribution under particular conditions of administration 
we believe these selective tissue distributions can be used to deliver drugs to the liver or to other tissues  such as the brain 
in addition to selectively transporting drugs to specific tissues  selective receptor binding constitutes a means by which receptor function might be specifically controlled  either through modulating its binding capacity or its prevalence on the cell surface 
mesd is being engineered for this latter application 
heptide for hepatocellular carcinoma or hcc and other liver diseases drugs currently used to treat primary liver cancer are often toxic to other organs and tissues 
we believe that the pharmacokinetic behavior of rap ie  the determination of the fate or disposition of rap once administered to a living organism may diminish the non target toxicity and increase the on target efficacy of attached therapeutics 
in preclinical studies of our radio labeled heptide a variant of rap  heptide  our proprietary drug targeting peptide was shown to distribute predominately to the liver 
radio labeled heptide  which was tested in a preclinical research model of hcc at the national research council in winnipeg  manitoba  canada  showed times more delivery to the liver than the radio labeled control 
another study of radio labeled heptide in a non hcc preclinical model  showed times more delivery to the liver than the radio labeled control  with significantly smaller amounts of radio labeled heptide delivery to other tissues and organs 
hcc is caused by the malignant transformation of hepatocytes  epithelial cells lining the vascular sinusoids of the liver  or their progenitors 
heptide has shown to bind to lipoprotein receptor related protein  or lrp  receptors on hepatocytes 
we believe that the pharmacokinetics and systemic toxicity of a number of potent anti tumor agents may be controlled in this way 
there are additional factors that favor the suitability of rap as an hcc targeting agent rap is captured by hepatocytes with efficiency  primarily on first pass 
late stage hcc is perfused exclusively by the hepatic artery  while the majority of the liver is primarily perfused through the portal vein 
studies have shown that the rap receptor  lrp  is well expressed on human hcc and under expressed on non cancerous  but otherwise diseased  hepatocytes 
also  lrp expression is maintained on metastasized hcc 
these factors will favor delivery of rap peptide conjugated anti tumor agents to tumor cells  whether in the liver or at metastasized sites 
we are evaluating conjugates between heptide and other molecules for testing in vitro and in appropriate preclinical models for the potential treatment of hcc and other liver diseases 
neurotrans for the potential treatment of diseases affecting the brain hundreds of known genetic and neurodegenerative diseases affect the brain 
drugs often have difficulty reaching these disease affected areas because the brain has evolved a protective barrier  commonly referred to as the blood brain barrier 
part of the solution to the medical problem of neurodegenerative diseases is the creation of effective brain targeting and delivery technologies 
one of the most obvious ways of delivering therapeutics to the brain is via the brain s extensive vascular network 
treating these diseases by delivering therapeutics into the brain in a minimally invasive way  including through a natural receptor mediated transport mechanism called transcytosis  is a vision shared by many researchers and clinicians in the neuroscience and neuromedical fields 
neurotrans is our proprietary rap based technology program to research the delivery of therapeutics across the blood brain barrier 
we believe our neurotrans platform may provide therapies that will be safer  less intrusive and more effective than current approaches in treating a wide variety of brain disorders 
in preclinical studies  neurotrans has been conjugated to a variety of protein drugs  including enzymes and growth factors  without interfering with the function of either fusion partner 
studies indicate that radio labeled neurotrans may be transcytosed across the blood brain barrier and that fusions between neurotrans and therapeutic proteins may be manufactured economically 
experiments conducted in collaboration with stanford university in support the neurotrans peptide s ability to enhance the transport of cargo molecules into the cells that line the blood brain barrier 
in june  we entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement with f 
hoffman la roche ltd 
and hoffman la roche inc  or roche  to evaluate therapeutic delivery across the blood brain barrier utilizing neurotrans 
under the terms of the agreement  roche has funded studies of select molecules attached to neurotrans 
the agreement provides roche with an exclusive worldwide license to neurotrans for use in the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic molecules across the blood brain barrier 
roche s and our scientists are actively collaborating on the project 
we have received an initial upfront payment for the collaboration to cover our portion of the initial studies  and may earn development milestone payments and royalties in exchange for the licensing of neurotrans to roche 
wnttide for the potential treatment of cancer human mesd is a natural inhibitor of the receptor lrp lrp has recently been shown to play a role in the progression of some breast tumors 
studies in the laboratory of professor guojun bu  one of our scientific advisors  at the washington university in st 
louis medical school support the potential of mesd and related peptides to target these tumors 
these molecules and applications are licensed to us from washington university 
wnttide is our proprietary  mesd based peptide that we are developing as a potential therapeutic to inhibit the growth and metastasis of tumors over expressing lrp or lrp we have licensed the use of mesd from washington university for the potential treatment of cancer and bone density disorders 
in april  washington university conducted a preclinical study of wnttide in a breast cancer model which showed tumor inhibition 
the results of this study were presented at the nd annual wnt conference in washington  dc  in june and have been published in the peer reviewed publication  the proceedings of the national academy of sciences  on march  the paper  titled  lrp overexpression defines a class of breast cancer subtype and is a target for therapy  presented results that support the potential efficacy of wnttide as a targeted treatment for triple negative breast cancers  a particularly aggressive and difficult to treat indication for recurrent and metastatic disease 
abnormal wnt activation  found in to of breast cancers  is often associated with triple negative breast cancers 
we are currently evaluating wnttide in a preclinical breast cancer model to inhibit the wnt signaling pathway designed to block cancers dependent upon signaling through lrp  as well as other ind enabling studies 
tezampanel and ngx for the potential treatment of thrombotic disorder research conducted at johns hopkins university  or jhu  by craig morrell  dvm  dvm  and charles lowenstein  dvm demonstrated the importance of glutamate release in promoting platelet activation and thrombosis 
research shows that platelets treated with an ampa kainate receptor antagonist such as tezampanel or ngx are more resistant to glutamate induced aggregation than untreated platelets 
this identifies the ampa kainate receptors on platelets targeted by tezampanel or ngx as a new antithrombotic target with a different mechanism of action than plavix  aspirin or tpa 
we have licensed the intellectual property of tezampanel and ngx for the treatment of thrombotic disorder from jhu and are currently manufacturing drug product for a phase clinical trial in collaboration with a university hospital anticipated to commence in mid calendar other development areas securing additional and complementary technology licenses from others we plan to establish additional research collaborations with prominent universities and research labs currently working on the development of potential targeting molecules  and to secure licenses from these universities and labs for technology resulting from the collaboration 
no assurances can be made regarding our ability to establish such collaborations over the next months  or at all 
we intend to focus our in licensing and product candidate acquisition activities on identifying complementary therapeutics  therapeutic platforms that offer a number of therapeutic targets  and clinical stage therapeutics based on existing approved drugs in order to create proprietary reformulations to improve safety and efficacy or to expand such drugs clinical indications through additional clinical trials 
we may obtain these products through collaborations  joint ventures or through merger and or acquisitions with other biotechnology companies

in addition  we are obligated  among other things  to spend annually at least  for the development of products which we satisfied  as of august  and by spending approximately million and million  respectively  on such programs pursuant to the license agreement 
to date  we have accrued  in milestone payments to ucsd based upon the initiation of clinical trials in cystinosis and in nash 
to the extent that we fail to perform any of our obligations under the license agreement  ucsd may terminate the license or otherwise cause the license to become non ex clusive 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the us preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
we believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our consolidated financial statements is critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial position 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  prepaid expenses  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and capital lease liability  approximate fair value due to their short maturities 
cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
intangible assets intangible assets include the intellectual property and other rights relating to dr cysteamine  to the rap technology and to the out license and the rights to ngx acquired in the merger 
the intangible assets related to dr cysteamine and the rap technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years  which is the life of the intellectual property patents 
the year estimated useful life is also based upon the typical development  approval  marketing and life cycle management timelines of pharmaceutical drug products 
the intangible assets related to the out license will be amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years  which is the life of the intellectual property patents 
the intangible assets related to ngx  which has been classified as in process research and development  will not be amortized until development is completed 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the value of the purchase consideration over the identifiable assets acquired in the merger 
goodwill will be reviewed annually  or when an indication of impairment exists  to determine if any impairment analysis and resulting write down in valuation is necessary 
fixed assets fixed assets  which mainly consist of leasehold improvements  lab equipment  computer hardware and software and capital lease equipment  are stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the related estimated useful lives  except for leasehold improvements and capital lease equipment  which are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term 
significant additions and improvements that have useful lives estimated at greater than one year are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of the carrying amounts to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
should an impairment exist  the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset s fair value or discounted estimates of future cash flows 
we have not identified any such impairment losses to date 
common stock warrant liabilities the warrants issued in the private placement contain a cash out provision which may be triggered upon request by the warrant holders if we are acquired or upon the occurrence of certain other fundamental transactions involving our company 
this provision requires these warrants to be classified as liabilities and will be marked to market at each period end commencing on august  the warrants we issued in our december direct offering contain a conditional obligation that may require us to transfer assets to repurchase the warrants upon the occurrence of potential future events 
under the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity  or asc  a financial instrument that may requir e the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets is classified as a liability 
therefore  we have classified the warrants issued in the direct offering as liabilities and will mark them to fair value at each period end 
marked to market the warrants to purchase our common stock issued in our private placement and our direct offering are classified as liabilities under asc and are  therefore  re measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes income taxes are recorded under the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
research and development we are an early development stage company 
research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
research and development expenses include medical  clinical  regulatory and scientists salaries and benefits  lab collaborations  preclinical studies  clinical trials  clinical trial materials  regulatory and clinical consultants  lab supplies  lab services  lab equipment maintenance and small equipment purchased to support the research laboratory  amortization of intangible assets and allocated executive  human resources and facilities expenses 
in process research and development prior to september   we recorded in process research and development expense for a product candidate acquisition where there is not more than one potential product or usage for the assets being acquired 
upon the adoption of the revised guidance on business combinations  effective september   the fair value of acquired in process research and development is capitalized and tested for impairment at least annually

stock based compensation in february  our board of directors approved  and in march our stockholders approved  our equity incentive plan  or the plan  to grant up to an aggregate of  stock options or restricted stock or restricted stock units over the ten year life of the plan 
our board of directors has determined not to make any new grants under any of our former plans  but rather under the plan 
the plan s term is ten years and allows for the granting of options to employees  directors and consultants 
in may  raptor pharmaceuticals corp 
s stockholders approved the equity compensation plan  as amended  referred to herein as the plan 
the plan s term is ten years and allows for the granting of options to employees  directors and consultants 
effective as of the effective time of the merger  we assumed the outstanding stock options of raptor pharmaceuticals corp 
granted under the plan 
such assumed options are subject to the terms of the plan and  in each case  are also subject to the terms and conditions of an incentive stock option agreement  non qualified stock option agreement or other option award  as the case may be  issued under such plan 
prior to the merger  and subject to the merger becoming effective  our board of directors adopted the plan such that the plan became an equity incentive plan of ours after the merger 
typical option grants under the and plans are for ten years with exercise prices at or above market price based on the last closing price as of the date prior to the grant date on the relevant stock market or exchange and vest over four years as follows ths on the six month anniversary of the date of grant  and th per month thereafter 
effective september   our stock based compensation is accounted for in accordance with asc topic  accounting for compensation arrangements  or asc previously listed as statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  and related interpretations 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating future stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behavior 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be material ly impacted 
in march  the fasb issued asc previously listed as staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 or sab  which offers guidance for what was previously referred to as sfas r 
asc was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of sfas r while enhancing the information that investors receive 
asc creates a framework that is premised on two overarching themes a considerable judgment will be required by preparers to successfully implement sfas r  specifically when valuing employee stock options  and b reasonable individuals  acting in good faith  may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options 
key topics covered by asc include valuation models  expected volatility and expected term 
for the year ended august   stock based compensation expense was based on the black scholes option pricing model assuming the following risk free interest rate of to  to year expected life  to volatility  to turnover rate  and dividend rate 
we based our black scholes inputs on the following factors the risk free interest rate was based upon our review of current constant maturity treasury bill rates for seven and five years average  the expected life was based upon our assessment of the ten year term of the stock options issued along with the fact that we are a development stage company and our anticipation that option holders will exercise stock options when the company is at a more mature stage of development  the volatility was based on the actual volatility of our common stock price as quoted on nasdaq since the closing of our merger on september   the turnover rate was based on our assessment of our historical employee turnover  and the dividend rate was based on our current decision to not pay dividends on our stock at our current development stage 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in the application of asc  the compensation expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting for stock based compensation 
we recognize as consulting expense the fair value of options granted to persons who are neither employees nor directors 
stock options issued to consultants are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the fasb asc topic  equity based payments to non employees  or asc previously listed as emerging issues task force  or eitf  consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
the fair value of expensed options is based on the black scholes option pricing model assuming the same factors as stock based compensation expense discussed above

the timing and costs of development of our programs beyond the next months is highly uncertain and difficult to estimate 
see item a titled risk factors for further discussion about the risks and uncertainties pertaining to drug development 
in process research and development expenses in process research and development expenses decreased by million over the year ended august  due to the recording of the purchase of our conviviatm program during the year ended august  no such expense was incurred in the year ended august  in process research and development expenses were calculated based on the value of our stock issued in connection with the purchase of certain intellectual property rights to develop conviviatm mp for the treatment of acetaldehyde toxicity 
interest income interest income decreased by million during the year ended august  over the year ended august  due to the significant decrease in annual money market interest rates from an average of in to an average of less than in interest expense interest expense decreased by million in the year ended august  over the year ended august  due to the capitalized finder s fee of  shares of our common stock valued at  which was paid in connection with a convertible loan  which was amortized as interest expense from august to april  the term of the convertible loan 
no draws were made on the convertible loan prior to its expiration 
liquidity and capital resources capital resource requirements as of august   we had approximately million in cash  approximately million in current liabilities of which million represented the non cash common stock warrant liability and approximately million of net working capital deficit 
our forecasted average monthly cash expenditures for the next twelve months are approximately million 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents as of november  of million will be sufficient to meet our obligations into december we are currently in the process of negotiating strategic partnerships  collaborations and potential equity sales to supplement the funding of our preclinical and clinical programs beyond december 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital when needed  we may be forced to scale down our expenditures 
our recurring losses from operations and our accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and  as a result  our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended august  with respect to this uncertainty 
we may need to generate significant revenue or raise additional capital to continue to operate as a going concern beyond december in addition  the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital 
the sale of additional securities is likely to result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available when needed in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
we may be unable to raise additional financing due to a variety of factors  including our financial condition  the status of our research and development programs  and the general condition of the financial markets 
if we fail to raise additional financing when needed  we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development programs  our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected and we may have to scale back our operations 
in august  raptor pharmaceuticals corp 
entered into a securities purchase agreement with four investors for the private placement of units at a purchase price of per unit 
each unit was comprised of one share of our common stock  par value per share and one warrant to purchase one half of one share of our common stock 
at the closing  raptor pharmaceuticals corp 
sold an aggregate of  units to the investors  comprised of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to in the aggregate   shares of our common stock  for aggregate gross proceeds of  the investor warrants  exercisable for two years from the closing  had an exercise price of per share during the first year and per share during the second year  depending on when such investor warra nts were exercised  if at all 
to date  warrants to purchase  shares were exercised for aggregate gross proceeds of  the balance of warrants to purchase  of our common stock remain outstanding as of november  in december  we entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement  or the direct offering purchase agreement  dated as of december   with investors collectively  the direct offering investors with respect to the sale of units  whereby  on an aggregate basis  the investors agreed to purchase  units for a negotiated purchase price of per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
each unit consists of one share of our common stock  one series a warrant exercisable for of a share of our common stock and one series b warrant exercisable for of a share of our common stock 
the shares of our common stock and the warrants were issued separately 
the series a warrants exercisable for an aggregat e  shares of our common stock were exercisable commencing on june  and ending december  the series b warrants exercisable for an aggregate  shares of our common stock were exercisable commencing on june  and ending june  the investor warrants have a per share exercise price of 
in connection with this offering we paid a placement agent cash compensation equal to of the gross proceeds or  plus a five year warrant at an exercise price of per share for the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
to date series b warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock were exercised for aggregate gross proceeds of  as of november   there were series a warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock and series b warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock outstanding 
in april  we entered into a million equity line facility with lpc  which allows us to sell shares of our common stock every two days if our selling price to the investor is over per share 
cumulatively  as of november   we have sold approximately million shares under the equity line raising approximately million 
we may direct lpc to purchase up to an additional million of shares of our common stock under the lpc purchase agreement over the next months  generally in amounts of up to  every business days 
however  lpc does not have the right nor the obligation to purchase any shares of our common stock on any business day that the purchase price of our common stock is less than per share 
although we have the right to sell additional shares of our common stock to lpc under the lpc purchase agreement  we are restricted from making such sale under the private placement purchase agreement until november  on august   we entered into the private placement purchase agreements with the private placement investors for the private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock  at a purchase price of per unit  with each unit comprised of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock 
we issued and sold an aggregate of  units  comprised of an aggregate of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million 
each warrant  exercisable for years from august   has an exercise price of per share 
as the placement agent for the private placement  the placement agent was issued one warrant to purchase  share s of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  paid a cash commission of  and reimbursed for certain of its expenses incurred in connection with the private placement 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds required for our continued operation 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not able to obtain financing on a timely basis  we will not be able to meet our obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business 
this also may be the case if we become insolvent or if we breach our asset purchase agreement with biomarin or our licensing agreements with washington university and ucsd due to non payment and we do not cure our non payment within the stated cure period 
if this happens  we would lose all rights to the rap technology assigned to us by biomarin and or the rights to mesd license d to us by washington university and or the rights to dr cysteamine licensed to us by ucsd  depending on which agreement is breached 
if we lose our rights to the intellectual property related to the rap technology purchased by us from biomarin  our agreement with roche would likely be terminated and any milestone or royalty payments from roche to us would thereafter cease to accrue 
for the next months we intend to expend a total of approximately million to implement our operating plan of researching and developing our dr cysteamine clinical programs  our rap based platform  our licensed technologies  as well as continuing business development efforts for our other clinical stage product candidates 
specifically  we estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next months to be as follows estimated spending for the next months in millions research and development activities research and development compensation and benefits general and administrative activities general and administrative compensation and benefits capital expenditures total estimated spending for the next months we anticipate that we will not be able to generate revenues from the sale of products until we further develop our drug product candidates and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market our future drug product candidates  which could take several years or more  if we are able to do so at all 
accordingly  our cash flow projections are subject to numerous contingencies and risk factors beyond our control  including successfully developing our drug product candidates  market acceptance of our drug product candidates  competition from well funded competitors  and our ability to manage our expected growth 
it is likely that for many years  we will not be able to generate internal positive cash flow from the sales of our drug product candidates sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements 
there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long term financing  the successful development of our drug product candidates and related technologies  the successful and sufficient market acceptance of any product offerings that we may introduce and  finally  the achievement of a profitable level of operations 
the issuance of additional equity securities by us is likely to result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders 
obtaining commercial loans  assuming those loans would be available  including on acceptable terms  will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments 
research and development activities we plan to conduct further research and development  seek to support several clinical trials for dr cysteamine  improve upon our rap based and in licensed technology and continue business development efforts for our other clinical stage product candidates in the next months 
we plan to conduct research and development activities by our own laboratory staff and also by engaging contract research organizations  clinical research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations 
we also plan to incur costs for the production of our clinical study drug candidate  dr cysteamine  clinical trials  clinical and medical advisors and consulting and collaboration fees 
we anticipate our research and development costs for the next months  excluding in house research and development compensation  will be approximately million 
officer and employee compensation we have five executive officers  one permanent scientific staff member  three permanent clinical development staff members and one permanent finance staff member 
we anticipate spending up to approximately million in officer and employee compensation during the next months  of which million is allocated to research and development expenses and million is allocated to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative we anticipate spending approximately million on general and administrative costs in the next months 
these costs will consist primarily of legal and accounting fees  patent legal fees  investor relations expenses  board fees and expenses  insurance  rent and facility support expenses  excluding finance and administrative compensation 
capital expenditures we anticipate spending approximately  in the next months on capital expenditures for lab equipment and office furniture 
contractual obligations with biomarin pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement we entered into with biomarin for the purchase of intellectual property related to our rap based technology including neurotranstm  we are obligated to make the following milestone payments to biomarin upon the achievement of the following events  paid by us in june within days after we receive total aggregate debt or equity financing of at least   paid by us in june within days after we receive total aggregate debt or equity financing of at least   upon our filing and acceptance of an investigational new drug application for a drug product candidate based on our neurotranstm product candidate   upon our successful completion of a phase human clinical trial for a drug product candidate based on our neurotranstm product candidate   upon our successful completion of a phase human clinical trial for a drug product candidate based on our neurotranstm product candidate   within days of our obtaining marketing approval from the fda or other similar regulatory agencies for a drug product candidate based on our neurotranstm product candidate   within days of our obtaining marketing approval from the fda or other similar regulatory agencies for a second drug product candidate based on our neurotranstm product candidate   within days after the end of the first calendar year in which our aggregated revenues derived from drug product candidates based on our neurotranstm product candidate exceed  and  within days after the end of the first calendar year in which our aggregated revenues derived from drug product candidates based on our neurotranstm product candidate exceed  in addition to these milestone payments  we are also obligated to pay biomarin a royalty at a percentage of our aggregated revenues derived from drug product candidates based on our neurotranstm product candidate 
on june   we made a milestone payment in the amount of  to biomarin because we raised  in our may  private placement financing 
if we become insolvent or if we breach our asset purchase agreement with biomarin due to non payment and we do not cure our non payment within the stated cure period  all of our rights to rap technology including neurotranstm will revert back to biomarin
