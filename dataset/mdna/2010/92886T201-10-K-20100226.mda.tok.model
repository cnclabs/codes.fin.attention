item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors  including the factors we describe under item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of high quality voice and messaging services over broadband networks 
our technology serviced approximately million subscriber lines as of december  while customers in the united states represented of our subscriber lines at december   we also serve customers in canada and in the united kingdom 
our residential and small and home office services are portable and we enable our customers to make and receive phone calls with a telephone almost anywhere a broadband internet connection is available 
we transmit these calls using voice over internet protocol  or voip  technology  which converts voice signals into digital data packets for transmission over the internet 
at a cost effective rate  each of our calling plans provides a number of basic features typically offered by traditional telephone service providers  plus a wide range of enhanced features that we believe differentiate our service and offer an attractive value proposition to our customers 
we also offer a number of premium services for additional fees 
we rely heavily on our network  which is a flexible  scalable session initiation protocol sip based voip network that rides on top of the internet 
this platform enables a user via a single identity to access and utilize services and features regardless of how they are connected to the internet 
as a result  with one identity  either a number or user name  customers have access to vonage voice  messaging  features and personal profile information regardless of location  device or how they access the internet  including over g  g  cable or dsl broadband networks 
in august we launched vonage world  a residential plan that includes unlimited calling to more than countries  including india  mexico and china for the current flat monthly rate of 
in addition  the vonage world offer includes unlimited vonage visual voicemail  which provides readable voicemail delivered via email or short message service sms text message 
in october  we launched vonage mobile  our first mobile calling application for smart phones 
vonage mobile is a free downloadable application that provides seamless  low cost pay per use international calling while on wi fi or cellular networks  depending on the device 
in december  we began offering vonage world mobile using this mobile calling application 
bundle discounts are provided for customers who subscribe to both our residential and mobile vonage world plans 
vonage has developed both a direct sales channel  as represented by web sites and toll free numbers  and a retail distribution channel through regional and national retailers  including wal mart 
the direct and retail distribution channels are supported through integrated advertising campaigns across multiple media such as online  television  direct mail  alternative media  telemarketing  partner marketing and customer referral programs 
our primary source of revenue is subscription fees that we charge customers for our service plans  primarily on a monthly basis 
we also generate revenue from international calls customers make that are not included in their service plan and for additional features that customers add to their service plans 
trends in our industry and key operating data a number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements 
also  the table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of our business for the years ended december  gross subscriber line additions change in net subscriber lines subscriber lines at period end average monthly customer churn average monthly revenue per line average monthly telephony services revenue per line average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line marketing costs per gross subscriber line addition employees excluding temporary help at period end vonage annual report 
table of contents broadband adoption 
the number of us households with broadband internet access has grown significantly 
we expect this trend to continue 
we benefit from this trend because our service requires a broadband internet connection and our potential addressable market increases as broadband adoption increases 
changing competitive landscape 
we are facing increasing competition from other companies that offer multiple services such as cable television  video services  voice and broadband internet service 
these competitors are offering voip or other voice services as part of a bundle 
in addition  certain competitors have developed integrated offerings that we cannot provide and that may be more attractive to customers 
for example  as wireless providers offer more minutes at lower prices and companion landline alternative services  their services have become more attractive to households as a replacement for wire line service 
we also compete against established alternative voice communication providers and independent voip service providers 
some of these service providers may choose to sacrifice telephony revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at lower prices or for free 
gross subscriber line additions 
gross subscriber line additions for a particular period are calculated by taking the net subscriber line additions during that particular period and adding to that the number of subscriber lines that terminated during that period 
this number does not include subscriber lines both added and terminated during the period  where termination occurred within the first days after activation 
the number does include  however  subscriber lines added during the period that are terminated within days of activation but after the end of the period 
net subscriber line additions 
net subscriber line additions for a particular period reflect the number of subscriber lines at the end of the period  less the number of subscriber lines at the beginning of the period 
subscriber lines 
our subscriber lines include  as of a particular date  all subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date 
our subscriber lines include fax lines and softphones but do not include our virtual phone numbers or toll free numbers  which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers 
as part of a database review  we identified  subscriber lines that did not meet the criteria for inclusion as subscriber lines as of december  we recorded an adjustment as of january  for these lines which we considered to be immaterial to the current and prior periods 
this adjustment had no impact to our financial statements but will impact per line metrics 
subscriber lines including this adjustment decreased from  as of december  to  as of december  in the fourth quarter of  we had a net loss of  subscriber lines 
excluding the adjustment  we believe that the decrease in our subscriber lines was primarily due to increasing wireless substitution  competition  particularly from cable companies  worsening economic conditions  and reduced marketing spend during the second half of average monthly customer churn 
average monthly customer churn for a particular period is calculated by dividing the number of customers that terminated during that period by the simple average number of customers during the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period  plus the number of customers on the last day of the period  divided by two 
terminations  as used in the calculation of churn statistics  do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first days after activation 
our average monthly customer churn remained consistent at for and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  our average monthly customer churn was 
we monitor churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction 
other companies may calculate churn differently  and their churn data may not be directly comparable to ours 
customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not 
our churn will fluctuate over time due to increased competitive pressures including wireless substitution  market place perception of our services and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services 
average monthly revenue per line 
average monthly revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period  plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period  divided by two 
our average monthly revenue per line increased to for compared to for this increase was due primarily to pricing actions that we have taken in the past year 
average monthly telephony services revenue per line 
average monthly telephony services revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total telephony services revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
our average monthly telephony services revenue per line was for compared with for this increase was due primarily to pricing actions that we have taken in the past year 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our direct cost of telephony services for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
we use the average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line to evaluate how effective we are at managing our costs of providing service 
our average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line decreased to for compared to for due primarily to favorable rates negotiated with our service providers 
these improvements were partially offset by costs from higher international call volume associated with vonage world 
direct cost of telephony services is expected to increase in as customer demand for vonage world continues to grow 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition is calculated by dividing our marketing expense for a particular period by the number of gross subscriber line additions during the period 
marketing expense does not include the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions  which are accounted for as an offset to revenues  or customer equipment subsidies  which are accounted for as direct cost of goods sold 
as a result  it does not represent the full cost to us of obtaining a new customer 
our marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition 
table of contents increased to for from in due primarily to a reduction in gross subscriber line additions compared to the prior year primarily due to worsening economic conditions  increasing competition and customer acquisition and targeting efforts not being as effective as planned 
employees 
employees represent the number of personnel that are on our payroll and exclude temporary or outsourced labor 
regulation 
our business has developed in an environment largely free from regulation 
the united states and other countries  however  are examining how voip services should be regulated  and a number of initiatives could have an impact on our business 
for example  the fcc has concluded that wire line broadband internet access  such as dsl and internet access provided by cable companies  is an information service and is subject to lighter regulation than telecommunications services 
this order may give providers of wire line broadband internet access the right to discriminate against our services  charge their customers an extra fee to use our service or block our service 
in august  however  the fcc found that a major cable operator s network management practices  which had the effect of degrading certain applications  were not allowed under the fcc s network neutrality policy statement 
the cable operator is currently appealing the fcc s decision in the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit 
in september  the chairman of the fcc announced his intention to adopt the principles in the fcc s network neutrality policy statement as formal rules 
he also proposed adding two new principles to the formal rules  including an explicit non discrimination principle and a transparency principle  which requires broadband providers to disclose network management practices to consumers  content providers  and application providers 
also the chairman s proposed rules would apply to both wire line and wireless carrier broadband networks 
it was not clear whether the network neutrality policy statement applied to wireless carrier broadband networks 
if the chairman s proposed rules are adopted  vonage may have expanded opportunities to provide voip service over wireless carrier broadband networks 
given these recent developments  we believe it is unlikely that blocking or discrimination by broadband network operators will occur on a widespread basis  but if it does  it would have a material adverse effect on us

operating revenues operating revenues consists of telephony services revenue and customer equipment and shipping revenue 
telephony services revenue 
substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenue 
in the united states  we have four residential plans  vonage world  residential premium unlimited  vonage pro and basic  two mobile plans  vonage world mobile and vonage mobile pay per use and two small office and home office calling plans  small business premium unlimited minutes and small business basic minutes 
each of our unlimited plans offers unlimited domestic calling as well as unlimited calling to puerto rico  canada and selected european countries  subject to certain restrictions  and each of our basic plans offers a limited number of domestic calling minutes per month 
we also offer international calling plans that are bundled with our residential premium unlimited plan where a customer can make calls to a chosen international region 
we offer similar plans in canada and the united kingdom 
the vonage world plan launched in august offers unlimited calling across the us and puerto rico  unlimited international calling to over sixty countries including india  mexico and canada  subject to certain restrictions  and free voicemail to text messages with vonage visual voicemail 
under our basic plans  we charge on a per minute basis when the number of domestic calling minutes included in the plan is exceeded for a particular month 
international calls except for calls to puerto rico  canada and certain european countries under our unlimited plans and a variety of countries under international calling plans and vonage world are charged on a per minute basis 
these per minute fees are not included in our monthly subscription fees 
in october  we launched vonage mobile  our first mobile calling application for smart phones 
vonage mobile is a free downloadable application that provides seamless  low cost pay per use international calling while on wi fi or cellular networks  depending on the device 
in december  we began offering vonage world mobile using this mobile calling application 
bundle discounts are provided for customers who subscribe to both our residential and mobile vonage world plans 
we derive most of our telephony services revenue from monthly subscription fees that we charge our customers under our service plans 
we also offer residential fax service  virtual phone numbers  toll free numbers and other services  for each of which we charge an additional monthly fee 
one business fax line is included with each of our two small office and home office plans  but we charge monthly fees for additional business fax lines 
we automatically charge these fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards and electronic check payments  or ecp  monthly in advance 
we also automatically charge the per minute fees not included in our monthly subscription fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards or ecp monthly in arrears unless they exceed a certain dollar threshold  in which case they are charged immediately 
by collecting monthly subscription fees in advance and certain other charges immediately after they are incurred  we are able to reduce the amount of accounts receivable that we have outstanding  thus allowing us to have lower working capital requirements 
collecting in this manner also helps us mitigate bad debt losses  which are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
if a customer s credit card  debit card or ecp is declined  we generally suspend international calling capabilities as well as the customer s ability to incur domestic usage charges in excess of their plan minutes 
historically  in most cases  we are able to correct the problem with the customer within the current monthly billing cycle 
if the customer s credit card  debit card or ecp could not be successfully processed during three billing cycles ie the current and two subsequent monthly billing cycles  we terminate the account 
we also generate revenue by charging a fee for activating service but from time to time we may forgo collecting this fee 
for example  since may we have waived activation fees for almost all new customers 
in these instances when no activation fee is being collected  no customer acquisition costs are deferred 
customer activation fees when collected  along with the related incremental direct customer acquisition amounts for customer equipment in the direct channel and for rebates and retailer commissions in the retail channel  up to but not exceeding the vonage annual report 
table of contents activation fee  are deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer relationship period 
the amortization of deferred customer equipment is recorded to direct cost of goods sold 
the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction of telephony services revenues 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense 
the average customer relationship period was months in  months in and months in for  the average customer relationship period will be further reduced to months based upon further analysis of historical trends 
the impact of these changes to the average customer relationship period is not material to the consolidated results of operations 
in the united states  we charge regulatory recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray the costs associated with regulatory consulting and compliance as well as related litigation  e compliance and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services 
in addition  we recognize revenue on a gross basis for contributions to the federal universal service fund  or usf  and related fees 
all other taxes are recorded on a net basis 
in addition  we charge a disconnect fee for customers who terminate their service plan within the first twelve months of service 
disconnect fees are recorded as revenue and are recognized at the time the customer terminates service 
telephony services revenue is offset by the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions 
customer equipment and shipping revenue 
customer equipment and shipping revenue consists of revenue from sales of customer equipment to our wholesalers or directly to customers and retailers 
in addition  customer equipment and shipping revenue includes the fees when collected that we charge our customers for shipping any equipment to them 
in addition  we charge an equipment recovery fee for customers who terminate their service plan within the first twelve months of service 
equipment recovery fees are recorded as revenue and are recognized at the time the customer terminates service 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of direct cost of telephony services  royalties  direct cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expense  marketing expense and depreciation and amortization 
total direct cost of telephony services 
total direct cost of telephony services primarily consists of fees that we pay to third parties on an ongoing basis in order to provide our services 
these fees include access charges that we pay to other telephone companies to terminate domestic and international calls on the public switched telephone network 
these costs represented approximately and of our total direct cost of telephony services for and  respectively  with a portion of these payments ultimately being made to incumbent telephone companies 
when a vonage subscriber calls another vonage subscriber  we do not pay an access charge 
the cost of leasing internet transit services from multiple internet service providers 
this internet connectivity is used to carry voip session initiation signaling and packetized audio media between our subscribers and our regional data centers 
the cost of leasing from other telephone companies the telephone numbers that we provide to our customers 
we lease these telephone numbers on a monthly basis 
the cost of co locating our regional data connection point equipment in third party facilities owned by other telephone companies  internet service providers or collocation facility providers 
the cost of providing local number portability  which allows customers to move their existing telephone numbers from another provider to our service

table of contents telephony services revenue 
telephony services revenue generally has increased on a quarterly basis with the exception of the third and fourth quarters of and second quarter of the reduction in telephony services revenue in the third quarter of was related to an increase in promotional activity and customer credits issued primarily for customer retention 
the decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of was due to a decline in both the canadian dollar and british pound 
the decrease in revenue in the second quarter of was due to a decline in number of subscriber lines 
during the third quarter of we introduced the vonage world plan resulting in increased telephony services revenue for the second half of direct costs of telephony services 
direct costs of telephony services have remained consistent each quarter but are expected to increase as seen in the fourth quarter of due to higher international call volume following the introduction of our vonage world plan 
direct cost of goods sold 
the fluctuations in direct cost of goods sold expenses between the quarters was due to the mix in the type of customer equipment sold and the fluctuations in the subscriber line additions 
in addition in and there were incremental costs from the reduction in the period over which deferred customer equipment costs are amortized 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses generally have decreased on a quarterly basis  in  selling  general and administrative cost declined primarily due a decrease in professional fees  salaries  recruiting and outsourced temporary labor 
for  selling  general and administrative cost declined primarily due to the reduction in legal and consulting costs 
marketing 
marketing expense declined in  primarily driven by reduced marketing spending as we completed the transition to our new agencies and continued the development of new advertising and eliminated inefficient non media spending 
liquidity and capital resources overview the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated for the years ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities for the year ended december   we generated income from operations and positive operating cash flow 
historically  we have generated negative or breakeven cash flows from operations 
our primary sources of funds have been proceeds from private placements of our preferred stock  private placements of convertible notes and borrowings under credit facilities  an initial public offering of our common stock  operating revenues and borrowings under notes payable from our principal stockholder and chairman  which were subsequently converted into shares of our preferred stock 
we have used these proceeds for working capital  funding operating losses  ip litigation settlements  repaying our prior convertible notes and other general corporate purposes 
although our historical net losses were driven primarily by start up costs and the cost of developing our technology  more recently our results of operations have been impacted by investments in marketing  settlement of our ip litigation and refinancing costs 
in addition to marketing  we plan to continue to invest in developing new products  our network infrastructure and customer care 
in  we announced a plan seeking to balance growth with profitability 
we intend to continue to pursue growth because we believe it will position us as a strong competitor in the long term 
although we believe we will achieve consistent profitability in the future  we ultimately may not be successful and we may never achieve consistent profitability 
we believe that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will fund our operations for at least the next twelve months

third lien convertible notes subject to conversion  repayment or repurchase of the convertible notes  the convertible notes mature in october subject to customary anti dilution adjustments including triggers upon the issuance of common stock below the market price of the common stock or the conversion price of the convertible notes  the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a rate equal to  shares for each  principal amount of convertible notes  or approximately per share 
a permanent increase in the conversion rate  resulting in the issuance of additional shares  may occur if a fundamental change occurs 
during the year ended december   we received notices of conversion from certain note holders indicating their desire to convert their convertible notes 
in the aggregate  principal amount of convertible notes were converted into  shares of our common stock

our capital expenditures for the year ended were  of which  was for software acquisition and development 
for  we believe our capital expenditures will be approximately  operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased to  during the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year period  primarily due to lower marketing expenditures and overall tighter controls on costs partially offset by lower revenues as our overall customer base has decreased over the past year and higher interest expense associated with our november financing

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

table of contents on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including the following those related to the average period of service to a customer the customer relationship period used to amortize deferred activation fees and deferred customer acquisition costs associated with customer activation  the useful lives of property and equipment  software and intangible assets  assumptions used for the purpose of determining share based compensation and the estimated fair value of our stock warrant using the black scholes option pricing model model  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
the key inputs for this model are our stock price at valuation date  exercise price  the dividend yield  risk free interest rate  life in years and volatility  and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative within our convertible notes using the monte carlo simulation model 
the key inputs are maturity date  risk free interest rate  current share price and historical volatility of our common stock 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available market information  appropriate valuation methodologies  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition operating revenues consist of telephony services revenues and customer equipment which enables our telephony services and shipping revenues 
the point in time at which revenues are recognized is determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and fasb asc  revenue recognition 
substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenues  which are derived primarily from monthly subscription fees that customers are charged under our service plans 
we also derive telephony services revenues from per minute fees for international calls and for any calling minutes in excess of a customer s monthly plan limits 
monthly subscription fees are automatically charged to customers credit cards  debit cards or ecp in advance and are recognized over the following month when services are provided 
revenues generated from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans are recognized as services are provided  that is  as minutes are used  and are billed to a customer s credit cards  debit cards or ecp in arrears 
as a result of our multiple billing cycles each month  we estimate the amount of revenues earned from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily upon historical minutes and have been consistent with our actual results 
we also generate revenue by charging a fee for activating service but from time to time we may forgo collecting this fee 
for example  since may we have waived activation fees for almost all new customers 
in these instances when no activation fee is being collected  no customer acquisition costs are deferred 
customer activation fees when collected  along with the related incremental direct customer acquisition amounts for customer equipment in the direct channel and for rebates and retailer commissions in the retail channel  up to but not exceeding the activation fee  are deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer relationship period 
the amortization of deferred customer equipment is recorded to direct cost of goods sold 
the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction of telephony services revenues 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense 
the average customer relationship period was months in  months in and months in for  the average customer relationship period will be further reduced to months based upon further analysis of historical trends 
the impact of these changes to the average customer relationship period is not material to the consolidated results of operations 
we also provide rebates to customers who purchase their customer equipment from retailers and satisfy minimum service period requirements 
these rebates in excess of activation fees are recorded as a reduction of revenues over the service period based upon the estimated number of customers that will ultimately earn and claim the rebates 
customer equipment and shipping revenues include sales to our retailers  who subsequently resell this customer equipment to customers 
revenues were reduced for payments to retailers and rebates to customers  who purchased their customer equipment through these retailers  to the extent of customer equipment and shipping revenues 
inventory inventory consists of the cost of customer equipment and is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the average cost method 
we provide an inventory allowance for customer equipment that has been returned by customers but may not be able to be re issued to new customers or returned to the manufacturer for credit 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on the assumption that it is more likely than not that we will not generate taxable income in the future 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for us federal and state tax purposes of  and  respectively  expiring at various times from years ending through in addition  we had net operating loss carry forwards for canadian tax purposes of  expiring through we also had net operating loss carry forwards for united kingdom tax purposes of  with no expiration date 
under section of the internal revenue code  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period  the corporation s ability to use its pre change of control net operating loss carry forward and other pre change tax attributes against its post change income may be limited 
the vonage annual report 
table of contents section limitation is applied annually so as to limit the use of our pre change net operating loss carryforwards to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long term tax exempt rate 
in addition  we may be able to increase the base section limitation amount during the first five years following the ownership change to the extent it realizes built in gains during that time period 
a built in gain generally is gain or income attributable to an asset that was held at the date of the ownership change and that had a fair market value in excess of the tax basis at the date of the ownership change 
section provides that any unused section limitation amount can be carried forward and aggregated with the following year s available net operating losses 
due to the cumulative impact of our equity issuances over the three year period ended april  a change of ownership occurred upon the issuance of our previously outstanding series e preferred stock at the end of april as a result   of the total us net operating losses will be subject to an annual base limitation of  as noted above  we believe we may be able to increase the base section limitation for built in gains during the first five years following the ownership change 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this pronouncement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  reduced as appropriate based on estimated forfeitures  and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award using the accelerated method

asu revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force eitf 
this asu provides amendments to the criteria in fasb asc for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
asu changes existing rules regarding recognition of revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements and expands ongoing disclosures about the significant judgments used in applying its guidance 
it will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal year beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted on a prospective or retrospective basis 
we are currently evaluating the impact of asu on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb affirmed the consensus of fasb asc  debt with conversion and other options including partial cash settlement  which applies to all convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature  which means that such convertible debt instruments  by their terms  may be settled either wholly or partially in cash upon conversion 
fasb asc requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner reflective of the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
previous guidance provided for accounting for this type of convertible debt instrument entirely as debt 
fasb asc was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of fasb asc did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb asc  general intangibles other than goodwill 
fasb asc amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under fasb asc this new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations after their acquisitions 
fasb asc was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  since this guidance applied prospectively  on adoption  there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb amended fasb asc  which delayed the effective date of fasb asc for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
these nonfinancial items include assets and liabilities such as reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign exchange risk we sell our products and services in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the valuation in our financial statements of the assets and liabilities of these operations 
we also have a portion of our sales denominated in euros  the canadian dollar and the british pound  which are also affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  although foreign exchange risks have not been material to our financial position or results of operations to date 
interest rate and debt risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt and to a lesser degree investments

by policy  we limited the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
during  due to the economic downturn in the banking industry and in anticipation of the use of cash on hand to repay a portion of our previous convertible notes in november  management decided to convert all of our marketable securities into cash
