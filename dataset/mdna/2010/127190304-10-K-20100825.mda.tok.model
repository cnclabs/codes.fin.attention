item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of  and should be read together with  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
unless otherwise specifically noted  all years refer to our fiscal year which ends on june overview we are a leading provider of professional services and information technology solutions to the us government 
we derived percent of our revenue during the year ended june  from contracts 
table of contents with us government agencies  including percent from dod customers  and percent from us federal civilian agency customers including the department of homeland security 
we also provide services to state and local governments and commercial customers 
for the year ended june   percent of our us government revenue was from contracts where we were the lead  or prime  contractor 
our contract base has approximately active contracts and  active task orders 
we have a diverse mix of contract types  with percent  percent  and percent of our revenue for the year ended june   derived from t m  cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts  respectively 
we generally do not pursue fixed price software development contracts that may create financial risk 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the following are considered our critical accounting policies revenue recognition contract accounting we generate almost all of our revenue from three different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts  t m contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for cost plus fee contracts that include performance based fee incentives  and that are subject to the provisions of accounting standards codification asc section  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts asc  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance 
for such cost plus fee contracts subject to the provisions of asc  revenue recognition sec materials asc  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
revenue on t m contracts is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered for services provided  to the extent of material cost for products delivered to customers  and to the extent of expenses incurred on behalf of the customers 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customers are recognized as revenue at the time products are delivered to the customers 
we have four basic categories of fixed price contracts fixed unit price  fixed price level of effort  fixed price completion  and fixed price license 
revenue on fixed unit price contracts  where specified units of output under service arrangements are delivered  is recognized as units are delivered based on the specified price per unit 
revenue on fixed unit price maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the length of the service period 
revenue for fixed price level of effort contracts is recognized based upon the number of units of labor actually delivered multiplied by the agreed rate for each unit of labor 
a significant portion of our fixed price completion contracts involve the design and development of complex client systems 
for these contracts that are within the scope of asc  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method using costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
for fixed price completion contracts that are not within the scope of asc  revenue is generally recognized ratably over the service period 
our fixed price license agreements and related services contracts are primarily executed in our international operations 
as the agreements to deliver software require significant production  modification or customization of software  revenue is recognized using the contract accounting guidance of asc for agreements to deliver data under license and related services  revenue is recognized as the data is delivered and services are performed 
except for losses on contracts accounted for under asc  provisions for 
table of contents estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period such losses are determined 
losses on contracts accounted for under asc are recognized as the services and materials are provided 
our contracts may include the provision of more than one of our services 
in these situations  revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values  with proper consideration given to the guidance provided by other authoritative literature 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenue and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor  subcontracting costs  and other direct costs  as well as an allocation of allowable indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
estimates of award fees for certain contracts may also be a factor in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
long term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business  and therefore the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods are material 
for our federal contracts  we follow us government procurement and accounting standards in assessing the allowability and the allocability of costs to contracts 
due to the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business operations personnel conduct periodic contract status and performance reviews 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenue or costs are required  any significant changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the current period 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business operations personnel performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are scrutinized for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the dcaa 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents 
we have a formal review process for approving any such work 
revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
we base our estimates on previous experiences with the client  communications with the client regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
costs of revenue costs of revenue include all direct contract costs as well as indirect overhead costs and selling  general and administrative expenses that are allowable and allocable to contracts under federal procurement standards 
costs of revenue also include costs and expenses that are unallowable under applicable procurement standards  and thus are not allocable to contracts for billing purposes 
such costs and expenses do not directly generate revenue  but are necessary for business operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts management establishes bad debt reserves against certain billed receivables based upon the latest information available to determine whether invoices are ultimately collectible 
whenever judgment is involved in 
table of contents determining the estimates  there is the potential for bad debt expense and the fair value of accounts receivable to be misstated 
given that we primarily serve the us government and that  in our opinion  we have sufficient controls in place to properly recognize revenue  we believe the risk to be relatively low that a misstatement of accounts receivable would have a material impact on our financial results 
accounts receivable balances are written off when the balance is deemed uncollectible after exhausting all reasonable means of collection 
goodwill valuation goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or if impairment indicators are present 
the evaluation includes comparing the fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit may be impaired 
impairment is measured by comparing the derived fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value 
separately identifiable intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators are present 
we have two reporting units domestic operations and international operations 
our reporting units are the same as our operating segments 
approximately percent of our goodwill is attributable to our domestic operations 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using both an income approach and a market approach 
the valuation process considers our estimates of the future operating performance of each reporting unit 
companies in similar industries are researched and analyzed and we consider the domestic and international economic and financial market conditions  both in general and specific to the industry in which we operate  prevailing as of the valuation date 
the income approach utilizes discounted cash flows 
we calculate a weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit in order to estimate the discounted cash flows 
we perform our annual testing for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as of june of each year 
the fair value of each of our reporting units as of june  exceeded its carrying value by more than percent 
stock based compensation under our stock incentive plan  we issue equity instruments on an annual basis to our directors and key employees 
these instruments may take the form of  among others  shares of restricted stock  restricted stock units rsus  stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars and non qualified stock options nqsos 
we also issue equity instruments in the form of rsus under our management stock purchase plan and director stock purchase plan 
with the exception of ssars that were granted in june and july of to the company s chief executive officer  president  us operations  and chief operating officer  us operations with a market based vesting feature  the fair value attributable to ssars and nqsos is generally computed using the black scholes valuation model 
ssars containing market based vesting features were valued with a binomial lattice model 
prior to june  we issued equity instruments to our key employees in the form of nqsos and either rsus or restricted stock 
effective in june  we began issuing ssars instead of nqsos 
rsus and shares of restricted stock granted through june vest based on the passage of time and continued services as an employee 
for our annual grants made in august and august  we issued rsus for which vesting is based on achievement of a performance metric in addition to grantee service performance based rsus 
vesting is initially dependent upon our net after tax profit natp for a specified fiscal year 
the maximum number of performance based rsus which will vest is based on the achievement of a certain natp which has been established by our board of directors 
no performance based rsus will vest if natp is less than a pre defined amount 
in addition to achievement of a certain level of natp  vesting is contingent upon the grantee s service 
once the natp for the applicable fiscal year is determined  performance based rsus vest in annual increments beginning one or two years after the grant date 
all performance based rsus awarded for a given natp level and for which service requirements are fulfilled will have fully vested four years after the grant date 

table of contents under the terms of the various equity instrument agreements  vesting of awards may accelerate to varying degrees based on the age of the grantee and the type of equity instrument 
depending on the instrument  vesting may accelerate upon retirement at either age or with the amount of acceleration based on the length of service provided and  for performance based rsus  the natp achieved for the applicable fiscal year

revenue for fy  our total revenue increased by million  or percent 
approximately percent  or million  of revenue growth was organic and resulted from an increase in services provided to a broad base of dod  intelligence  and federal civilian agency customers 
the remaining percent increase  or million  was from acquisitions completed in fy and fy 
table of contents during fy  total revenue increased by million  or percent 
approximately percent  or million  of revenue growth was organic and resulted primarily from increases in services and solutions provided to our dod customers 
the remaining percent  or million  of the fy revenue growth was generated by acquisitions completed in fy and fy revenue generated from the date a business is acquired through the first anniversary of that date is considered acquired revenue 
our acquired revenue for fy and fy is as follows in millions business acquired systemware incorporated athena innovative solutions  inc dragon development corporation others total the following table summarizes revenue earned by each of the customer groups for the three most recent fiscal years year ended june  dollar amounts in thousands department of defense federal civilian agencies commercial and other state and local governments total revenue from dod customers increased percent  or million  to billion for fy as compared to fy substantially all of the dod revenue growth was attributable to existing operations 
dod revenue includes that earned for services provided to the us army  our largest customer  where our services focus on supporting readiness  tactical military intelligence  and communications of the combat operations in iraq and afghanistan 
dod revenue also includes work with the us navy  such as services to support the navy s automatic identification technologies and a mine countermeasure program that protects its fleet 
revenue from dod customers increased percent  or million  to billion for fy as compared to fy acquisitions accounted for percent of this growth  contributing million 
revenue from federal civilian agencies decreased million  or percent  to million during fy as compared to fy this decrease is primarily attributable to revenue earned on projects that were substantially completed prior to june  and the timing of the fees on certain contracts where we recognize a portion of the fees upon customer approvals 
approximately percent of federal civilian agency revenue for the year was derived from the department of justice doj  for whom we provide litigation support services 
revenue from doj was million in fy versus million in fy federal civilian agency revenue also includes services provided to non dod national intelligence agencies 
during fy as compared to fy  revenue from federal civilian agencies increased million  or percent  to million 
this revenue growth came both organically and from acquisitions 
acquisitions accounted for percent of the increase 
approximately percent of federal civilian agency revenue for the year was derived from doj 
revenue from doj was million in fy versus million in fy 
table of contents commercial and other revenue increased percent  or million  to million in fy as compared to fy this revenue growth came both organically and from acquisitions 
acquisitions accounted for million or percent of the increase 
commercial revenue is derived from both international and domestic operations 
in fy  international operations accounted for percent  or million  of the total commercial revenue  while domestic operations accounted for percent  or million 
commercial revenue decreased percent  or million  to million in fy as compared to fy in fy  international operations accounted for percent  or million  of the total commercial revenue  while domestic operations accounted for percent  or million 
the decrease in commercial revenue was primarily from our uk operations  which decreased by percent  or million  as a result of unfavorable exchange rates 
revenue from state and local governments decreased by percent  or million during fy  as compared to fy in fy as compared to fy  revenue from state and local governments increased by percent  or million 
revenue from state and local governments represented less than one percent of our total revenue in each of fy  fy  and fy our continued focus on dod and federal civilian agency opportunities has resulted in a relatively reduced emphasis on state and local government business 
income from operations operating income increased percent  or million  in fy as compared to fy our operating margin in fy of percent decreased from percent in each of fy and fy in fy as compared to fy  operating income increased percent  or million 
the decrease in margin rate related primarily to an increase in subcontract labor and materials as a percent of total direct costs  a decline in the margins of our direct labor and higher variable cash and stock compensation expense 
during the fiscal years ended june    and  as a percentage of revenue  total direct costs were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the year to year increases in direct costs as a percentage of revenue were driven primarily by an increase in other direct costs odcs  specifically the use of subcontractors 
these costs are common in our industry  are typically incurred in response to specific client tasks  and may vary from period to period 
the single largest component of direct costs  direct labor  was million  million and million in fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the increase in direct labor during the last three fiscal years is attributable to the organic growth in our federal government business  both in the dod and federal civilian agencies  and to acquisitions 
odcs  which include  among other costs  subcontractor labor and materials along with equipment purchases and travel expenses  were billion  billion  and million in fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the year over year increases were primarily the result of increased volume of tasking across all of our major service offerings including the aforementioned acquisitions 
indirect costs and selling expenses include fringe benefits attributable to both direct and indirect labor  marketing and bid and proposal costs  indirect labor and other discretionary costs 
as a percentage of revenue  indirect costs and selling expenses were percent  percent and percent for fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the decrease in percentage experienced during these fiscal years is primarily the result of integrating acquired businesses while controlling our various indirect and general and administrative expenses in these periods of growth 
indirect expense in fy also reflected the benefit of higher forfeitures available to offset company contributions under our k plan 
this higher level of forfeitures resulted from an amendment to the k plan that provided that non vested balances are forfeited upon the earlier of a distribution being taken or december of the year the participant terminates employment 
previously  non vested balances were forfeited upon the earlier of a distribution being taken or december following a five year break in service 
indirect costs and selling expenses in fy were impacted by a reduction in expense associated with a gain on a commercial legal matter 

table of contents a component of indirect costs and selling expenses is stock compensation 
total stock compensation expense was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
the decrease in stock compensation expense from fy to fy was due primarily to a higher level of forfeitures in fy the increase in stock compensation expense from fy to fy was due to the issuance of performance based rsus which require recording of associated stock compensation expense on an accelerated basis and the determination during fy that  based on our performance during fy  the maximum number of rsus associated with grants made during fy and fy would be earned 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or percent  in fy as compared to fy the increase was primarily attributable to amortization of acquired intangibles offset by a decrease in software amortization on externally marketed software 
in fy as compared to fy  depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or percent  primarily from a decrease in software amortization on externally marketed software 
net interest expense and other decreased million  or percent in fy  as compared to fy primarily as a result of lower interest rates  lower days sales outstanding  and the july million prepayment on our term loan 
net interest expense and other decreased million  or percent  in fy as compared to fy primarily as a result of lower interest rates 
the effective income tax rates in fy  fy  and fy  were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the lower tax rate in fy as compared to fy related primarily to the tax benefits related to deductions claimed for income from qualified domestic production activities and to non taxable gains on assets invested in corporate owned life insurance policies in fy as compared to non deductible losses on those assets in fy quarterly financial information quarterly financial data for the two most recent fiscal years is provided in note  quarterly financial data  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
effects of inflation during fy  percent of our business was conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which automatically adjust revenue to cover costs that are affected by inflation 
percent of our revenue was earned under t m contracts  where labor rates for many of the services provided are often fixed for several years 
under certain t m contracts containing indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity procurement arrangements  we do adjust labor rates annually as permitted 
the remaining portion of our business is fixed price and may span multiple years 
we generally have been able to price our t m and fixed price contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our positive cash flow from operations and our available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fund our operational needs 
cash flows from operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the credit facility is a million credit facility  which includes a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility  and a million term loan the term loan 
at june   million was outstanding under the term loan  nothing was outstanding under the revolving facility and we had no letters of credit outstanding 
on august   we made an million prepayment on the term loan  reducing the outstanding balance to million 
from time to time  we may make additional prepayments  based on cash flows  working capital requirements and other capital needs 

table of contents the term loan portion of the credit facility is a seven year secured facility under which principal payments are due in quarterly installments of million at the end of each fiscal quarter through march and the balance is due in full on may  prior to the expiration of the credit facility  we intend to establish a new  multi year term loan and revolving credit agreement 
interest rates for both revolving facility and term loan borrowings are based on the london inter bank offered rate libor  or the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate in each case  plus applicable margins 
margins and unused facility fee rates are determined quarterly based on our leverage ratios 
we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the credit facility that limit our leverage  require us to maintain a minimum net worth and require us to meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these financial covenants apply throughout the term of the credit facility 
the credit agreement dated as of may   as amended  governing our credit facility provides the remedies available to the lenders in the event of an uncured violation of any of the financial covenants 
such remedies may include the termination of the credit facility and the demand for payment of all outstanding amounts due thereunder 
since the inception of the credit facility  we have always been in compliance with all of the financial covenants and expect to remain in compliance through the may expiration of the credit facility 
the total costs associated with securing the credit facility  as amended  were million and are being amortized over the life of the credit facility 
effective may   we issued the notes  which mature on may   in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act of the notes are subordinate to our senior secured debt  and interest on the notes is payable on may and november of each year 
holders may convert their notes at a conversion rate of shares of caci common stock for each  of note principal an initial conversion price of per share under the following circumstances if the last reported sale price of caci stock is greater than or equal to percent of the conversion price for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five consecutive business day period immediately after any ten consecutive trading day period the note measurement period in which the average of the trading price per  principal amount of convertible note was equal to or less than percent of the average product of the closing price of a share of our common stock and the conversion rate of each date during the note measurement period  upon the occurrence of certain corporate events  as defined  or during the last three month period prior to maturity 
we are required to satisfy percent of the principal amount of these notes solely in cash  with any amounts above the principal amount to be satisfied in common stock 
as of june   none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied 
in the event of a fundamental change  as defined  holders may require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to the principal amount plus any accrued interest 
also  if certain fundamental changes occur prior to maturity  we will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock or  in lieu thereof  we may in certain circumstances elect to adjust the conversion rate and related conversion obligation so that these notes are convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company 
we are not permitted to redeem the notes 
the contingently issuable shares are not included in our diluted share count for the fiscal year ended june  or  because our average stock price during those periods was below the conversion price 
of total debt issuance costs of million  million is being amortized to interest expense over seven years 
the remaining million of debt issuance costs are included in shareholders equity 
upon closing of the sale of the notes  million of the net proceeds was used to concurrently repurchase one million shares of our common stock 

table of contents in connection with the issuance of the notes  we purchased in a private transaction at a cost of million call options the call options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at a price equal to the conversion price of per share 
the call options allow us to receive shares of our common stock from the counterparties equal to the amount of common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would pay the holders of the notes upon conversion 
in addition  we sold warrants the warrants to issue approximately million shares of caci common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the proceeds from the sale of the warrants totaled million 
for income tax reporting purposes  the notes and the call options are integrated 
this creates an original issue discount for income tax reporting purposes  and therefore the cost of the call options is being accounted for as interest expense over the term of the notes for income tax reporting purposes 
the associated income tax benefit of million to be realized for income tax reporting purposes over the term of the notes was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital and a long term deferred tax asset 
the majority of this deferred tax asset is offset in our balance sheet by the million deferred tax liability that was recognized with the adoption of the updates to asc  debt with conversion and other options asc that were retroactively applied to may  see below for additional information on the impact of adopting the updates to asc 
on a combined basis  the call options and the warrants are intended to reduce the potential dilution of caci s common stock in the event that the notes are converted by effectively increasing the conversion price of these notes from to 
the call options are anti dilutive and are therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted shares outstanding 
the warrants will result in additional diluted shares outstanding if our average common stock price exceeds 
the call options and the warrants are separate and legally distinct instruments that bind us and the counterparties and have no binding effect on the holders of the notes 
beginning july   we have accounted for the notes in accordance with the updates to asc these rules were applied retrospectively and  accordingly  balances effected by asc as of and for the years ended june   and have been adjusted to reflect the impacts of the update 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for additional information 
in accordance with asc  the company accounts for the liability and the equity conversion option components of the notes  and recognizes expense on the notes  using an interest rate in effect for comparable debt instruments that do not contain conversion features 
the effective interest rate for the notes excluding its conversion option was determined to be percent 
the fair value of the liability component of the notes was calculated to be million at may   the date of issuance 
the excess of the million of gross proceeds over the million fair value of the liability component  or million  represents the fair value of the equity component  which has been recorded  net of income tax effect  as additional paid in capital within shareholders equity 
this million difference represents a debt discount that is amortized over the seven year term of the notes as a non cash component of interest expense 
while the new rules cause reported interest expense to increase  and correspondingly cause basic and diluted earnings per share to decrease  they have no effect on net cash flows 
we also maintain two lines of credit in addition to the revolving facility  one in the uk  and one under a joint venture 
the total amount available under the line of credit facility in the uk  which is cancelable at any time upon notice from the bank  is million pounds sterling 
the amount available under the joint venture s line of credit is million  and is scheduled to expire in september as of june   the company had no outstanding borrowings under either of these lines of credit 
in june  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to million shares of our common stock where the total expenditure for the purchase of the shares under this repurchase program does not exceed million 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to cash flow generated from operations 
working capital was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
this decrease in working capital is the result of our term loan becoming due within the next twelve months 
our operating cash flow was million for fy  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
the current year increase in operating cash flow results from profits earned during the current year and our strong operational processes 
days sales outstanding improved to at june   compared to for the same period a year ago 
we used million and million of cash in investing activities during fy and fy  respectively 
the increase in fy was attributed primarily to the acquisitions completed during the year 
in addition to the cash we paid at the date of each acquisition completed during fy  we may be required to pay additional consideration contingent consideration of up to a total of approximately million in the event that the acquired businesses achieve certain specified earnings results during the two year periods subsequent to each acquisition 
we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration as of each acquisition date using a valuation model which included the evaluation of all possible outcomes and the application of an appropriate discount rate 
at the end of each reporting period  the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured and any changes are recorded in indirect costs and selling expenses 
during the year ended june   this remeasurement resulted in a million reduction in the liability recorded 
as of june   the fair value of the expected contingent consideration to be paid was million 
purchases of office and computer related equipment of million and million in fy and fy  respectively  accounted for a majority of the remaining funds used in investing activities 
the increase in capital expenditures in fy was primarily the result of capital expenditures incurred in connection with our consolidation of office space in a new building in northern virginia 
generally  we have relatively low capital expenditure requirements for our business  and expect these expenditures in the coming years to remain consistent with the levels reported in fiscal years prior to fy cash flows used in financing activities were million during fy and million during fy during fy  we prepaid million of our term loan 
during fy  we used million of cash to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in june cash flows from financing activities continued to benefit from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under our espp 
proceeds from these activities totaled million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
these were offset by cash used to purchase stock to fulfill obligations under the espp 
cash used to acquire stock under the espp was million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
we believe that we will be able to refinance our credit facility prior to its may expiration on terms that will be acceptable to us 
that  together with the combination of internally generated funds  available bank borrowings  and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on going operations  customary capital expenditures  debt service obligations  and other working capital requirements over the next twelve months 
over the longer term  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations necessary to fulfill the obligations under our anticipated new credit facility and the notes will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by many factors outside of our control  including current worldwide economic conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we use off balance sheet arrangements to finance the lease of operating facilities 
we have financed the use of all of our current office and warehouse facilities through operating leases 
operating leases are also used to finance the use of computers  servers  phone systems  and to a lesser extent  other fixed assets  such as furnishings  that are obtained in connection with business acquisitions 
we generally assume the lease rights and 
table of contents obligations of companies acquired in business combinations and continue financing equipment under operating leases until the end of the lease term following the acquisition date 
we generally do not finance capital expenditures with operating leases  but instead finance such purchases with available cash balances 
for additional information regarding our operating lease commitments  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
the credit facility provides for stand by letters of credit aggregating up to million that reduce the funds available under the revolving facility when issued 
as of june   we had no outstanding letters of credit 
we have no other material off balance sheet financing arrangements

see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters and note for information on an million prepayment made subsequent to june  see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding operating lease commitments 
this liability is substantially offset by investments held by the plan provider to be reimbursed to us upon the payment of the liability to the plan participant 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the interest rates on both the term loan and the revolving facility are affected by changes in market interest rates 
we have the ability to manage these fluctuations in part through interest rate hedging alternatives in the form of interest rate swaps and caps 
we have maintained hedging relationships with various counterparties in recent years  including two interest rate swap agreements that expired in december these agreements allowed us to exchange a portion of our variable rate debt for fixed rate debt 
we have not entered into new interest rate swaps at this time due to the relatively favorable interest rate environment and as our variable rate debt matures in may accordingly  effective in mid december  all outstanding balances under our term loan  and any amounts that may be borrowed under our revolving facility  are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
without interest rate swap agreements  our interest expense on our variable rate debt would have fluctuated by approximately million for the year ended june  with every one percent fluctuation in the applicable interest rates 
approximately percent and percent of our total revenue in fy and fy  respectively  was derived from our international operations in the uk our practice in the uk is to negotiate contracts in the 
table of contents same currency in which the predominant expenses are incurred  thereby mitigating the exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
it is not possible to accomplish this in all cases  thus  there is some risk that profits will be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
as of june  we held a combination of euros and pounds sterling in the uk equivalent to approximately million 
this allows us to better utilize our cash resources on behalf of our foreign subsidiaries  thereby mitigating foreign currency conversion risks
