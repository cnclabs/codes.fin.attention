this md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements the notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
strategic overview canterbury park holding corporation was incorporated under the laws of minnesota and acquired land and buildings to conduct pari mutuel horse racing operations in march the racetrack is located in shakopee  minnesota  approximately miles southwest of downtown minneapolis 
in may  we commenced year round pari mutuel simulcast wagering operations and during the summer of  we hosted the first annual live race meet 
our live racing operations are a seasonal business as we host live race meets each year from may until late summer 
we earn additional pari mutuel revenue by televising our live racing to out of state racetracks around the country 
we also derive revenues from related services and activities  such as advertising  admissions  parking and publication sales and from other entertainment events and activities held at the racetrack 
in april  we opened canterbury park s card room 
the card room operates hours a day  seven days a week and is limited by minnesota state law to a maximum of tables 
the card room currently offers a mix of both poker and table games up to this state maximum table limit 
our three largest sources of revenues  card room operations  pari mutuel operations and concessions sales  generate cash revenues 
consequently  the company is highly liquid and has not utilized its line of credit in over six years 
financial performance summary net revenues operating expenses income before income tax expense income tax expense net income the primary strengths of canterbury park are our dedicated and capable staff  our first class facilities and acre property and the legal authority to offer our unique gaming products in our market area 
our management team has extensive knowledge of the horse racing and card businesses and our staff has demonstrated a commitment to our customers 
we continue to implement improvements to our comprehensive customer satisfaction measurement and enhancement program 
our management team has a good relationship with our workforce and is able to retain qualified personnel as demonstrated by our low turnover rate 
our facilities are modern by racetrack industry standards  and we have invested heavily in the past few years to update and upgrade them to meet the needs of our customers and horsemen 
our acre property with a prime location on the edge of the minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan area in one of the fastest growing counties in minnesota provides us with great long term growth and development opportunities 
our board of 
table of contents directors is engaged in an evaluation of the highest and best potential uses of our underutilized land 
our long term strategic direction is to enhance the character of our property as a unique gaming and entertainment destination 
we have a strong commitment to live racing and have been particularly successful in attracting new customers and providing a quality live racing experience for our horse racing fans as well as the horsemen who enter their horses in live races at canterbury park 
the success of the card room has greatly enhanced our ability to offer a more competitive purse structure for live racing and has allowed us to make significant improvements to our grandstand and the backside stabling and training facilities 
as a result  we have been near capacity for horses stabled at canterbury park during our recent live race meets 
we continue to believe that our best option for long term growth is to gain authority under minnesota law to offer additional gaming options  which would enhance horse racing with increased purses  provide growth and development opportunities and produce significant new tax revenues for state and local governments 
the effort to obtain legislative authority for these initiatives has required  and will continue to require  substantial expenditures 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcome of legislative activities  there can be no assurance that any bills favorable to the company s interests will be enacted into law  and it is possible  as a result of the legislative process  that legislation directly or indirectly adverse to the company may be enacted into law 
current developments in january  the company began an extensive remodeling project in our card room 
as a result  the card room was moved to a temporary location on the mezzanine level on january  the company plans to reopen the card room in its original location in april the remodeling project is being conducted to redesign and enhance virtually every aspect of the room  including the d cor  entrance  location of the bathrooms  and even the chairs 
we believe our customers will find that the remodel will greatly enhance their gaming experience  which will result in increased revenues 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets at december  we utilize our judgment in various ways including determining whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset  determining the estimated useful lives of assets  and determining if or when an asset has been impaired 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of these assets with their related expected future net cash flows 
should the sum of the related expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  we will determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
an impairment loss would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
to date  we have determined that no impairment of these assets exists

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued accounting standards codification asc  generally accepted accounting principles asc 
asc establishes the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernment entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities law are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
references to fasb guidance throughout this document have been updated for the codification 
the company adopted an update to asc business combinations asc on january  asc establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this update had no material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company adopted an update to asc fair value measurement and disclosures asc january  for non financial assets 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurement 
asc also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
under asc  fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy 
the company adopted asc for the fiscal year beginning january  for financial assets 
the adoption of asc and the update had no material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company adopted an update to asc subsequent events asc on april  asc provides guidance on when a subsequent event should be recognized in the financial statements 
subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet should be recognized at the balance sheet date 
subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that arose after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued  or are available to be issued  are not required to be recognized 
the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated must be disclosed as well as whether it is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued 
for non recognized subsequent events which should be disclosed to keep the financial statements from being misleading  the nature of the event and an estimate of its financial effect  or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made  should be disclosed

at this time  we believe that the likelihood that these two conditions will be met and that we will be required to pay these amounts is remote 
at the date if any that these two conditions are met  the five minimum payments will be discounted back to their present value and the sum of those discounted payments will be capitalized as part of the purchase price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the purchase price will be
