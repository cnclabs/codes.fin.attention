introduction argan  inc the company  we  us  or our conducts operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries  gemma power systems  llc and affiliates gps that we acquired in december  vitarich laboratories  inc vli that we acquired in august  and southern maryland cable  inc smc that we acquired in july through gps  we provide a full range of development  consulting  engineering  procurement  construction  commissioning  operations and maintenance services to the power generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including public utilities  independent power project owners  municipalities  public institutions and private industry 
through vli  we develop  manufacture and distribute premium nutritional products 
through smc  we provide telecommunications infrastructure services including project management  construction and maintenance to the federal government  telecommunications and broadband service providers as well as electric utilities 
each of the wholly owned subsidiaries represents a separate reportable segment power industry services  nutritional products and telecommunications infrastructure services  respectively 
overview and outlook for the fiscal year ended january   consolidated net revenues were million which represented an increase of million  or  over net revenues of million for the prior year 
net income for the fiscal year ended january  was million  or per diluted share 
we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in net revenues between years was due primarily to increases in the net revenues of the power industry services and nutritional products businesses  which represented and of consolidated net revenues for the current fiscal year  respectively 
primarily due to the completion of a substantial portion of the contract to construct a power generation facility in california  the contract backlog of gps decreased to million at january  from million at january  income from operations decreased by million in the fiscal year ended january  to million from million in the year ended january  reflecting a million decline in the gross profit of the power industry services business partially offset by improvements in the gross profit of the nutritional products and telecommunications infrastructure services businesses which totaled approximately million 
income from operations for the current year results also benefited from a million decrease between years in impairment losses 
income before income taxes decreased by million in the current year to million from million last year due primarily to the million decrease in income from operations discussed above and a million reduction in income earned from the investment of cash balances 
late in the current year  we acquired the remaining ownership interest in gemma renewable power  llc grp and grp became our wholly owned subsidiary 
during the current year  we benefited from a  increase in the amount of our equity in the earnings of grp and a gain on the bargain purchase of the net assets of grp in the amount of  
table of contents cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during the current year to million at january  despite reporting net income of million for the year ended january   our operating activities used million cash 
we also used cash to reduce our long term debt by million to a balance of million 
this long term debt amount represented only and of total stockholders equity and consolidated total assets as of january   respectively 
our business is not capital equipment intensive 
although our businesses made capital expenditures totaling  in the current year  the balance of net fixed assets represented only of consolidated total assets at january  the acquisition of grp provided net cash of approximately million for the current year 
we also received total cash proceeds of  during the year ended january  from the sale of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options and warrants 
including the performance of work on projects included in the contract backlog of gps at january  and expected to be awarded during the year ending january   we expect to continue the growth of the company s consolidated net revenues in the next fiscal year and to report operating results that are profitable and that include net cash provided by operations 
however  current economic conditions in the us  which reflect a weak recovery from last year s recession and continued disruptions in the credit markets  could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods  particularly if the depressed state of the construction industry is prolonged or if the continuing government efforts to stabilize financial institutions  to restore order to credit markets  to stimulate spending and to reduce high unemployment are not effective 
the current instability in the financial markets may make it difficult for certain of our customers  particularly for projects funded by private investment  to access the credit markets to obtain financing for new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  we may encounter increased levels of deferrals and delays related to new construction projects in the future 
difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets may significantly increase the rate at which our customers defer  delay or cancel proposed new construction projects 
the deferral  delay or cancellation of existing or proposed projects could result in a decrease in the overall demand for our services  adversely impacting our results of operations and weakening our financial condition 
we anticipate that the increased political focus on energy independence and the negative environmental impact of fossil fuels may spur the development of alternative and renewable power facilities which should result in new power facility opportunities for us in the future 
more than half of the states have adopted formal green energy goals and federal support for infrastructure spending remains strong 
an energy infrastructure renewal program was included in the us government economic stimulus package  making funds available for water and energy projects and including tax incentives to encourage capital investment in renewable energy sources 
moreover  we continue to observe renewed interest in gas fired generation as electric utilities and independent power producers look to diversify their generation options 
we believe that the initiatives in many states to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  and utilities desire to fill demand for additional power prior to the completion of more sizeable or controversial projects  will stimulate renewed demand for gas fired power plants 
as described above  both the colusa and sentinel power projects are gas fired electricity generation plants 
while it is unclear what the impact of current economic conditions might have on the timing or financing of such future projects  we expect that gas fired power plants will continue to be an important component of long term power generation development in the us and believe our capabilities and expertise will position us as a market leader for these projects 
in summary  it is uncertain what impacts the general economic conditions and the aftereffects of the financial credit crisis in the us may have on our business 
we are continuously alert for effects that may be impacting our business currently and any new developments that may affect us going forward 
moreover  the uncertain economic conditions may impair our visibility to an unusual degree 
nevertheless  we remain cautiously optimistic about our long term growth opportunities 
we are focused on expanding our position in the growing power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of increasing electricity demand covering decades into the future 
we believe that our expectations are reasonable and that our future plans are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  such forward looking statements  by their nature  involve risks and uncertainties  and they should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors included in item a of this annual report on form k

the ability to quickly replace lost customers or to increase the product offerings sold to existing customers is hampered by the long sales cycle inherent in our type of business

when sufficient information about claims on guaranteed projects would be available and monetary damages or other costs or losses would be determined to be probable  we would record such guarantee losses 

table of contents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization non gaap measurement we believe that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a meaningful presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure  the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects of operating in different income tax jurisdictions 
further  we believe that ebitda is widely used by investors and analysts as a measure of performance 
as ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  we do not believe that this measure should be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  the results of our operations presented in accordance with us gaap that are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our ebitda does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
the following table presents the determinations of ebitda for the years ended january   and ebitda years ended january  net income loss  as reported interest expense income tax expense amortization of purchased intangible assets depreciation and other amortization ebitda as we believe that our net cash flow from operations is the most directly comparable performance measure determined in accordance with us gaap  the following table reconciles the amounts of ebitda for the applicable years  as presented above  to the corresponding amounts of net cash flows used in provided by operating activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
reconciliations of ebitda years ended january  ebitda current income tax expense interest expense impairment losses non cash stock option compensation expense provision for inventory obsolescence equity in the earnings of an unconsolidated subsidiary gain from bargain purchase decrease in escrowed cash decrease increase in accounts receivable change related to the timing of scheduled billings decrease increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities other  net net cash used in provided by operations inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivables  and our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture  and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our costs and expenses  such as those for employee compensation and benefits and commodities used in construction projects  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition on long term construction contracts  the valuation of goodwill and long lived assets  income tax reporting and the reporting of legal matters to be most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in making estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we recognize a significant portion of revenues in connection with performance under long term construction contracts in accordance with current authoritative guidance 
the types of contracts may vary and include agreements under which revenues are based on a fixed price basis or cost plus fee 
revenues from cost plus fee construction agreements are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned  measured using the cost to cost method 
revenues from fixed price construction agreements  including portions of estimated profit  are recognized as services are provided  based on costs incurred and estimated total contract costs using the percentage of completion method 
therefore  changes to the total estimated contract cost of a fixed price contract may affect the amount of profit or the extent of loss 
the effect of the change on profit or loss is recorded in the period when the change in estimated total contract cost is determined 
we review the estimates of total cost on each significant contract monthly 
in connection with the acquisitions of gps  vli and smc  we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer relationships  proprietary formulas  non compete agreements and trade names 
other than goodwill  most of our purchased intangible assets are determined to have finite useful lives 
at february   the beginning of our most recent fiscal year  goodwill and other purchased intangible assets together represented approximately of consolidated total assets 
we review goodwill for impairment at least annually 
goodwill and the other purchased intangible assets are assessed more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset value might be impaired 
we utilize the assistance of professional appraisal firms in the initial determination of the fair value of these intangible assets using various techniques 
certain techniques require us to make estimates and assumptions about the future financial performance of the acquired businesses that may change in the future 
the declining sales and the operating losses experienced by vli during the years ended january  and indicated that the carrying values of vli s goodwill and long lived assets were impaired 
we performed assessments of the carrying values and determined that the net unadjusted carrying values of these assets exceeded the current fair values 
accordingly  we recorded asset impairment losses related to vli in the total amounts of million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
as of january  and  our consolidated balance sheets included net deferred tax assets in the total amounts of million and million  respectively  resulting from our future deductible temporary differences 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our ability to realize our deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if such estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
at this time  based substantially on the strong earnings performance of our power industry services business segment  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in several legal matters where litigation has been initiated or claims have been made against us 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in each case 
at this time  management does not believe that a material loss is probable related to either one of the current matters discussed therein 
however  we do maintain accrued expense balances for the estimated amounts of legal costs expected to be billed related to each matter 
should our assessments of the outcomes of these legal matters change  significant losses or additional costs may be recorded 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence 
a description of the company s significant accounting policies  including those discussed above  is included in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents adopted and other recently issued accounting pronouncements included in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k are discussions of accounting pronouncements adopted by us during the year ended january  that we consider relevant to our consolidated financial statements and recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our financing arrangement with bank of america the bank  including a term loan with a total outstanding amount of approximately million at january   that bears interest at a floating rate 
we had a floating for fixed interest rate swap agreement covering a portion of the term loan amount and hedging against changes in the floating interest rate that expired on december  as such  we are now exposed to increasing or decreasing market interest rates related to the term loan 
based on the scheduled outstanding indebtedness of our term loan  if market rates used to calculate interest expense were to average higher in the next twelve months  our interest expense would increase by an amount not material to our consolidated results of operations 
this analysis takes into account the current outstanding balance of our term loan with the bank  assumed interest rates  and the current term loan payment schedule 
the result of this analysis would change if the underlying assumptions were modified
