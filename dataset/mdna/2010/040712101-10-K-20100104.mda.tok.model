item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting period our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest september we report fiscal years under a week format 
this reporting method is used by many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year to year comparisons of operating results 
under this method  certain years will contain weeks 
the fiscal year ended september  included weeks and the fiscal year ended october  included weeks 
revenues total revenues decreased by from fiscal to fiscal same store sales decreased  or  on a company wide basis from fiscal to fiscal same store sales in las vegas decreased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal same store sales in las vegas were negatively affected by the unwillingness of the public to engage in gaming activities and a decrease in tourism and convention business  all related to the current economic conditions 
same store sales in new york decreased  or  during fiscal same store sales in new york were particularly negatively affected by unusually inclement weather with large amounts of rain  continuing layoffs and lack of new job creation  especially in the financial sector  a decrease in corporate parties and a decrease in tourism and convention business related to the current economic conditions 
same store sales in washington dc decreased by  or  during fiscal although the current economic conditions do not seem to have affected the washington dc region as much as other regions  unusually inclement weather with large amounts of rain  continuing layoffs and lack of new job creation  a decrease in corporate parties and a decrease in tourism and convention business related to the current economic conditions all contributed to a decrease in sales 
same store sales in atlantic city decreased by  or in fiscal compared to fiscal same store sales in atlantic city were negatively affected by the unwillingness of the public to engage in gaming activities and a decrease in tourism and convention business related to the current economic conditions as well as the introduction of slot machine parlors in nearby pennsylvania

same store sales in connecticut decreased  or  during fiscal same store sales in connecticut were negatively affected by the unwillingness of the public to engage in gaming activities related to the current economic conditions 
other operating income  which consists of the sale of merchandise at various restaurants  management fee income and door sales was  in fiscal and  in fiscal this decrease was mostly attributable to the decrease in sales 
costs and expenses food and beverage cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal and in fiscal total costs and expenses decreased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in sales 
payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal payroll expense was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  a decrease in sales resulted in an increase in payroll expenses 
we continually evaluate our payroll expenses as they relate to sales 
the opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel  excess kitchen costs  costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre opening period and during a post opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally 
the amount of such pre opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened 
in fiscal  we began operating a mexican restaurant and lounge  yolos  at the rethemed planet hollywood casino in las vegas  nevada  and entered into an agreement to lease space for the restaurant  robert  at the museum of arts design at columbus circle in manhattan 
robert opened on december  we are the majority owner and managing member of the limited liability company which operates this restaurant 
we incurred  in pre opening expenses in fiscal  which is the cumulative total pre opening expenses for robert for the fiscal year 
our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  were in fiscal and in fiscal we manage two consolidated facilities we do not own el rio grande and the food market at the mgm grand  and the tampa and hollywood florida food court operations  and in fiscal  lucky seven at foxwoods 
sales of el rio grande were  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
sales of the the food market at the mgm grand were  during fiscal and  during the portion of fiscal in which it was open 
sales of the tampa and hollywood florida food court operations were  during fiscal and  during fiscal sales of lucky seven were  during fiscal interest expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal interest income was  in fiscal and  in fiscal investments are made in government securities and investment quality corporate instruments 
other income  which generally consists of purchasing service fees  equity in losses of affiliates and other income at various restaurants  was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes calculated by each new york subsidiary on a non consolidated basis 
most of the restaurants we own or manage are owned or managed by a separate subsidiary 
for state and local income tax purposes  the losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary s income  with the exception of the restaurants operating in the district of columbia 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of losses incurred at individual subsidiaries 
our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the level of losses incurred at our new york facilities  which cannot be consolidated for state and local tax purposes  pre tax income earned outside of new york city and the utilization of state and local net operating loss carry forwards 
nevada has no state income tax and other states in which we operate have income tax rates substantially lower in comparison to new york 
in order to utilize more effectively tax loss carry forwards at restaurants that were unprofitable  we have merged certain profitable subsidiaries with certain loss subsidiaries 
the revenue reconciliation act of provides tax credits to us for fica taxes paid on tip income of restaurant service personnel 
the net benefit to us was  in fiscal and  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations 
we have  from time to time  also utilized equipment financing in connection with the construction of a restaurant and seller financing in connection with the acquisition of a restaurant 
we utilize capital primarily to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants  acquiring existing restaurants owned by others and remodeling existing restaurants we own 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  cash was used for the replacement of fixed assets at existing restaurants and the construction of robert at the museum of arts design at columbus circle in manhattan 
cash was also used to purchase investment securities 
cash provided by investing activities was generated from the sale of investment securities 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  cash was used for the replacement of fixed assets at existing restaurants and the construction of yolos  a mexican restaurant  at the planet hollywood resort and casino formerly known as the aladdin resort and casino in las vegas  nevada 
cash was also used to purchase investment securities 
cash provided by investing activities was generated from the sale of discontinued operations and the sale of investment securities 
the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal of  and  in fiscal was principally used for the payment of dividends 
we had a working capital surplus of  at october  as compared to a working capital surplus of  at september  a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share was declared on october  and january  april  july and october  on september   our board of directors declared a special cash dividend in the amount of per share 
on december   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share 
we intend to continue to pay such quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future  however  the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is based on future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements  changes in us taxation and other relevant factors 
restaurant expansion during the fiscal year ended october   we began construction of the restaurant robert at the museum of arts design at columbus circle in manhattan 
this restaurant opened on december  we are the majority owner and managing member of the limited liability company which operates this restaurant 
the opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel  excess kitchen costs  costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre opening period and during a post opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally 
the amount of such pre opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened 
we incurred  in pre opening expenses in fiscal  which is the cumulative total pre opening expenses of this restaurant for the fiscal year 
our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
we are not currently committed to any projects 
we may take advantage of opportunities we consider to be favorable  when they occur  depending upon the availability of financing and other factors 
recent restaurant dispositions and charges during the first fiscal quarter of  we discontinued the operation of our columbus bakery retail and wholesale bakery located in new york city 
columbus bakery was originally intended to serve as the bakery that would provide all of our new york restaurants with baked goods as well as being a retail bakery operation 
as a result of the sale and closure of several of our restaurants in new york city during the last several years  this bakery operation was no longer profitable 
during the second fiscal quarter of we opened  along with certain third party investors  a new concept at this location called pinch s mac which features pizza and macaroni and cheese 
we contributed columbus bakery s net fixed assets and cash into this venture and received an ownership interest of 
these operations are not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
effective june   the lease for our stage deli facility at the forum shops in las vegas  nevada expired 
the landlord for this facility offered to renew the lease at this location prior to its expiration at a significantly increased rent 
the company determined that it would not be able to operate this facility profitably at this location at the rent offered in the landlord s renewal proposal 
as a result  the company discontinued these operations during the third fiscal quarter of and took a charge for the impairment of goodwill of  and a loss on disposal of  the impairment charge and disposal loss are included in discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report 
below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical fasb accounting standards codification the issuance of fasb accounting standards codification tm the codification on july  effective for interim or annual reporting periods ending after september   changes the way that us generally accepted accounting principles gaap are referenced 
beginning on that date  the codification officially became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental gaap  however  sec registrants must also consider rules  regulations  and interpretive guidance issued by the sec or its staff 
the change affects the way we refer to gaap in our financial statements and accounting policies 
all existing standards that were used to create the codification became superseded 
instead  references to standards consist solely of the number used in the codification s structural organization 
for example  it is no longer proper to refer to fasb statement no 
 fair value measurement  which is now codification topic fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
consistent with the effective date of the codification  financial statements for periods ending after september   refers to the codification structure  not pre codification historical gaap 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the accounting estimates that require our most difficult and subjective judgments include allowances for potential bad debts on receivables  inventories  the useful lives and recoverability of our assets  such as property and intangibles  fair values of financial instruments and share based compensation  the realizable value of our tax assets and other matters 
because of the uncertainty in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
long lived assets in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment asc  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including estimated future sales growth and estimated profit margins are included in this analysis 
we believe at this time that carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
for the years ended october  and september   no impairment charges were deemed necessary 
leases we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including option periods as described below 
within the provisions of certain leases there are escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the option 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is expensed as incurred 
certain leases include both base rent and percentage rent 
we record rent expense on these leases based upon reasonably assured sales levels 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease terms for amortizing leasehold improvements as were used in calculating straight line rent expense for each restaurant 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different lease terms were used 
deferred income tax valuation allowance we provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized 
certain items  such as state and local tax loss carry forwards  are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies 
future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
goodwill and trademarks goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
trademarks  which were acquired in connection with the durgin park acquisition  are considered to have an indefinite life and are not being amortized 
we apply the provisions of asc topic intangibles goodwill and other asc which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit we are being treated as one reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of the reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we perform internal valuation analyses and considers other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows  market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  a discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
based on the above policy  no impairment charges were necessary in fiscal and approximately  of goodwill impairment expense was recorded during fiscal year in connection with restaurant dispositions 
share based compensation effective october   we adopted asc topic compensation stock compensation asc and began expensing the grant date fair value of employee stock options using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  non cash compensation expense is recognized under the fair value method for the portion of outstanding equity based awards granted prior to the adoption of asc for which service has not been rendered  and for any equity based awards granted or modified after adoption 
accordingly  periods prior to adoption have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of asc  we accounted for equity based compensation using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  prior to october   no compensation expense had been recognized for employee stock options  as options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
upon adoption of asc  we elected to value employee stock options using the black scholes option valuation method that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividend yield of our stock  the expected life of the options and the risk free interest rate 
we use the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation 
the alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the effects of employee share based compensation  which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of asc during fiscal  options to purchase  shares of common stock were granted at an exercise price of per share and are exercisable as to of the shares commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant and as to an additional commencing on the second anniversary of the date of grant 
such options had an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately  we did not grant any options during the fiscal year we generally issue new shares upon the exercise of employee stock options 
the fair value of each of our stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividend yield of our stock  the expected life of the options and the risk free interest rate 
the assumptions used for the grant include a risk free interest rate of  volatility of  a dividend yield of and an expected life of years
