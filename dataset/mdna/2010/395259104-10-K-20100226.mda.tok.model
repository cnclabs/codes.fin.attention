item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview greenhill is an independent investment banking firm that i provides financial advice on significant mergers  acquisitions  financings  restructurings and similar corporate finance matters as well as fund placement services for private equity and other financial sponsors and ii manages and invests in merchant banking funds and makes other principal investments 
we act for clients located throughout the world from offices in new york  london  frankfurt  tokyo  toronto  chicago  dallas  houston  los angeles and san francisco 
our activities constitute a single business segment with two principal sources of revenue financial advisory  which includes engagements relating to mergers and acquisitions  financing advisory and restructuring  and fund placement advisory  and merchant banking  which includes the management of outside capital invested in the firm s merchant banking funds and other similar vehicles  primarily greenhill capital partners gcp i  greenhill capital partners ii gcp ii  greenhill capital partners europe gcp europe  and greenhill sav partners gsavp together with gcp i  gcp ii and gcp europe  the greenhill funds  and the firm s principal investments in the greenhill funds  iridium  other merchant banking funds and other investments 
in the fourth quarter of we announced our intention to separate our merchant banking business to focus entirely on our financial advisory business  and in connection with that decision we sold certain assets of our merchant banking business including the right to raise successor funds to certain of our employees engaged in that business 
after a transition period  which we expect to end in december in the case of gcp  our merchant banking funds will be managed by an independent company although we will retain our principal investments in the merchant banking funds and intend to liquidate those investments over time 
historically  our financial advisory business has accounted for the majority of our revenues 
however  there have been periods  such as the third quarter of  the second quarter of and the first quarter of  in which the revenues of our merchant banking business have outweighed our financial advisory revenues 
since  our first full year as a public company  our financial advisory business has generated approximately of total revenues and our merchant banking and other investment activities have generated approximately of our total revenue 
as a result of our plans to exit the merchant banking business over time  the fees we generate from our management of outside capital in the merchant banking funds will decline in and thereafter  and we do not expect any gains attributable to our profit overrides in our merchant banking funds to be a meaningful portion of our revenues 
since we will retain our existing principal investments in the merchant banking funds and iridium we will continue to generate realized and unrealized investment gains or losses until such investments are liquidated 
the main driver of the financial advisory business is overall mergers and acquisitions  or m a  and restructuring volume  particularly in the industry sectors and geographic markets in which we focus 
we have recruited and plan to continue to recruit new managing directors to expand our industry sector and geographic coverage 
we expect these hires will  over time  add incrementally to our revenue and income growth potential 
in total  we recruited managing directors in  increasing our managing director count on a net basis by 
this group of experienced bankers brings us sector expertise in consumer goods  financial services  gaming and hospitality  infrastructure  and new offices in houston and los angeles 
the principal drivers of our merchant banking revenues are management fees paid by our merchant banking funds  realized and unrealized gains on investments and profit overrides  the size and timing of which are tied to a number of different factors including the performance of the particular companies in which we invest  general economic conditions in the debt and equity markets and other factors which affect the industries in which we invest  such as commodity prices 

table of contents at december   we had three merchant banking funds which are actively investing and we have assets under management in those funds of billion 
as a result of the separation of the merchant banking business  we do not expect to generate any fee revenue from our management of these funds after the completion of a transition period which is expected to end in december in the case of gcp 
in addition  as of december   we owned approximately of iridium common stock 
our revenues can fluctuate materially depending on the number and size of completed transactions on which we advised  the number and size of our investment gains or losses and other factors 
accordingly  the revenues and net income in any particular year may not be indicative of future results 
business environment economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance 
see risk factors 
revenues and net income in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
financial advisory revenues were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   which represents a decrease of 
at the same time  worldwide completed m a volume decreased by  from  billion in to  billion in 
since july the financial markets have experienced a sharp contraction in credit availability and global m a activity 
recent levels of capital markets volatility and an uncertain macroeconomic outlook have further contributed to a volatile and uncertain environment for evaluating many assets  securities and companies  which has created a more difficult environment for m a activity 
there is considerable uncertainty as to how much longer this difficult economic environment may last  although many market participants and observers have noted the beginning of a potential upturn in transaction activity 
because we earn a majority of our financial advisory revenue from fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a merger  acquisition  financing  restructuring or similar transaction or the closing of a fund  our financial advisory business has been negatively impacted and may be further impacted by a reduction in m a activity 
we believe  however  that our simple business model as an independent  unconflicted adviser will create opportunities for us to attract new clients and provide us with excellent recruiting opportunities to further expand our industry expertise and geographic reach 
merchant banking and other investment revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of million 
our merchant banking revenue included an unrealized gain of million resulting from our investment in iridium and a million gain related to the sale of certain merchant banking assets 
the economic and market environment remained difficult in adverse changes in general economic conditions  commodity prices  credit and public equity markets  including a decline in the share price of iridium  could impact negatively the amount of financial advisory and merchant banking revenue realized by the firm

each revenue generating engagement is separately awarded and negotiated 
our list of clients with whom there is an active revenue generating engagement changes continually 
to develop new client relationships  and to develop new engagements from historic client relationships  we maintain a business dialogue with a large number of clients and potential clients  as well as with their financial and legal advisors  on an ongoing basis 
we have gained a significant number of new clients each year through our business development initiatives  through recruiting additional senior investment banking professionals who bring with them client relationships and through referrals from members of boards of directors  attorneys and other parties with whom we have relationships 
at the same time  we lose clients each year as a result of the sale or merger of a client  a change in a client s senior management  competition from other investment banks and other causes 
a majority of our financial advisory revenue is contingent upon the closing of a merger  acquisition  financing  restructuring or similar transaction 
a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons  including failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  failure to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals  failure to secure necessary financing  failure to achieve necessary regulatory approvals and adverse market conditions 
in certain client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  we earn a significant portion of our revenue in the 
table of contents form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment but are not necessarily linked to the end result 
we do not allocate our financial advisory revenue by type of advice rendered m a  financing advisory and restructuring  or other because of the complexity of the assignments for which we earn revenue 
for example  a restructuring assignment can involve  and in some cases end successfully in  a sale of all or part of the financially distressed client 
likewise  an acquisition assignment can relate to a financially distressed target involved in or considering a restructuring 
finally  an m a assignment can develop from a relationship that we had on a prior restructuring assignment  and vice versa 
versus financial advisory revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of

in addition  in our merchant banking and other investment revenue included the gain related to our sale of certain merchant banking assets 
we earn management fees on capital committed to our merchant banking funds generally ranging from to of committed capital during the year commitment period and ranging from 
table of contents to of invested capital after the termination of the applicable commitment period 
in  we earned annual fees from our merchant banking funds of million  and we expect such amount to decline following the termination of the investment period for gcp ii in june the amount of management fees earned from a fund after the termination of the commitment period declines because our fee percentage is lower and the fee calculation is based upon invested capital instead of committed capital 
invested capital will decrease as the investments are liquidated 
as a result of our plan to exit the merchant banking business beginning in the fees we generate from the management of outside capital in our merchant banking funds will decline over time 
furthermore  we expect the full amount of any management fees recorded by us will be used to pay the compensation for and expenses associated with the management of our merchant banking business  any excess will be distributed to gcp capital partners holdings llc 
we recognize revenue on investments in merchant banking funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such funds on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we recognize the consolidated earnings of the general partners of these funds in which we have a majority economic interest  offset by allocated expenses of the funds 
to the extent we make other principal investments  such as iridium  we will also recognize revenue based on the realized and unrealized gains or losses from such investments on a quarterly basis 
we record our investments at estimated fair value 
the value of our merchant banking fund investments in privately held companies is determined on a quarterly basis by the general partner of the fund after giving consideration to the cost of the security  the pricing of other sales of securities by the portfolio company  the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company  purchase multiples paid in other comparable third party transactions  the original purchase price multiple  market conditions  liquidity  operating results and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
discounts may be applied to the funds privately held investments to reflect the lack of liquidity and other transfer restrictions 
investments held by our merchant banking funds as well as those held directly by us in publicly traded securities are valued using quoted market prices discounted for any legal or contractual restrictions on sale 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations as well as the discounts applied  the estimated fair values of investments in privately held companies may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
the values at which our investments are carried on our books are adjusted to estimated fair value at the end of each quarter and the volatility in general economic conditions  stock markets and commodity prices may result in significant changes in the fair value of the investments from quarter to quarter 
significant changes in the estimated fair value of our investments may have a material effect  positive or negative  on our revenues and thus our results of operations 
as the general partner of our merchant banking funds  we are entitled to receive from the funds an override of the profits of the funds after certain performance hurdles are met  whether these hurdles can be met will depend on the underlying fair value of each portfolio company 
overrides are generally calculated on a deal by deal basis but are subject to investment performance over the life of each merchant banking fund 
we may be required to repay a portion of the overrides to the limited partners of the funds in the event a profit override has been realized and paid to the general partner and a minimum performance level is not achieved by the fund as a whole we refer to these potential repayments as clawbacks 
a significant portion of the overrides  if any  will be paid out as employee compensation to those employees who focus primarily on our merchant banking business 
as of december   the net internal rate of return of each investment in gcp ii  gcp europe and gsavp was negative and we have not recognized profit overrides from these investments 
unless we have significant gains in the portfolio companies in each fund it is not likely in the near term that we will exceed the profit threshold for each fund and recognize profit override revenue 
we also recognize gains or losses from our investment in iridium based on the fair market value of our investment as of the end of any period 
as a result of the completion of the acquisition of iridium by ghlac in september we recognized a gain in of million on our investment in iridium 
as of december   we owned  shares of iridium common stock nasdaq irdm and  iridium warrants nasdaq irdmz  or approximately 
table of contents of the iridium common stock on a fully diluted basis 
declines in the fair market value of iridium may adversely affect the amount of merchant banking and other investment revenue recorded in any period 
on december   we completed the sale of certain assets relating to our merchant banking business to gcp capital partners holdings llc  which is principally owned by robert h 
niehaus with no ownership by the firm in exchange for  shares of the firm s common stock  and we recognized a gain in of million 
we deferred approximately million of additional gain on the sale which will be earned under the terms of the agreements with portions of the remaining gain being recognized over the next two to five years 
the assets transferred include the rights to launch successor merchant banking funds  the investment track record  and the existing work force 
in connection with the sale the firm entered into a non compete agreement with gcp capital partners holdings llc and agreed to license certain of the firm s trademarks to gcp capital partners holdings llc for a period of time 
we also agreed to sublease a portion of the premises occupied by our new york office to gcp capital partners holdings llc 
in addition  we agreed that any management fees received by us from the merchant banking funds will be used to pay the compensation and expenses associated with the management of the merchant banking business  any excess will be distributed to gcp capital partners holdings llc 
finally  the share of any profit overrides earned by the merchant banking funds to which we will be entitled was reduced for investments made by the merchant banking funds after january  to out of points from out of points 
versus for the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking and other revenues compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in merchant banking and other investment revenue resulted primarily from the million unrealized gain on the firm s investment in iridium and the million gain related to the sale of certain merchant banking assets in connection with the separation of the merchant banking business 
in there was a slight increase in the fair market value of our investments in the merchant banking funds as compared to a decline in the fair market value of the merchant banking funds in the decrease in management fees in as compared to related to the payment of a transaction fee by a merchant banking portfolio company in  which offset fees payable in during gcp and the firm recognized gains from thirteen portfolio companies and recorded losses on nine portfolio companies

the gain recognized by the firm on its investment in iridium in contributed more than to total revenues 
the firm had no gains on investments in that contributed more than to total revenues 
versus for the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking and other investment revenue compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease principally resulted from a decline in the fair market value of merchant banking funds and reversal of overrides accrued in prior periods in gcp i  offset by slightly higher asset management fees resulting principally from greater assets under management 
during gcp and the firm recognized gains from nine of our portfolio companies and recorded losses on seventeen portfolio companies 
in gcp and the firm recognized gains related to twelve portfolio companies and recorded losses related to seven portfolio companies 
the firm had no gains on investments in or that contributed more than to total revenues in those years 
the investment gains or losses in our merchant banking and other investment portfolio may fluctuate significantly over time due to factors beyond our control  such as performance of each company in our portfolio  equity market valuations  commodity prices and merger and acquisition opportunities 
revenue recognized from gains or losses recorded in any particular period are not necessarily indicative of revenue that may be realized and or recognized in future periods 
operating expenses our total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  which compares to million of total operating expenses for the year ended december  the 
table of contents increase of million  or  relates principally to an increase in compensation expense described in more detail below 
the pre tax income margin was in compared to in we classify operating expenses as employee compensation and benefits expense and non compensation expenses 
management does not separately evaluate operating expenses by financial advisory and merchant banking activities 
operating expenses apart from compensation have been modest in proportion to revenues  as a result of the relatively small number of staff and related costs including travel  office space  communications  information services  depreciation  professional services and interest expense that the firm bears 
a portion of certain costs are reimbursed by clients under the terms of client engagements 
the following table sets forth information relating to our operating expenses  which are reported net of reimbursements of certain expenses by our clients and merchant banking portfolio companies for the year ended december  in millions  except employee data number of employees at year end employee compensation and benefits expense of revenues non compensation expense of revenues total operating expense of revenues total income before taxes pre tax income margin compensation and benefits expenses the principal component of our operating expenses is employee compensation and benefits expense 
it is our policy that our total compensation and benefits  including that payable to our managing directors and senior advisors  will not exceed of total revenues each year although we retain the ability to change this policy in the future 
the actual compensation expense ratio is determined by management in consultation with the compensation committee and based on such factors as the relative level of revenues  the anticipated compensation requirements which may vary depending on the level of recruitment of new managing directors in any given period and other factors  and the level of other costs and expenses 
the compensation we pay to our employees consists of base salary and benefits  annual incentive compensation payable as cash bonus awards and long term incentive compensation awards of restricted stock units 
base salary and benefits are paid ratably throughout the year 
cash bonuses  which are accrued each quarter  are discretionary and dependent upon a number of factors  including the performance of the firm and are generally paid annually in february following year end 
awards of restricted stock units are also discretionary and amortized to compensation expense based upon the value of the award at the time of grant during the service period over which the award vests  which is generally five years 
as we expense these awards  the restricted stock units recognized are recorded within stockholders equity 
in january  our employees were granted  restricted stock units as part of the long term incentive award program 
versus for the year ended december   our employee compensation and benefits expenses were million  which compares to million of compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  the increase of million or is due to the higher level of revenues in compared to for the year ended december   the ratio of compensation to revenues was  which was the same as

accordingly  the amount of compensation expense recognized in any particular year may not be indicative of compensation expense in a future period 
non compensation expenses our non compensation expenses include the costs for occupancy and equipment rental  communications  information services  professional fees  recruiting  travel and entertainment  insurance  depreciation  interest expense and other operating expenses 
reimbursable client expenses are netted against non compensation expenses 
over the long term we expect that our non compensation costs  particularly occupancy  travel and information services costs  will increase as we grow our business and make strategic investments 
versus for the year ended december   our non compensation expenses were million  which compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million or 
the increase is principally related to the absence of foreign currency gains compared with  higher professional fees attributable to the sale of certain merchant banking assets and an advisory assignment  higher occupancy costs related to the addition of new offices  partially offset by decreased interest expense due to lower average borrowings outstanding 
non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year reflects higher expenses spread over significantly higher revenues 
versus for the year ended december   our non compensation expenses were million  which compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million or 
the increase is principally related to higher occupancy costs associated with rental rate increases and new office space  increased information service costs primarily attributable to the growth in personnel  and higher interest expense related to greater average short term borrowings  partially offset by the absence of a provisions for legal contingencies in as compared to the same period in non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  were 
this compares to for the year ended december  the increase in these non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue in as compared to reflects slightly higher expenses spread over significantly lower revenues 
the firm s non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary as a result of a variety of factors including fluctuation in annual revenue amounts  the amount of recruiting and business development activity  the amount of office expansion  the amount of reimbursement of engagement related expenses by clients  the amount of our short term borrowings  interest rate and currency movements and other factors 
accordingly  the non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue in any particular year may not be indicative of the non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue in future years 
provision for income taxes we are subject to federal  foreign and state and local corporate income taxes

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity position is monitored by our management committee  which generally meets monthly 
the management committee monitors cash  other significant working capital assets and liabilities  debt  principal investment commitments and other matters relating to liquidity requirements 
as cash accumulates it is invested in short term investments expected to provide significant liquidity 
we generate cash from both our operating activities in the form of financial advisory fees  asset management fees and our merchant banking and other principal investments principally in the form of distributions of investment proceeds 
we use our cash primarily for operating purposes  compensation of our employees  payment of income taxes  investments in merchant banking funds  payment of dividends  repurchase of shares of our stock and leasehold improvements 
because a portion of the compensation we pay to our employees is distributed in annual bonus awards in february of each year  our net cash balance is generally at its lowest level during the first quarter and accumulates throughout the remainder of the year 
our cash balances generally accumulate from our operating activities during the year 
in general  we collect our accounts receivable within days except for certain restructuring transactions where collections may take longer due to court ordered holdbacks and fees generated through our fund placement advisory services  which are generally paid in installments over a period of three years 
our liabilities typically consist of accounts payable  which are generally paid monthly  accrued compensation  which includes accrued cash bonuses that are paid in the first quarter of the following year to the large majority of our employees  and taxes payable 
in february  cash bonuses and accrued benefits of million relating to compensation were paid to our employees 
in addition  we expect to pay approximately million in early related to income taxes owed for the year ended december  since our initial public offering we have used a portion of our cash reserves to repurchase shares of our common stock  pay dividends and make investments 
our commitments to our merchant banking funds may require us to fund capital calls on short notice 
on the other hand  distributions from our merchant banking funds are generally made shortly after proceeds are received by the funds 
we are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of share repurchases  capital calls or distribution of investment proceeds 

table of contents our merchant banking funds typically invest in privately held companies 
the ability of our merchant banking funds to sell or dispose of the securities they own depends on a number of factors beyond the control of the funds  including general economic and sector conditions  stock market conditions  commodity prices  and the availability of financing to potential buyers of such securities  among other issues 
as a result we consider our investments illiquid for the short term 
similarly  our investment in iridium is restricted from sale until late september or until late march in the case of a registered offering and our ability to sell all or a portion of our investment is subject to factors such as general economic  sector and stock market conditions which we cannot control 
however  following the lapse of the resale restrictions  it is our intention to monetize our position in a disciplined manner over a significant period of time dependent on market conditions 
pursuant to the agreements entered into in connection with the sale of certain of our merchant banking assets we no longer receive any economic benefit from the management of the existing merchant banking funds 
specifically  beginning in  we expect the full amount of any management fees recorded by us for accounting purposes will be used to pay the compensation for and expenses associated with the management of our merchant banking business  and any excess will be distributed to gcp capital partners holdings llc 
we will  however  retain our existing investments in the merchant banking funds and plan to liquidate those investments over time 
we do not expect that any gains attributable to our interest in the profit overrides of the merchant banking funds will contribute meaningful amounts of cash to our balance sheet 
as of december   we had total commitments not reflected on our balance sheet relating to future principal investments in gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe and other merchant banking and related activities of million 
these commitments  which may not be drawn in full  are expected to be drawn on from time to time and be substantially invested over a period of up to five years from the relevant commitment dates 
in january we funded capital calls of million 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 
to provide for working capital needs  facilitate the funding of merchant banking investments and other general corporate purposes we have a revolving bank loan facility 
borrowings under the facility are secured by all management fees earned by our domestic merchant banking funds and any cash distributed in respect of their partnership interests in gcp i  gcp ii and gsavp  as applicable 
interest on borrowings is based on the higher of prime rate or 
the revolving loan commitment  which currently expires on march   has been extended to april   subject to completion of certain documentation 
the commitment amount is currently million and reduces to million effective april  and million effective december  and is subject to borrowing base limitations 
the borrowing rate will remain the same as the current facility 
in conjunction with our plan to exit from the merchant banking business we will significantly reduce our commitments to successor merchant banking funds thereby reducing our borrowing needs 
at december  we had million of borrowings outstanding on the loan facility 
as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million  of which million were held outside the us we are subject to federal income tax on our domestic earnings and that portion of our foreign earnings which we repatriate 
it has been our policy to retain approximately of our foreign earnings within our foreign operating units to minimize our global tax burden and to fund our foreign investment needs 
however  in the event our cash needs in the us exceed our cash reserves and availability under the revolving loan facility  we may repatriate additional cash from our foreign operations  which could result in an incremental tax charge 
during  we are deemed to have repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share as a result of the payment of tax liabilities in respect of stock delivered to our employees in settlement of restricted stock units 
on december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock held by robert h 
niehaus and v 
frank pottow as part of our plan to exit the merchant banking business 

table of contents we evaluate our cash operating position on a regular basis in light of current market conditions 
our recurring monthly operating disbursements consist of base compensation expense and other operating expenses  which principally include rent and occupancy  information services  professional fees  travel and entertainment and other general expenses 
our recurring quarterly and annual disbursements consist of tax payments  dividend distributions  repurchases of our common stock from our employees in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities incurred on vesting of restricted stock units and cash bonus payments 
these amounts vary depending upon our profitability and other factors 
we incur non recurring disbursements for our investments in our merchant banking funds and other principal payments  leasehold improvements and share repurchases 
while we believe that the cash generated from operations and funds available from the revolving bank loan facility will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  commitments to our merchant banking activities  build out costs of new office space  tax obligations  share repurchases and common dividends  we may adjust our variable expenses and non recurring disbursements  if necessary  to meet our liquidity needs 
in the event that our needs for liquidity should increase further as we expand our business  we may consider a range of financing alternatives to meet any such needs 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased by million in  including an increase of million resulting from the effect of the translation of foreign currency amounts into us dollars at the year end foreign currency conversion rates 
we generated million in operating activities  including million from net income after giving effect to the non cash items and a net decrease in working capital of million principally from a decrease in taxes payable offset by an increase in accrued compensation payable 
we generated million in investing activities  including million related to distributions received from our merchant banking investments partially offset by million in new investments in our merchant banking funds and other investments and million for the build out of new office space 
we used million for financing activities  including million for the repurchase of our common stock from employees in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities in settlement of vested restricted stock units and million for the payment of dividends  partially offset by million of net borrowings from our revolving loan facility

contractual obligations the following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions operating lease obligations revolving loan facility merchant banking commitments a b total c a we may be required to substantially fund our merchant banking commitments at any time through  depending on the timing and level of investments by gcp ii  gcp europe and gsavp  although we do not expect these commitments to be drawn in full 
since the merchant banking commitments can be drawn at any time over the life of the commitment period  the amounts above are shown as if spread ratably over the life of the primary commitment period 
the commitment period for gcp ii will expire in june and up to of the commitment may be drawn for follow on investments over the two year period after the expiration of the commitment period 
the remaining commitment outstanding to gcp europe has been converted from pounds sterling to us dollars at the effective rate as of december  for purposes of inclusion in this table 
b excludes our commitment of million to a successor fund to gcp ii and million to a successor fund to gsavp  subject to certain conditions  payable over five years from the date of inception of each fund 
c total contractual obligations have not been reduced by approximately million in minimum sublease rentals due in the future under noncancelable subleases 
market risk we limit our investments to short term cash investments  which we believe do not face any material interest rate risk  equity price risk or other market risk and principal investments made in gcp  gsavp  gcp europe and other merchant banking funds  iridium and other investments 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings 
we may maintain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured fdic limits and in institutions in which deposits are not insured 
however  management believes that the firm is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held 
we monitor the quality of these investments on a regular basis and may choose to diversify such investments to mitigate perceived market risk 
our short term cash investments are primarily denominated in us dollars  canadian dollars  pound sterling and euros  and we face modest foreign currency risk in our cash balances held in accounts outside the united states due to potential currency movements and the associated foreign currency translation accounting requirements 
to the extent that the cash balances in local currency exceed our short term obligations  we may hedge our foreign currency exposure 
with regard to our principal investments we face exposure to changes in the estimated fair value of the companies in which we invest  which historically has been volatile 
significant changes in the public equity markets may have a material effect on our results of operations 
volatility in the general equity markets would impact our operations primarily because of changes in the fair value of our merchant banking or principal investments that are publicly traded securities 
volatility in the 
table of contents availability of credit would impact our operations primarily because of changes in the fair value of merchant banking or principal investments that rely upon a portion of leverage to operate 
we have analyzed our potential exposure to general equity market risk by performing sensitivity analyses on those investments held by us and in our merchant banking funds which consist of publicly traded securities 
this analysis showed that if we assume that at december   the market prices of all public securities  including iridium  were lower  the impact on our operations would be a decrease in revenues of million 
we meet on a quarterly basis to determine the fair value of the investments held in our merchant banking portfolio and to discuss the risks associated with those investments 
the respective investment committees manage the risks associated with the merchant banking portfolio by closely monitoring and managing the types of investments made as well as the monetization and realization of existing investments 
in addition  the reported amounts of our revenues may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the euro  pound sterling and canadian dollar in which collectively of our revenues for the year ended december  were denominated and the dollar  in which our financial statements are denominated 
we do not currently hedge against movements in these exchange rates 
we analyzed our potential exposure to a decline in exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis on our net income 
because of the weakening in value of the dollar  on weighted average basis  relative to the pound sterling and euro in as compared to the same period in  our earnings in were higher than they would have been in the same period in the prior year had the value of the dollar relative to those other currencies remained constant 
however  we do not believe we face any material risk in this respect 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following discussion addresses greenhill s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
basis of financial information our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted gaap in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes  including investment valuations  compensation accruals and other matters 
we believe that the estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior year information to conform to current year presentation 
the consolidated financial statements of the firm include all consolidated accounts of greenhill co  inc and all other entities in which we have a controlling interest  including greenhill co 
international llp  greenhill co 
europe llp and greenhill capital partners europe llp  after eliminations of all significant inter company accounts and transactions 
in accordance with the accounting pronouncements on the consolidation of variable interest entities  the firm consolidates the general partners of our merchant banking funds in which we have a majority of the economic interest 
the general partners account for their investments in their merchant banking funds under the equity method of accounting 
as such  the general partners record their proportionate share of income loss from the underlying merchant banking funds 
as the merchant banking funds follow investment company accounting  and generally record all their assets and liabilities at fair value  the general partners investment in merchant banking funds represents an estimation of fair value 
the firm does not consolidate the merchant banking funds since the firm  through its general partner and limited partner interests  does not have a majority of the economic interest in such funds and the limited partners have certain rights to remove the general partner by a simple majority vote of unaffiliated third party investors 

table of contents noncontrolling interests effective january   the firm recorded the noncontrolling interests of other consolidated entities as equity as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
additionally  the consolidated statements of income separately present income allocated to both noncontrolling interests and common stockholders 
the firm has revised its prior year presentation  as required  to conform to this new presentation 
the portion of the consolidated interests in the general partners of our merchant banking funds  which are held directly by employees of the firm  are presented as noncontrolling interests in equity 
revenue recognition financial advisory fees we recognize financial advisory fee revenue for mergers and acquisitions or financing advisory and restructuring engagements when the services related to the underlying transactions are completed in accordance with the terms of the engagement letters 
the firm recognizes fund placement advisory fees at the time of the client s acceptance of capital or capital commitments in accordance with the terms of the engagement letter 
retainer fees are recognized as financial advisory fee revenue over the period in which the related service is rendered 
our clients reimburse certain expenses incurred by us in the conduct of financial advisory engagements 
expenses are reported net of such client reimbursements 
merchant banking and other investment revenues merchant banking revenues consist of i management fees on our merchant banking activities  ii gains or losses on investments in our merchant banking funds and other principal investment activities  and iii merchant banking profit overrides 
management fees earned from the firm s merchant banking activities are recognized over the period of related service 
we recognize revenue on investments in our merchant banking funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such funds 
investments held by merchant banking funds and certain other investments are recorded at estimated fair value 
the value of merchant banking fund investments in privately held companies is determined by the general partner of the fund after giving consideration to the cost of the security  the pricing of other sales of securities by the portfolio company  the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company  purchase multiples paid in other comparable third party transactions  the original purchase price multiple  market conditions  liquidity  operating results and other qualitative and quantitative factors 
discounts may be applied to the funds privately held investments to reflect the lack of liquidity and other transfer restrictions 
investments in publicly traded securities are valued using quoted market prices discounted for any legal or contractual restrictions on sale 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations as well as the discounts applied  the estimated fair values of investments in privately held companies may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
the values at which our investments are carried on our books are adjusted to estimated fair value at the end of each quarter and the volatility in general economic conditions  stock markets and commodity prices may result in significant changes in the estimated fair value of the investments from period to period 
we recognize merchant banking profit overrides when certain financial returns are achieved over the life of the fund 
profit overrides are generally calculated as a percentage of the profits over a specified threshold earned by each fund on investments managed on behalf of unaffiliated investors for gcp i and principally all investors except the firm for gcp ii  gcp europe and gsavp 
the profit overrides earned by the firm are recognized on an accrual basis throughout the year 
in accordance with the guidance for accounting for formula based fees  the firm records as revenue the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund agreements at each period end as if the fund agreements were terminated at that date 
overrides are generally calculated on a deal by deal basis but are subject to 
table of contents investment performance over the life of each merchant banking fund 
we may be required to repay a portion of the overrides paid to the limited partners of the funds in the event a minimum performance level is not achieved by the fund as a whole we refer to these potential repayments as clawbacks 
we would be required to establish a reserve for potential clawbacks if we were to determine that the likelihood of a clawback is probable and the amount of the clawback can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we have not reserved for any clawback obligations under applicable fund agreements 
investments the firm s investments in merchant banking funds are recorded under the equity method of accounting based upon the firm s proportionate share of the fair value of the underlying merchant banking fund s net assets 
the firm s other investments  which consider the firm s influence or control of the investee  are recorded at estimated fair value or under the equity method of accounting based upon the firm s proportionate share of the investee s net assets  as described below 
restricted stock units the firm accounts for its share based compensation payments under which the fair value of restricted stock units granted to employees with future service requirements is recorded as compensation expense and generally amortized over a five year service period following the date of grant 
compensation expense is determined at the date of grant 
as the firm expenses the awards  the restricted stock units recognized are recorded within equity 
the restricted stock units are reclassed into common stock and additional paid in capital upon vesting 
the firm records dividend equivalent payments  net of estimated forfeitures  on outstanding restricted stock units as a dividend payment and a charge to equity 
earnings per share the firm calculates basic earnings per share eps by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps includes the determinants of basic eps plus the dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable pursuant to restricted stock units for which future service is required as a condition to the delivery of the underlying common stock 
under the treasury method  the number of shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share is the excess  if any  of the number of shares expected to be issued  less the number of shares that could be purchased by the firm with the proceeds to be received upon settlement at the average market closing price during the reporting period 
the denominator for basic eps includes the number of shares deemed issuable due to the vesting of restricted stock units for accounting purposes 
effective on january   the firm adopted the accounting guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
under that guidance the firm evaluated whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating eps 
additionally  the two class method requires unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents to be treated as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect in calculating earnings per share 
provision for taxes the firm accounts for taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes topic  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities 

table of contents the firm follows the guidelines  pursuant to fasb asc topic formerly fin  in recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in its financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expects to take on its income tax returns 
income tax expense is based on pre tax accounting income  including adjustments made for the recognition or derecognition related to uncertain tax positions 
the recognition or derecognition of income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions is determined under the guidance as prescribed by fasb asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
the firm s deferred tax liabilities are presented as a component of taxes payable on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
management applies the more likely than not criteria included in fasb asc topic when determining tax benefits 
cash and cash equivalents the firm considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less  when purchased  to be cash equivalents 
at december  and  the carrying value of the firm s cash equivalents approximated fair value 
cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds and overnight deposits 
the firm maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings 
the firm maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured fdic limits and in institutions in which deposits are not insured 
however  management believes that the firm is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held 
financial instruments and fair value the firm adopted the provisions of fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures topic  as of january  fasb asc topic establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the pronouncement are described below basis of fair value measurement level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  and level prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
a financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
in determining the appropriate levels  the firm performs a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities that are subject to fasb asc topic at each reporting period  all assets and liabilities for which the fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs or instruments which trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency are classified as level derivative instruments the firm accounts for the warrants under the guidance for accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in accordance with that guidance  the firm records warrants at estimated fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in estimated fair value during the period recorded in merchant banking and other revenue in the consolidated statements of income
