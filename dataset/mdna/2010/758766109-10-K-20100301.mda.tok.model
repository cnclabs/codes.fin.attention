overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states and the district of columbia as of december  we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations 
we also maintain an investment in national cinemedia  which concentrates on in theatre advertising and creating complementary business lines that leverage the operating personnel  asset and customer bases of its theatrical exhibition partners  which include us  amc and cinemark 
the company manages its business under one reportable segment theatre exhibition operations 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs  our gift card and discount ticket programs and various other activities in our theatres 
in addition  national cinemedia provides us with a theatre access fee associated with revenues generated from its sale of on screen advertising  rental of theatres for meetings and concerts and other events 
film rental costs depend on a variety of factors including the prospects of a film  the popularity and box office revenues of a film  and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs 
on february   we  along with amc and cinemark  formed dcip  to create a financing model and establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema

results of operations based on our review of industry sources  national box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to regal s fiscal year of were estimated to have increased by approximately in comparison to the fiscal year of the industry s box office results were positively impacted by ticket price increases  growth in premium priced imax and d films and the breadth of key films released in the fiscal year of  which included strong attendance from releases such as transformers revenge of the fallen  harry potter and the half blood prince  avatar  the twilight saga new moon and up 
our total revenues for the fifty two week year ended december  fiscal period were  million and consisted of  million of admissions revenues  million of concessions revenues and million of other operating revenues  and increased approximately from total revenues of  million for the fifty three week fiscal year ended january  fiscal period 
total admissions revenues increased million during the fiscal period  or  to  million  from  million in the fiscal period primarily due to a increase in average ticket prices  partially offset by a decrease in attendance 
we believe the overall decrease in attendance during the fiscal period was primarily a result of the timing of the fiscal period calendar  which consisted of fifty three weeks compared to fifty two weeks during the fiscal period 
the overall decrease in fiscal period attendance was mitigated by the full benefit twelve months in the fiscal period as compared to eight months in the fiscal period of the inclusion of screens acquired from consolidated theatres during the fiscal period 
price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary trends and local market conditions along with an increase in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium priced imax and d films exhibited during the fiscal period were the primary drivers of the increase in our fiscal period average ticket prices 
based on our review of certain industry sources  the increase in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was approximately basis points less than the industry s results for the fiscal period as compared to fiscal period 
we believe our less than industry increase in admissions revenues on a per screen basis was largely attributable to geographical differences in film product performance and to a lesser extent  the impact of incremental competitor screens 

table of contents during the fiscal period  we continued to make progress with respect to the following strategic initiatives we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the fiscal period totaled approximately million 
we opened theatres with screens and closed underperforming theatres with screens  ending the fiscal period with theatres and  screens 
finally  we continued to expand our use of new technologies to enhance the movie going experience and broaden our content offerings 
specifically  the installation of digital projection systems  when combined with d technology or imax theatre systems  allow us to offer our patrons premium d and large format movie experiences that we believe generate incremental revenue for the company 
as of december   we operated imax screens and operated additional screens outfitted with digital d projection systems 
in addition  we ultimately expect to outfit all of our screens with digital projection systems  with approximately  screens being digital d capable 
we remain optimistic regarding the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with d film product and other d content and are pleased to see growing support of d and imax film product by the major motion picture studios 
we are optimistic regarding the breadth of the film slate  including the timing of the release schedule and the number of films scheduled for release in premium priced formats 
evidenced by the motion picture studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of high profile releases such as alice in wonderland  how to train your dragon  iron man  shrek forever after  sex and the city  toy story  the twilight saga eclipse  inception  megamind  harry potter and the deathly hallows part  the chronicles of narnia the voyage of the dawn treader  tron legacy  the green hornet and gulliver s travels 
we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions 
with respect to capital expenditures  subject to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and replacements 
overall for the fiscal year  we expect to benefit from modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron and a continued increase in d screens and the number of films scheduled for release in premium priced formats 
in addition  we expect fiscal admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations 
we will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities  selective upgrades and providing incremental returns to our stockholders

table of contents our revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit cards at the point of sale

we expect that with respect to our existing theatres  dcip will cover substantially all of the costs of installing digital projection systems  and with respect to our new build theatres  dcip will cover substantially all of the estimated incremental cost of digital projection systems over conventional film projectors 
we expect dcip to fund the cost of conversion through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors 
we will bear operating and maintenance costs with respect to digital projection systems in our theatres  which we expect to be relatively comparable to what we currently spend on our conventional film projectors 
we have made incremental investments in digital projectors and d projection technology to selectively add d capable digital projection systems to our circuit to capture incremental d admissions revenues 
to that end  as of december   we operated imax screens and operated additional screens outfitted with digital d projection systems 
we expect dcip to complete the execution of definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection during the first quarter of the anticipated financing is expected to cover the cost of conversion for approximately of our circuit s screens 
we ultimately expect to outfit all of our screens with digital projection systems  with approximately  screens being digital d capable 
in the event that future additional financing is unavailable to complete the conversion of the remaining screens in our circuit as expected  we may have to incur additional capital expenditures in order to complete the full conversion of our circuit 
as of the date of this form k  we have already begun to convert our existing theatres from mm film projection to digital projection and intend to complete the conversion of our entire circuit in approximately three to four years 
we believe the installation of digital projection systems  when combined with d technology or imax theatre systems  will allow us to offer our patrons premium d and large format movie experiences  which we believe will generate incremental revenue for the company 
we remain optimistic about the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with d film product and other d content and are pleased to see growing support of d and imax film product by the major motion picture studios 
we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
the company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects  with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the company s internal rate of return targets 
the credit crisis of late and early negatively impacted real estate development and has caused a temporary slowdown in our 
table of contents building program 
as a result  we currently expect capital expenditures for theatre development  replacement  expansion  upgrading and replacements to be below our historical levels and in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal year  exclusive of acquisitions 
such capital expenditures are expected to be partially funded through asset dispositions conducted during the normal course of our business 
during the fiscal period  we invested approximately million in capital expenditures

ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda were approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the net decrease in ebitda in the fiscal period from the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income during the fiscal period 
the company uses ebitda as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity  excluding the impact of interest  taxes  and non cash depreciation and amortization charges  for servicing our debt  paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs  prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash  such as working capital items 
we believe that ebitda is useful to investors for these purposes as well 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net cash provided by operating activities  as determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  since it omits the impact of interest  taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash such as receivables  payables and inventories as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items such as long term loss accruals and deferred items 
because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized  which assets will often have to be replaced in the future 
further  ebitda  because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service  income taxes  cash dividends  capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to 
table of contents time as described in more detail elsewhere in this form k  does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes 
nonetheless  ebitda is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors  rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe  and we concur  that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures  pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs  respectively 
we also evaluate ebitda because it is clear that movements in these non gaap measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends

interest rate swaps as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  regal cinemas had three interest rate swap agreements effective as of january   which hedged an aggregate of approximately million of variable rate debt obligations 
during the quarter ended april   regal cinemas entered into four additional hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with maturity terms of two to three years each from the respective effective dates of the swaps  which require regal cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from to and receive interest at a variable rate 
these interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately  million of variable rate debt obligations and became effective during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the three interest rate swaps effective as of january  matured 
as a result  the company s four interest rate swap agreements effective as of december  hedge an aggregate of approximately  million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 
on september   because of the sudden deterioration in the credit standing of the lehman counterparty to an interest rate swap agreement designated to hedge approximately million of variable rate debt obligations  the company concluded that the hedging relationship was no longer expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows 
as a result  on september   the hedging relationship ceased to qualify for hedge accounting 
for the period from september  through september   the company recognized million the change in fair value of the former hedging derivative as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
on october   the lehman counterparty filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  an event of default occurred under the provisions of the interest rate swap agreement between the company and the lehman counterparty  which effectively terminated the interest rate swap on october   as indicated above 
accordingly  million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of october  will be reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings ie  when interest payments are made on the variable rate debt obligations as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining life of the two year original hedge as long as the variable rate debt obligations remain outstanding 
during the quarter ended october   the company released the final portion of the deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss by recording interest expense net of related tax effects of approximately million and a corresponding million reduction of other comprehensive loss 
in addition  during the year ended december   the company paid a final termination value of approximately million including accrued interest associated with the interest rate swap 
under the terms of the company s effective interest rate swap agreements as of december   regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from to and receives interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three month period 
the interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration 
at such dates  the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense 
no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the interest rate swaps  because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into 
the interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such  the company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the month 
table of contents libor on approximately  million of variable rate obligations 
the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings interest expense 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the designated hedging instruments the three interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap 
as of december   the aggregate fair value of the company s four interest rate swaps was determined to be approximately million  which was recorded as a component of other non current liabilities with a corresponding amount of million  net of tax  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net 
as of january   the aggregate fair value of effective interest rate swaps was determined to be approximately million  which was recorded as a component of accrued expenses with a corresponding amount of million  net of tax  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net 
these interest rate swaps exhibited no ineffectiveness during the years ended december   january  and december  and accordingly  the net losses on the swaps of million  million and million  respectively  were reported as a component of other comprehensive loss for the years ended december   january  and december  the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps is based on level inputs as described in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  and represents the estimated amount regal cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors  including current interest rates  credit risk and counterparty credit risk

sale leaseback transactions for information regarding our various sale and leaseback transactions  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which include those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting 
table of contents estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions 
under purchase accounting principles  we are required to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities  including i the acquired tangible and intangible assets  including property and equipment  ii the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition  and iii the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations  for significant acquisitions  we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to make these valuation estimates  which are made based on information available to us at the acquisition date 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
historically  the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and  as a result  we have not disclosed such changes 
asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management s best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film s opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
the ultimate revenues of a film can be estimated reasonably accurately within a few weeks after the film is released based on the film s initial box office performance  which is determined by a film s initial box office receipts 
as a result  there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable  because we make such estimates based on each film s box office receipts through the end of the reporting period 
for the fiscal years ended december   january  and december   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than forty years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment  etc  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and mm projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their 
table of contents depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
to the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolescent  we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our properties have been appraised 
such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended december   january  and december   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended december   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately million or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
an increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
a decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
additionally  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation  require judgment by us and may be challenged by the tax authorities 
as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  effective december   the company adopted the provisions of asc subtopic  income taxes overview 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  in accordance with asc subtopic  we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position 
with respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate  the 
table of contents benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes 
among other items deemed relevant by us  the evaluations are based on new legislation  other new technical guidance  judicial proceedings  and our specific circumstances  including the progress of tax audits 
any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made 
for fiscal  our provision for income taxes was million 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained  the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate 
a one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from to would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately million
