all explanations of changes in operational results are discussed in order of magnitude 
overview fiscal financial results in fiscal  our net revenues decreased to  from  in fiscal across brands  we saw improving sales trends and steadily increasing selling margins throughout the year  which led to an increase in our diluted earnings per share of  to in fiscal from in fiscal to generate these results  we delivered the highest operating contribution rate in the history of our direct to customer segment  reduced our selling  general and administrative expense rate  strategically reduced our inventories to their lowest level in five years ending the year at  while gaining market share  and generated more cash in one year than ever before  ending the year with  retail net revenues in fiscal decreased by  or  compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the continued negative impact of the general economic environment during fiscal  which resulted in a comparable store sales decrease of  as well as the temporary and permanent closure of stores and stores  respectively 
this revenue decrease was partially offset by new store openings and the remodeling or expansion of an additional stores 
the net revenue decrease was led by the pottery barn and pottery barn kids brands 
in our direct to customer channel  net revenues in fiscal decreased by  or  compared to fiscal this decrease was driven by declining net revenues in all brands primarily due to the continued negative impact of the general economic environment during fiscal additionally  our catalog and page circulation decreased and  respectively including the impact of our catalog circulation optimization strategy 
in our core brands  net revenues decreased by  compared to fiscal  driven by declining net revenues in all brands led by pottery barn and pottery barn kids  due to the continued negative impact of the general economic environment during fiscal comparable store sales decreases were  and for the pottery barn kids  pottery barn and williams sonoma brands  respectively 
although net revenues decreased  we continued to see economic resilience throughout the year in the williams sonoma brand 
sales trends  however  improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when comparable store sales were positive in all core brands 
similar to our core brands  our emerging brands including west elm  pbteen and williams sonoma home also continued to be impacted by the general economic environment 
net revenues decreased compared to fiscal  driven by declining net revenues in all brands 
in williams sonoma home  after another difficult year and an extensive review of our strategic alternatives  we concluded that the future potential of this brand is limited 
as such  we are working on a plan to restructure the unprofitable segments of the business  including the operations of our retail stores 
as part of this restructuring  it is our intent to market those merchandising categories that support our bridal registry  expanded flagship and designer assortments through the williams sonoma kitchen brand 
these categories will be available both on line and in select williams sonoma stores 
fiscal operational results in supply chain  we saw greater than expected benefits from the distribution  transportation and quality returns initiatives that we had implemented throughout the year 
these initiatives included implementing distribution 
table of contents accuracy programs to reduce inventory shrinkage and improve customer service  regionalizing large cube inventory to consolidate furniture shipments  lower shipping costs and enhance the customer experience  insourcing our ohio furniture delivery hub to bring company managed volume to over and reduce damages and replacements  and aggressively managing inventory flow to reduce distribution square footage by 
in international sourcing  we completed the transition of our asian furniture network 
this initiative has allowed us to establish local expertise  improve vendor performance and reduce furniture returns  replacements and damages 
many of the products which are currently driving the turnaround in the pottery barn and pottery barn kids brands were sourced under this new initiative 
in information technology  we completed the rollout of our new e commerce platform at the end of the third quarter 
this platform enables our merchants to make rapid changes on the sites without it intervention  optimizes natural search returns and provides customers with faster download times and easier navigation 
we also implemented new functionality related to customer insights  which is allowing us to generate more relevant emails and improve catalog productivity 
while much opportunity lies ahead of us in both of these areas  these initiatives are driving increased traffic and incremental sales to the brands 
in real estate  our occupancy cost reduction initiatives were a key focus throughout the year  and we made significant progress 
in  we closed  square feet of distribution space   square feet of corporate office space and retail stores 
lastly  during fiscal  we established a multi year franchise agreement with the mh alshaya company to launch our portfolio of brands in the middle east 
we opened our first franchised pottery barn and pottery barn kids stores in dubai in march and will open two additional stores in kuwait in the second quarter of fiscal we believe with this business model  there is a significant opportunity to expand the reach of our brands outside of north america 
fiscal as we look forward to fiscal  we will continue to capitalize on the benefits of our initiatives that have not yet been fully realized and focus on the five key initiatives that are driving our momentum today including implementing innovative growth strategies to capture market share  delivering superior customer service  executing our catalog and internet marketing initiatives  driving supply chain efficiencies  and maximizing profitability and cash flow 
to capture market share  we plan to continue to introduce and market new products with an emphasis on innovation  exclusivity and value 
we also plan to increase our investment in e commerce 
we believe that one of our most competitive advantages in this post recessionary economy is our ability to serve customers in the channel of their choice  and the internet is increasingly becoming that channel for both product research and purchases 
we believe that as time passes and the economy improves  there is an opportunity for our brands to capture market share from those retailers who have closed stores and do not have significant multi channel capabilities  have become less relevant or have failed completely in these difficult times 
in the area of customer service  our focus will be on expanding the clienteling services program that we launched last year in our pottery barn stores 
in fiscal  we will complete the rollout of this program in west elm 
to execute our catalog and internet marketing initiatives  we plan to continue to refine our catalog circulation by increasing the use of versioning and special mailers  while continuing to shift catalog dollars into e marketing 
e commerce is our fastest growing and most profitable channel and we plan to continue to identify new opportunities to build brand awareness and customer engagement through search  e mail modeling  affiliate programs and enhanced functionality 
to drive further supply chain efficiencies  we plan to continue to capitalize on the benefits from the initiatives we rolled out in fiscal  as well as continue to expand the insourcing of our third party furniture delivery hubs  reengineer inbound packaging to reduce the cubic volume of shipments through the supply chain to reduce packaging  transportation and distribution warehousing costs  and implement the first phase of our east coast distribution center consolidation that  after moving costs are covered  will result in lower rent  utility and labor costs

in addition  we also plan to tightly manage inventory and overall capital spending 
finally  we remain confident in the cash generating power of our multi channel  multi brand business model and our ability to generate cash flow in excess of the funding requirements necessary to grow and operate our business  even in the current economic environment 
accordingly  in fiscal  our board of directors authorized an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from to per common share  subject to capital availability  for a total annual payout of approximately

comparable store sales comparable stores are defined as those stores in which gross square footage did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days 
by measuring the year over year sales of merchandise in the stores that have a history of being open for a full comparable months or more  we can better gauge how the core store base is performing since it excludes new store openings  store remodelings and expansions 
comparable stores exclude new retail concepts until such time as we believe that comparable store results in those concepts are of sufficient size to evaluate the performance of the retail strategy  therefore  fiscal  and total comparable store sales exclude the west elm and williams sonoma home concepts 
percentages represent changes in comparable store sales versus the same period in the prior year

table of contents among distribution channels  our ability to efficiently source and distribute products  changes in our merchandise mix  competition including competitive promotional activity and discount retailers  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the success of marketing programs  the cannibalization of existing store sales by our new stores  the benefits of closing underperforming stores in multi store markets  changes in catalog circulation and in our direct to customer business and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales because inclement weather can alter consumer behavior or require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors have caused our comparable store sales to fluctuate significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis and  as a result  we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future

the term of the lease automatically renews on an annual basis until these bonds are fully repaid in august the two partnerships described above qualify as variable interest entities due to their related party relationship to us and our obligation to renew the leases until the bonds are fully repaid 
accordingly  the two related party variable interest entity partnerships  from which we lease our memphis based distribution facilities  are consolidated by us 
as of january   our consolidated balance sheet includes  in assets primarily buildings   in debt and  in other long term liabilities related to these leases 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation or deflation on our results of operations for the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
in light of the current economic environment  however  we cannot be certain of the effect inflation or deflation may have on our results of our operations in the future 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
to determine if the value of our inventory should be marked down below cost  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
our inventory value is adjusted periodically to reflect current market conditions  which requires management judgments that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation  as well as gross margin 
the significant estimates used in inventory valuation are obsolescence including excess and slow moving inventory and lower of cost or market reserves and estimates of inventory shrinkage 
we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends  aging reports  specific identification and our estimates of future retail sales prices 
reserves for shrinkage are estimated and recorded throughout the year  at the concept and channel level  as a percentage of net sales based on historical shrinkage results  expectations of future shrinkage and current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count and can vary from our estimates due to such factors as changes in operations within our distribution centers  the mix of our inventory which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores  distribution centers  off site storage locations  and with our third party transportation providers 
accordingly  there is no remaining shrinkage reserve balance at year end 
due to these factors  our obsolescence and shrinkage reserves contain uncertainties 
both estimates have calculations that require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
if actual obsolescence or shrinkage estimates change from our original estimate  we will adjust our reserves accordingly throughout the year 
management does not believe that changes in the assumptions used in these estimates would have a significant effect on our inventory balances 
we have made no material changes to our assumptions included in the calculations of the obsolescence and shrinkage reserves throughout the year 
in addition  we do not believe a change in our inventory reserves would have a material effect on net earnings 
as of january  and february   our inventory obsolescence reserves were  and  respectively 
advertising and prepaid catalog expenses advertising expenses consist of media and production costs related to catalog mailings  e commerce advertising and other direct marketing activities 
all advertising costs are expensed as incurred  or upon the release of the initial advertisement  with the exception of prepaid catalog expenses 
prepaid catalog expenses consist primarily of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
estimated future revenues are based upon various factors such as the total number of catalogs and pages circulated  the probability and magnitude of consumer response and the assortment of merchandise offered 
each catalog is generally fully amortized over a six to nine month period  with the majority of the amortization occurring within the first four to five months 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability remaining net revenues less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog related costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment  primarily at a store level  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review for impairment all stores for which current or projected cash flows from operations are not sufficient to recover the 
table of contents carrying value of the assets 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the store lease term generally to years is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the future estimates of store profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  gross margin  employment rates  lease escalations  inflation on operating expenses and the overall economics of the retail industry and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the net carrying value and the asset s fair value 
long lived assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using level inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value is estimated based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate that is commensurate with the risk and approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
we recorded impairment charges related to our underperforming retail stores of   and  in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability claims 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
we determine our workers compensation liability and product and general liability claims reserves based on an actuarial analysis of historical claims data 
self insurance reserves for employee health benefits  workers compensation and product and general liability claims were  and  as of january  and february   respectively and are recorded within accrued salaries  benefits and other on our consolidated balance sheets 
customer deposits customer deposits are primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and merchandise credits and deferred revenue related to undelivered merchandise 
we maintain a liability for unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and merchandise credits until the earlier of redemption  escheatment or four years as we have concluded that the likelihood of our gift cards and gift certificates being redeemed beyond four years from the date of issuance is remote 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and the related cost of goods sold including shipping costs at the time the products are delivered to our customers 
revenue is recognized for retail sales excluding home delivered merchandise at the point of sale in the store and for home delivered merchandise and direct to customer sales when the merchandise is delivered to the customers 
discounts provided to customers are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns in each reporting period 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized as revenue at the time the products are delivered to the customer 
revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
sales return reserve our customers may return purchased items for an exchange or refund 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns  net of cost of goods sold  based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
as of january  and february   our reserve for sales returns was  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we measure and record compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all stock based awards using a fair value method 
for stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights option awards  fair value is determined using the black scholes valuation model  while restricted stock units are valued using 
table of contents the closing price of our stock on the date prior to the date of issuance 
significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised or cancelled 
the fair value of the award is amortized over the requisite service period 
total stock based compensation expense was   which includes an  reversal of compensation expense related to performance based stock awards  see note h and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and is recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of our earnings 
in accordance with the accounting for income taxes and uncertain tax positions  we make estimates regarding the likelihood that certain tax positions will be realized upon ultimate settlement and we record reserves where necessary 
it is reasonably possible that current income tax examinations involving uncertain tax positions could be resolved within the next months through administrative adjudicative procedures or settlement 
new accounting pronouncements in june  accounting standards codification asc topic consolidation  formerly statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r was issued 
this standard revises the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities and became effective for us on february  we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include significant deterioration of the us and foreign markets  changes in us interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  including the devaluation of the us dollar  and the effects of uncertain economic forces which may affect the prices we pay our vendors in the foreign countries in which we do business 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of january   we had two debt instruments with variable interest rates which subject us to risks associated with changes in interest rates  the interest payable on our credit facility and the bond related debt associated with one of our memphis based distribution facilities 
as of january   the total outstanding principal balance on these instruments was  with an interest rate of solely pertaining to our bond related debt associated with our memphis based distribution facilities 
if interest rates on these existing variable rate debt instruments rose  our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of january   our investments  made primarily in money market funds and highly liquid us treasury bills  are stated at cost and approximate their fair values 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars  however  only approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
any currency risks related to these international purchase transactions were not significant to us during fiscal and fiscal since we pay for the majority of our international purchases in us dollars  however  a decline in the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies would subject us to risks associated with increased purchasing costs from our vendors in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect these increased costs may have on our financial statements or results of operations 
in addition  as of january   we have retail stores in canada and limited sourcing operations in both europe and asia  each of which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
although these exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to us in the past  we may enter into foreign currency contracts in the future to minimize any currency remeasurement risk associated with the intercompany assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries 
we did not enter into any foreign currency contracts during fiscal or fiscal
