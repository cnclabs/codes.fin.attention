despite the economic challenges that negatively impacted fiscal and continue to impact our business  a strong second half to fiscal led to significant revenue and profit increases in fiscal over the prior year results 
our revenue growth was primarily attributable to sales generated from the acquisitions of cim in september and serviwrap in december the continued recovery in the automotive sector worldwide and protective products used in domestic infrastructure applications  as well as increased sales of specialty products and pipeline construction contributed to the increase in revenues over the prior year 
the revenue growth in fiscal is being partially offset by the negative impact of the weakened pound sterling and euro whose values against the dollar have decreased and  respectively  from august to august this past fiscal year we have been diligent in our efforts to consolidate and streamline our existing processes and related expenses 
as part of these efforts  we ceased operations at our paterson  nj plant in december and the products previously produced in that facility are now being produced in our webster  ma and taylorsville  nc plants 
in march  we closed our taunton  ma and albany  ny offices and consolidated those sales  research and development and administrative functions into our westwood  ma global operations center 
development of the property purchased in oxford  ma continues and the coatings plant in pittsburgh  pa is now fully operational

results of operations total revenues total revenues in fiscal increased  or to  from  in the prior year 
the increase in revenues in fiscal was primarily due to the following a sales of  from cim which we acquired in september  b increased sales of  from specialty and construction products  c increased sales of  in the electronic coatings product line from both the worldwide automotive sector and protective products used in domestic infrastructure applications  and d sales of  from serviwrap which was acquired in december these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of  in the transportation market

cost of products and services sold decreased  or to  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold increased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal the percentage of revenues increase in the cost of products and services sold was primarily due to decreased sales of our higher margin products and the resulting larger share of total sales that were made up of lower margin products  coupled with the impact of fixed manufacturing overhead costs on a lower revenue base 
these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of ongoing cost reduction efforts and continued focus on raw material costs through supply chain management 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or to  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat at in both fiscal and the dollar increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to incremental expenses from the cim and serviwrap acquisitions  including acquisition costs of  and amortization of intangible assets of  additionally  increased revenues and profitability in the current year compared to the prior year have led to increased sales commissions and other selling related expenses and increased incentive compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by our continued emphasis on controlling costs  including reduced travel and external consulting costs

bad debt expense  net of recoveries  increased  to  in fiscal compared to a net gain of  in fiscal that was due to recoveries of previously identified bad debt that exceeded additions to bad debt expense for the fiscal year 
this gain of  in fiscal compared to bad debt expense of  in fiscal the increase in bad debt expense in fiscal is primarily due to financial difficulties for several of our customers as well as overall increased receivable balances due to higher sales 
we continue to monitor these developments and maintain a strict adherence to our established credit policies as well as closely monitoring the accounts receivable function and taking a proactive approach to the collections process 
loss on impairment of goodwill in fiscal  based on the decrease in sales activity in the fiscal year and the completion of the fiscal budget  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our northeast quality products neqp division may not be recoverable 
accordingly  we performed a goodwill impairment analysis 
based on the present value of future cash flows utilizing projected results for the balance of fiscal year and projections for future years based on the fiscal year budgeting process  the goodwill impairment analysis yielded results that did not support the current book value of the goodwill associated with this division 
as a result  we concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill for the neqp division was not fully recoverable and an impairment charge of  was recorded as of may  goodwill related to neqp  having a pre impairment book value of  was written down to its fair value of  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the neqp division was sold on august   and the adjusted fair value of  was realized upon the sale

other income primarily includes bank interest and foreign exchange gains losses caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
the decrease in other income as compared to the prior year periods is primarily due to foreign exchange losses caused by the weakening of both the sterling and the euro 
additionally  we no longer receive rental income on previously owned real property sold in june income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
in all three years  we have received the benefit of the domestic production deduction and foreign rate differential 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to a less favorable foreign tax rate differential and research credit in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal compares favorably to due to a more favorable effective state income tax rate in net income consolidated net income in fiscal increased  or to  compared to  in fiscal income from continuing operations increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in net income from continuing operations in the current year is a result of the revenue growth discussed previously

income from discontinued operations decreased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in income from discontinued operations in fiscal was primarily a result of decreased customer orders and projects in this business as many of our key customers were assessing their inventory levels and closely monitoring their own customers demand during the economic downturn

cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by purchases of raw materials 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of august  compared to as of august  the decrease in our current ratio at august  was primarily attributable to the increase in the current portion of long term debt that was used to finance the cim and serviwrap acquisitions along with increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses

machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our other manufacturing plants 
we may consider the acquisition of companies or other assets this year or in future periods which are complementary to our business 
we believe that our existing resources  including cash on hand and our line of credit  together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings  will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that interest rates increase in future periods  we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions 
we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements

recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board s fasb approved the fasb accounting standards codification asc or the codification as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap 
the codification does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
all existing accounting standard documents will be superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the codification will be considered nonauthoritative 
the codification became effective for us in the quarter ending november  and the adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance under asc topic  business combinations asc 
the new guidance under asc establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  expenses acquisition related costs as incurred  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
we adopted the new guidance under asc as of september   and our recent acquisitions of cim and serviwrap were both accounted for under this standard 
in june  the fasb issued guidance within asc topic  earnings per share asc  to clarify that unvested share based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities 
the standard provides guidance on how to allocate earnings to participating securities and compute earnings per share using the two class method 
we adopted the provisions of this standard on september  and the disclosures required by asc have been made in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in december  the fasb issued asc topic  compensation retirement benefits asc 
asc provides additional guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other post retirement plan enabling users of the financial statements to assess the inputs and valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets at the annual reporting date 
the guidance requires more detailed disclosures about the assets of a defined benefit pension or other post retirement plan and is effective for fiscal years ending after december  since the guidance only requires enhanced disclosures  the adoption of asc did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance against amounts due to us is recorded  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
we estimate excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions and record reserves to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges 
business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets  using a variety of methods and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
the method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset  including a market participant s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
assets recorded from the perspective of a market participant that are determined to not have economic use for us are expensed immediately 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  trademarks  patents and agreements and property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
we review long lived assets and all 
table of contents intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
factors which we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we determine whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows and measure the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimates of expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of our obligation is complete  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting 
this is typically at the time of shipment 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment due to insolvent customers 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific customer contracts and shipment terms  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
commissions are recognized when earned and payments are received from the manufacturers represented 
royalty revenue is recognized based on licensee production statements received from the authorized manufacturers 
billed shipping and handling fees are recorded as sales revenue with the associated costs recorded as costs of products and services sold 
contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in the guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal the guidance prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our accounting for uncertain tax positions 
deferred income taxes we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for share based compensation at fair value  including estimated forfeitures  and recognize the expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which generally is the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options 
this model requires significant estimates related to the award s expected life and future stock price volatility of the underlying equity security 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we are also required to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the 
table of contents required service period 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
pension benefits we sponsor a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of certain divisions of the company 
in calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense  we make various assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions include discount rates  benefits earned  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension obligations and future expense 
effective december   the defined benefit pension plan was amended to include a soft freeze whereby any employee hired after the effective date of december  will not be admitted to the plan 
the only exception relates to employees of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union 
all participants who were previously admitted to the plan prior to the december  soft freeze will continue to accrue benefits as detailed in the plan agreements 
we account for our pension plan following the requirements of asc topic  compensation retirement benefits asc 
asc requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan  b measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions  and c recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant long term impact on our earnings 
in the event of significant inflation  our efforts to recover cost increases would be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate
