the following discussion of the company s services should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
bank services as a state chartered commercial bank  united security bank offers a full range of commercial banking services primarily to the business and professional community and individuals located in fresno  madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
the bank offers a wide range of deposit instruments including personal and business checking accounts and savings accounts  interest bearing negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market accounts and time certificates of deposit 
most of the bank s deposits are attracted from individuals and from small and medium sized business related sources 
the bank also engages in a full complement of lending activities  including real estate mortgage  commercial and industrial  real estate construction  as well as agricultural  lease financing  and consumer loans  with particular emphasis on short and medium term obligations 
the bank s loan portfolio is not concentrated in any one industry  although approximately of the bank s loans are secured by real estate 
a loan may be secured in whole or in part by real estate even though the purpose of the loan is not to facilitate the purchase or development of real estate 
at december   the bank had loans net of unearned fees outstanding of million  which represented approximately of the bank s total deposits and approximately of its total assets 
real estate mortgage loans are secured by deeds of trust primarily on commercial property 
repayment of real estate mortgage loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower 
commercial and industrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification 
loans may be originated in the company s market area  or participated with other financial institutions outside the company s market area 
a substantial portion of commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable  inventory  leases or other collateral 
the remainder are unsecured  however extensions of credit are predicated on the financial capacity of the borrower to repay the extension of credit 
repayment of commercial loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower 
real estate construction loans consist of loans to residential contractors  which are secured by single family residential properties 
all real estate loans have established equity requirements 
repayment of real estate construction loans is generally from long term mortgages with other lending institutions 
agricultural loans are generally secured by land  equipment  inventory and receivables 
repayment of agricultural loans is from the expected cash flow of the borrower 
in the normal course of business  the bank makes various loan commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities 
at december  and  loan commitments of the bank totaled million and million  respectively  and letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
of the million in loan commitments outstanding at december   million or were for loans with maturities of one year or less 
due to the nature of the business of the bank s customers  there are no seasonal patterns or absolute predictability to the utilization of unused loan commitments  therefore the bank is unable to forecast the extent to which these commitments will be exercised within the current year 
the bank does not believe that any such utilization will constitute a material liquidity demand 
the company does however have collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit which could be utilized if such loan commitments were to be exercised in excess of normal expectations 
in addition to the loan and deposit services discussed above  the bank also offers a wide range of specialized services designed to attract and service the needs of commercial customers and account holders 
these services include online banking  safe deposit boxes  atm services  payroll direct deposit  cashier s checks  traveler s checks  money orders  and foreign drafts 
in addition  the bank offers a variety of specialized financial services  including wealth management  employee benefit  insurance and loan products  as well as consulting services for a variety of clients 
the bank does not operate a trust department  however  it makes arrangements with its correspondent bank to offer trust services to its customers on request 
most of the bank s business originates within fresno  madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
neither the bank s business or liquidity is seasonal  and there has been no material effect upon the bank s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position as a result of federal  state or local environmental regulation 
competition and market share the banking business in california generally  and in the market area served by the company specifically  is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits 
the company competes for loans and deposits with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  money market funds  credit unions and other financial institutions  including a number that are substantially larger than the company 
deregulation of the banking industry  increased competition from non bank entities for the cash balances of individuals and businesses  and continuing developments in the computer and communications industries have had  and most likely will continue to have  a significant impact on the company s competitive position 
with the enactment of interstate banking legislation in california  bank holding companies headquartered outside of california will continue to enter the california market and provide competition for the company 
additionally  with the gramm leach bliley act of  traditional competitive barriers between insurance companies  securities underwriters  and commercial banks have been eased  allowing a greater number of financial intermediaries to offer a wider assortment of financial services 
many of the major commercial banks operating in the company s market areas offer certain services such as trust and international banking services  which the company does not offer directly 
in addition  banks with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve larger customers 
the company s primary market area at december  was located in fresno  madera  and kern counties  in which approximately fdic insured financial institutions compete for business 
santa clara county was added during february with the legacy bank acquisition  in which approximately fdic insured financial institutions compete for business 
the following table sets forth information regarding deposit market share and ranking by county as of june   which is the most current information available 
rank share fresno county th madera county th kern county th total of fresno  madera  kern counties th santa clara county th supervision and regulation the company the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhc act  and is registered as such with the frb 
a bank holding company is required to file with the frb annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries and is also subject to examination by the frb 
the bhc act requires  among other things  prior approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock of that bank 
the bhc act also provides that the frb shall not approve any acquisition that would result in or further the creation of a monopoly  or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition  unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the probable effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the community served 
furthermore  under the bhc act  a bank holding company is  with limited exceptions  prohibited from i acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or ii engaging in any activity other than managing or controlling banks 
with the prior approval of the frb  however  a bank holding company may own shares of a company engaged in activities which the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto 
amendments to the bhc act expand the circumstances under which a bank holding company may acquire control of all or substantially all of the assets of a bank located outside the state of california 
the bhc act requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks 
it is the frb s policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting a subsidiary bank 
under certain conditions  the frb may conclude that certain actions of a bank holding company  such as payment of cash dividends  would constitute unsafe and unsound banking practices because they violate the frb s source of strength doctrine 
a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
for example  with certain exceptions  a bank may not condition an extension of credit on a promise by its customer to obtain other services by it  its holding company or other subsidiaries  or on a promise by its customer not to obtain services from a competitor 
in addition  federal law imposes certain restrictions between the company and its subsidiaries  including the bank 
as an affiliate of the bank  the company is subject  with certain exceptions  to provisions of federal law imposing limitations on  and requiring collateral for  extensions of credit by the bank to its affiliates 
as a public company  united security bancshares is subject to the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act amends the securities and exchange act of  and is intended to protect investors by  among other things  improving the reliability of financial reporting  increasing management accountability  and increasing the independence of directors and the company s external accountants

the bank the bank as a state chartered bank is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the california department of financial institutions 
in addition  the bank is also a member of the federal reserve system and  as such  is subject to applicable provisions of the federal reserve act and regulations issued thereunder and  is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the federal reserve bank 
the bank is subject to california law  insofar as they are not preempted by federal banking law 
deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic up to the applicable limits in an amount up to  per customer  and  as such  the bank is subject to the regulations of the fdic and the federal deposit insurance act 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in california and the united states  the bank s business is particularly susceptible to changes in california and federal legislation and regulation  which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting permissible activities or increasing competition 
various other requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states and the state of california affect the operations of the bank 
federal and california statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including capital requirements and disclosure requirements to depositors and borrowers  requirements to maintain reserves against deposits  limitations on interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  and restrictions on borrowings and on payment of dividends 
the dfi regulates the number and location of branch offices of a state chartered bank  and may permit a bank to maintain branches only to the extent allowable under state law for state banks 
california law presently permits a bank to locate a branch in any locality in the state 
additionally  california law exempts banks from california usury laws 
capital standards 
the frb has risk based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are reported as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us government securities  to for assets with relatively higher credit risk  such as business loans 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
the regulators measure risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items against both total qualifying capital the sum of tier capital and limited amounts of tier capital and tier capital 
tier capital consists of common stock  retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries  less most other intangible assets 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity 
the inclusion of elements of tier capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies 
since december   the frb and the fdic have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of  and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  the frb requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to average total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
it is improbable  however  that an institution with a leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators ratings 
for all banking organizations not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio is at least to basis points above the minimum 
thus  the effective minimum leverage ratio  for all practical purposes  is at least or 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the frb and fdic have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
a bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the fdic to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels 
as discussed above  we are required to maintain certain levels of capital  as is the bank 
the regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the bank and the company as of december  follow requirement for the bank to be adequately capitalized well capitalized company bank tier leverage capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio prompt corrective action 
federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios described above 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver  the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a depository institution  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
additionally  a holding company s inability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banking organizations could serve as an additional basis for a regulatory action against the holding company 
premiums for deposit insurance 
the deposit insurance fund of the fdic insures our customer deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of and the federal deposit insurance reform conforming amendments act of amended the insurance of deposits by the fdic and collection of assessments from insured depository institutions for deposit insurance 
the fdic approved a final rule in and amended the rule in february that sets an insured depository institution s assessment rate on different factors that pose a risk of loss to the deposit insurance fund  including the institution s recent financial ratios and supervisory ratings  and level of reliance on a significant amount of secured liabilities or significant amount of brokered deposits except that the factor of brokered deposits will not be considered for well capitalized institutions that are not accompanied by rapid growth 
the fdic also in february set the assessment base rates to range between to per of insured deposits on an annual basis 
in may  the fdic imposed a special assessment of basis points on each insured depository institution s assets less its tier capital payable on september  with a ceiling of basis points of an institution s domestic deposits 
in november  the fdic approved a final rule to require all insured depository institutions including the bank to prepay three years of fdic assessments in the fourth quarter of  except in the event such prepayment is waived by the fdic 
the prepayment provision was waived for the bank by the fdic 
although the bank was exempted from the three year prepayment assessment  amounts paid and expensed for the quarterly fdic insurance assessment increased significantly during and may reduce the cash and liquidity of the bank in subsequent periods 
due to the significant losses at failed banks and expected losses for banks that will fail  it is likely that fdic insurance fund assessments on the bank will increase  and such assessments may materially adversely affect the profitability of the bank 
any increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  depending on the amount of the increase 
furthermore  the fdic is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for the bank would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of san francisco the fhlb sf 
among other benefits  each federal home loan bank fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
the fhlb sf utilizes a single class of stock with a par value of per share  which may be issued  exchanged  redeemed and repurchased only at par value 
as an fhlb member  the bank is required to own fhlb sf capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of million of membership asset value as defined  or an activity based stock requirement based on percentage of outstanding advances 
the fhlb sf capital stock is redeemable on five years written notice  subject to certain conditions 
at december  the bank owned  shares of the fhlb sf capital stock 
federal reserve 
the frb requires all depository institutions to maintain non interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts and non personal time deposits 
at december   we were in compliance with these requirements 
regulatory action effective march   united security bancshares the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  united security bank the bank  entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
under the terms of the agreement  the company and the bank agreed  among other things  to strengthen board oversight of management and the bank s operations  submit an enhanced written plan to strengthen credit risk management practices and improve the bank s position on the past due loans  classified loans  and other real estate owned  maintain a sound process for determining  documenting  and recording an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  improve the management of the bank s liquidity position and funds management policies  maintain sufficient capital at the company and bank level  and improve the bank s earnings and overall condition 
the company and bank have also agreed not to increase or guarantee any debt  purchase or redeem any shares of stock  declare or pay any cash dividends  or pay interest on the company s junior subordinated debt or trust preferred securities  without prior written approval from the federal reserve bank 
this agreement was a result of a regulatory examination that was conducted by the federal reserve and the california department of financial institutions in june  and relates primarily to the bank s asset quality 
progress on these items has been made since the completion of the examination and management and the board are committed to resolving all of the items addressed by the federal reserve in the agreement 
both the company and the bank will submit quarterly written progress reports to the federal reserve bank 
the company and the bank have also received notification from the california department of financial institutions of their intention to issue a regulatory order as a result of the june regulatory examination 
the company and the bank have not yet entered into an agreement with the california department of financial institutions  but believe that any agreement entered into  will be similar to the current agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
effect of governmental policies and recent legislation banking has traditionally been a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the company on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans extended to its customers and securities held in the company s portfolio comprise the major portion of the company s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including  but not limited to  inflation  recession and unemployment 
impact of monetary policies 
the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve board frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements  and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks which are members of the federal reserve system 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the frb s policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies are not predictable 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting the company s net income 
extensions of credit to insiders and transactions with affiliates 
the federal reserve act and frb regulation o place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank s or bank holding company s executive officers  directors and principal shareholders ie  in most cases  those persons who own  control or have power to vote more than of any class of voting securities  any company controlled by any such executive officer  director or shareholder  or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer  director or principal shareholder 
loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with loan to one borrower limits  require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts  must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non insiders  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
in addition  regulation o provides that the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a bank as a group cannot exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
regulation o also prohibits a bank from paying an overdraft on an account of an executive officer or director  except pursuant to a written pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre authorized transfer of funds from another account of the officer or director at the bank 
consumer protection laws and regulations 
the banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature  and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations 
the company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations  some of which are discussed below 
the community reinvestment act the cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess a bank s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
the agencies use the cra assessment factors in order to provide a rating to the financial institution 
the ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
in its last examination for cra compliance  as of august  the bank was rated satisfactory 
the equal credit opportunity act the ecoa generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
the truth in lending act the tila is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments  including the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total of payments and the payment schedule  among other things 
the fair housing act the fh act regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing related lending activities against any person because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
a number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
the home mortgage disclosure act the hmda  in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods  requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
the hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
the right to financial privacy act the rfpa imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers 
financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy  and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties 
finally  the real estate settlement procedures act the respa requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines  reimbursement and other penalties 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with cra  ecoa  tila  fh act  hmda  rfpa and respa generally  the company may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local communities 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood of any major change and the impact such change may have on the company is impossible to predict 
certain of the potentially significant changes which have been enacted recently and other which are currently under consideration by congress or various regulatory agencies or professional agencies are discussed below 
recent legislation and other changes federal and state laws affecting banking are enacted from time to time  and similarly federal and state regulations affecting banking are also adopted from time to time 
the following include some of the recent laws and regulations affecting banking 
in may the helping families save their homes act of was enacted to help consumers avoid mortgage foreclosures on their homes through certain loss mitigation actions including special forbearance  loan modification  pre foreclosure sale  deed in lieu of foreclosure  support for borrower housing counseling  subordinate lien resolution  and borrower relocation 
the new law permits the secretary of housing and urban development hud  for mortgages either in default or facing imminent default  to authorize the modification of such mortgages  and establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee who agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a to family residence 
in implementing the law  the secretary of hud is authorized to provide compensation to the mortgagee for lost income on monthly mortgage payments due to interest rate reduction  reimburse the mortgagee from a guaranty fund in connection with activities that the mortgagee is required to undertake concerning repayment by the mortgagor of the amount owed to hud  make payments to the mortgagee on behalf of the borrower  under terms defined by hud  and make mortgage modification with terms extended up to years from the modification date 
the new law also authorizes the secretary of hud to reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee  act as a government national mortgage association gnma  or ginnie mae issuer  or contract with an entity for such purpose  in order to pool the mortgage into a ginnie mae security  or resell the mortgage in accordance with any program established for purchase by the federal government of insured mortgages 
the new law also amends the foreclosure prevention act of  with respect to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes neighborhood stabilization  to authorize each state that has received certain minimum allocations and has fulfilled certain requirements  to distribute any remaining amounts to areas with homeowners at risk of foreclosure or in foreclosure without regard to the percentage of home foreclosures in such areas 
also in may  the credit card act of was enacted to help consumers and ban certain practices of credit card issuers 
the new law allows interest rate hikes on existing balances only under limited conditions  such as when a promotional rate ends  there is a variable rate or if the cardholder makes a late payment 
interest rates on new transactions can increase only after the first year 
significant changes in terms on accounts cannot occur without days advance notice of the change 
the new law bans raising interest rates on customers based on their payment records with other unrelated credit issuers such as utility companies and other creditors for existing credit card balances  though card issuers would still be allowed to use universal default on future credit card balances if they give at least days advance notice of the change 
the new law allows consumers to opt out of certain significant changes in terms on their accounts 
opting out means cardholders agree to close their accounts and pay off the balance under the old terms 
they have at least five years to pay the balance 
credit card issuers will be banned from issuing credit cards to anyone under  unless they have adult co signers on the accounts or can show proof they have enough income to repay the card debt 
credit card companies must stay at least  feet from college campuses if they are offering free pizza or other gifts to entice students to apply for credit cards 
the new law requires card issuers to give card account holders a reasonable amount of time to make payments on monthly bills 
that means payments would be due at least days after they are mailed or delivered 
credit card issuers would no longer be able to set early morning or other arbitrary deadlines for payments 
when consumers have accounts that carry different interest rates for different types of purchases payments in excess of the minimum amount due must go to balances with higher interest rates first 
consumers must opt in to over limit fees 
those who opt out would have their transactions rejected if they exceed their credit limits  thus avoiding over limit fees 
fees charged for going over the limit must be reasonable 
finance charges on outstanding credit card balances would be computed based on purchases made in the current cycle rather than going back to the previous billing cycle to calculate interest charges 
fees on credit cards cannot exceed percent of the available credit limit in the first year of the card 
credit card issuers must disclose to cardholders the consequences of making only minimum payments each month  namely how long it would take to pay off the entire balance if users only made the minimum monthly payment 
issuers must also provide information on how much users must pay each month if they want to pay off their balances in months  including the amount of interest 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was enacted to provide stimulus to the struggling us economy 
arra authorizes spending of billion  including about billion for tax relief  billion for state and local relief aid  and billion for infrastructure and science

in addition  the board of directors of any tarp recipient is required under eesa  as amended to have a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  as identified by the treasury  which may include excessive expenditures on entertainment or events  office and facility renovations  aviation or other transportation services  or other activities or events that are not reasonable expenditures for staff development  reasonable performance incentives  or other similar measures conducted in the normal course of the business operations of the tarp recipient 
eesa  as amended by arra  provides for a new incentive compensation restriction for financial institutions receiving tarp funds 
the number of executives and employees covered by this new incentive compensation restriction depends on the amount of tarp funds received by such entity 
for community banks that have or will receive less than million  the new incentive compensation restriction applies only to the highest paid employee 
this new incentive compensation restriction prohibits a tarp recipient from paying or accruing any bonus  retention award  or incentive compensation during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding  except that such prohibition shall not apply to the payment of long term restricted stock by such tarp recipient  provided that such long term restricted stock i does not fully vest during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding  ii has a value in an amount that is not greater than of the total amount of annual compensation of the employee receiving the stock  and iii is subject to such other terms and conditions as the secretary of the treasury may determine is in the public interest 
in addition  this prohibition does not prohibit any bonus payment required to be paid pursuant to a written employment contract executed on or before february   as such valid employment contracts are determined by the treasury 
eesa was amended by arra to also provide additional corporate governance provisions with respect to executive compensation including the following establishment of standards during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding  each tarp recipient shall be subject to the standards in the regulations issued by the treasury with respect to executive compensation limitations for tarp recipients  and the provisions of section m of the internal revenue code of  as applicable nondeductibility of executive compensation in excess of compliance with standards the treasury is required to see that each tarp recipient meet the required standards for executive compensation and corporate governance 
specific requirements for the required standards limits on compensation that exclude incentives for senior executive officers of the tarp recipient to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding 
a clawback requirement by such tarp recipient of any bonus  retention award  or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive officer and any of the next most highly compensated employees of the tarp recipient based on statements of earnings  revenues  gains  or other criteria that are later found to be materially inaccurate 
a prohibition on such tarp recipient making any golden parachute payment to a senior executive officer or any of the next most highly compensated employees of the tarp recipient during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding 
a prohibition on any compensation plan that would encourage manipulation of the reported earnings of such tarp recipient to enhance the compensation of any of its employees 
a requirement for the establishment of an independent compensation committee that meets at least twice a year to discuss and evaluate employee compensation plans in light of an assessment of any risk posed to the tarp recipient from such plans 
for a non sec company that is a tarp recipient that has received  or less of tarp assistance  the duties of the compensation committee may be carried out by the board of directors of such tarp recipient 
in addition  eesa as amended by arra provides that for any tarp recipient  its annual meeting materials shall include a nonbinding shareholder approval proposal of executive compensation for shareholders to vote 
the sec is to establish regulations to implement this provision 
while nonpublic companies are required to include this proposal  it is not known what the regulations will provide as to executive compensation disclosure requirements of such tarp recipients  and whether they will be as extensive as the existing sec executive compensation requirements 
in addition  shareholders are allowed to present other nonbinding proposals with respect to executive compensation 
arra also provides million to the sba and makes changes to the agency s lending and investment programs so that they can reach more small businesses that need help 
the funding includes million for temporarily eliminating fees on sba backed loans and raising sba s guarantee percentage on some loans to percent 
million for a new loan program to help small businesses meet existing debt payments million for expanding sba s microloan program  enough to finance up to million in new lending and million in technical assistance grants to microlenders 
on february   the u 
s 
treasury  the federal reserve board  the fdic  the office of the comptroller of the currency  and the office of thrift supervision all announced a comprehensive set of measures to restore confidence in the strength of us financial institutions and restart the critical flow of credit to households and businesses 
this program is intended to restore the flows of credit necessary to support recovery 
the core program elements include a new capital assistance program to help ensure that our banking institutions have sufficient capital to withstand the challenges ahead  paired with a supervisory process to produce a more consistent and forward looking assessment of the risks on banks balance sheets and their potential capital needs 
a new public private investment fund on an initial scale of up to billion  with the potential to expand up to trillion  to catalyze the removal of legacy assets from the balance sheets of financial institutions 
this fund will combine public and private capital with government financing to help free up capital to support new lending 
a new treasury and federal reserve initiative to dramatically expand up to trillion the existing term asset backed securities lending facility talf in order to reduce credit spreads and restart the securitized credit markets that in recent years supported a substantial portion of lending to households  students  small businesses  and others 
an extension of the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program to october  a new framework of governance and oversight to help ensure that banks receiving funds are held responsible for appropriate use of those funds through stronger conditions on lending  dividends and executive compensation along with enhanced reporting to the public 
in october  the president signed the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  in response to the global financial crisis of authorizing the united states secretary of the treasury with authority to spend up to billion to purchase distressed assets  especially mortgage backed securities  under the troubled assets relief program tarp and make capital injections into banks under the capital purchase program 
eesa gives the government the unprecedented authority to buy troubled assets on balance sheets of financial institutions under the troubled assets relief program and increases the limit on insured deposits from  to  through december  some of the other provisions of eesa are as follows accelerated from to the date that the federal reserve bank could pay interest on deposits of banks held with the federal reserve to meet reserve requirements  to the extent that the u 
s 
treasury purchases mortgage securities as part of tarp  the treasury shall implement a plan to minimize foreclosures including using guarantees and credit enhancements to support reasonable loan modifications  and to the extent loans are owned by the government to consent to the reasonable modification of such loans  limits executive compensation for executives for tarp participating financial institutions including a maximum corporate tax deduction limit of  for each of the top five highest paid executives of such institution  requiring clawbacks of incentive compensation that were paid based on inaccurate or false information  limiting golden parachutes for involuntary and certain voluntary terminations to x their average annual salary and bonus for the last five years  and prohibiting the payment of incentive compensation that encourages management to take unnecessary and excessive risks with respect to the institution  extends the mortgage debt forgiveness provision of the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of by three years to ease the income tax burden on those involved with certain foreclosures  and qualified financial institutions may count losses on fnma and fhlmc preferred stock against ordinary income  rather than capital gain income 
on february   the treasury secretary announced a new comprehensive financial stability legislation the financial stability plan  which earmarked the second billion of unused funds originally authorized under the eesa 
the major elements of the financial stability plan included i a capital assistance program that has invested in convertible preferred stock of certain qualifying institutions  ii a consumer and business lending initiative to fund new consumer loans  small business loans and commercial mortgage asset backed securities issuances  iii a public private investment fund intended to leverage public and private capital with public financing to purchase up to billion to trillion of legacy toxic assets from financial institutions  and iv assistance for homeowners by providing up to billion to reduce mortgage payments and interest rates and establishing loan modification guidelines for government and private programs 
on october   the federal reserve board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
the proposal  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governance  including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors 
the proposal also contemplates a detailed review by the federal reserve board of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large  complex banking organizations 
any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings  which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions 
in addition  the proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 
similarly  on january   the fdic announced that it would seek public comment through advance notice of rule making on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged at higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged 
on september   the us treasury issued a policy statement entitled principles for reforming the us and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms 
the statement was developed in consultation with the us bank regulatory agencies and sets forth eight core principles intended to shape a new international capital accord 
six of the core principles relate directly to bank capital requirements 
the statement contemplates changes to the existing regulatory capital regime that would involve substantial revisions to  if not replacement of  major parts of the basel i and basel ii and affect all regulated banking organizations and other systemically important institutions 
the statement calls for higher and stronger capital requirements for bank and non bank financial firms that are deemed to pose a risk to financial stability due to their combination of size  leverage  interconnectedness and liquidity risk 
the statement suggested that changes to the regulatory capital framework be phased in over a period of several years with a recommended schedule providing for a comprehensive international agreement by december   with the implementation of reforms by december   although it does remain possible that us bank regulatory agencies could officially adopt  or informally implement  new capital standards at an earlier date 
following the issuance of the statement  on december   the basel committee issued a set of proposals the capital proposals that would significantly revise the definitions of tier capital and tier capital  with the most significant changes being to tier capital 
most notably  the capital proposals would disqualify certain structured capital instruments  such as trust preferred securities  from tier capital status 
the capital proposals would also re emphasize that common equity is the predominant component of tier capital by adding a minimum common equity to risk weighted assets ratio and requiring that goodwill  general intangibles and certain other items that currently must be deducted from tier capital instead be deducted from common equity as a component of tier capital 
the capital proposals also leave open the possibility that the basel committee will recommend changes to the minimum tier capital and total capital ratios of and  respectively 
concurrently with the release of the capital proposals  the basel committee also released a set of proposals related to liquidity risk exposure the liquidity proposals 
the liquidity proposals have three key elements  including the implementation of i a liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered  high quality assets sufficient to meet the bank s liquidity needs over a day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon  and iii a set of monitoring tools that the basel committee indicates should be considered as the minimum types of information that banks should report to supervisors and that supervisors should use in monitoring the liquidity risk profiles of supervised entities 
in june  the administration proposed a wide range of regulatory reforms that  if enacted  may have significant effects on the financial services industry in the united states 
significant aspects of the administration s proposals included  among other things  proposals i that any financial firm whose combination of size  leverage and interconnectedness could pose a threat to financial stability be subject to certain enhanced regulatory requirements  ii that federal bank regulators require loan originators or sponsors to retain part of the credit risk of securitized exposures  iii that there be increased regulation of broker dealers and investment advisers  iv for the creation of a federal consumer financial protection agency that would  among other things  be charged with applying consistent regulations to similar products such as imposing certain notice and consent requirements on consumer overdraft lines of credit  v that there be comprehensive regulation of otc derivatives  vi that the controls on the ability of banking institutions to engage in transactions with affiliates be tightened  and vii that financial holding companies be required to be well capitalized and well managed on a consolidated basis 
the congress  state lawmaking bodies and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to consider a number of wide ranging and comprehensive proposals for altering the structure  regulation and competitive relationships of the nation s financial institutions  including rules and regulations related to the broad range of reform proposals set forth by the obama administration described above 
along with amendments to the administration s proposal there are separate comprehensive financial reform bills intended to address in part or whole or vary in part or in whole from the proposals set forth by the administration were introduced in both houses of congress in the second half of and in and remain under review by both the us house of representatives and the us senate 
the temporary liquidity guarantee program was implemented by the fdic on october  to mitigate the lack of liquidity in the financial markets 
the temporary liquidity guarantee program has two primary components the debt guarantee program  by which the fdic will guarantee the payment of certain newly issued senior unsecured debt  and the transaction account guarantee program  by which the fdic will guarantee certain noninterest bearing and low interest bearing transaction accounts 
the debt guarantee program provides for an fdic guarantee as to the payment of all senior unsecured debt with a term of more than days issued by a qualified participating entity insured depository institutions  bank and financial holding companies  and certain savings and loan holding companies up to a limit of percent of all senior unsecured debt outstanding on september   and maturing by june  the fdic guarantee is until june   and the fee for such guarantee depends on the term with a maximum of basis points for terms in excess of days 
the transaction account guarantee program is the second part of the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the fdic provides for a temporary full guarantee held at a participating fdic insured depository institution of noninterest bearing and low interest bearing transaction accounts above the existing deposit insurance limit at the additional cost of basis points per annum 
this coverage became effective on october   and would continue through december  on july   the housing and economic recovery act was signed the president 
it authorizes the federal housing administration to guarantee up to billion in new year fixed rate mortgages for subprime borrowers if lenders write down principal loan balances to percent of current appraisal value 
it is also intended to restore confidence in fannie mae and freddie mac by strengthening regulations and injecting capital into them 
states will be authorized to refinance subprime loans using mortgage revenue bonds 
it also establishes the federal housing finance agency out of the federal housing finance board and office of federal housing enterprise oversight 
in  the federal reserve board  the fdic  the office of the comptroller of the currency  and the office of thrift supervision amended their regulatory capital rules to permit banks  bank holding companies  and savings associations as to any of these a financial institution to reduce the amount of goodwill that a banking organization must deduct from tier capital by the amount of any deferred tax liability associated with that goodwill 
however  a financial institution that reduces the amount of goodwill deducted from tier capital by the amount of the deferred tax liability is not permitted to net this deferred tax liability against deferred tax assets when determining regulatory capital limitations on deferred tax assets 
for these financial institutions  the amount of goodwill deducted from tier capital will reflect each institution s maximum exposure to loss in the event that the entire amount of goodwill is impaired or derecognized  an event which triggers the concurrent derecognition of the related deferred tax liability for financial reporting purposes 
on october  the fdic adopted a restoration plan that would increase the rates banks pay for deposit insurance  and proposed rules for adjusting the system that determines what deposit insurance premium rate a bank pays the fdic 
currently  banks pay anywhere from five basis points to basis points for deposit insurance 
under the proposal rule  the assessment rate schedule would be raised uniformly by basis points annualized beginning on january  beginning with the second quarter of  changes would be made to the deposit insurance assessment system to make the increase in assessments fairer by requiring riskier institutions to pay a larger share 
together  the proposed changes would improve the way the system differentiates risk among insured institutions and help ensure that the reserve ratio returns to at least percent by the end of the proposed changes to the assessment system include assessing higher rates to institutions with a significant reliance on secured liabilities  which generally raises the fdic s loss in the event of failure without providing additional assessment revenue 
the proposal also would assess higher rates for institutions with a significant reliance on brokered deposits but  for well managed and well capitalized institutions  only when accompanied by rapid asset growth 
brokered deposits combined with rapid asset growth have played a role in a number of costly failures  including some recent ones 
the proposal also would provide incentives in the form of a reduction in assessment rates for institutions to hold long term unsecured debt and  for smaller institutions  high levels of tier capital 
the fdic also voted to maintain the designated reserve ratio at percent as a signal of its long term target for the fund 
the federal reserve board in october approved final amendments to regulation c that revise the rules for reporting price information on higher priced mortgage loans 
the changes are intended to improve the accuracy and usefulness of data reported under the home mortgage disclosure act 
regulation c currently requires lenders to collect and report the spread between the annual percentage rate apr on a mortgage loan and the yield on a treasury security of comparable maturity if the spread is greater than percentage points for a first lien loan or greater than percentage points for a subordinate lien loan 
this difference is known as a rate spread 
under the final rule  a lender will report the spread between the loan s apr and a survey based estimate of aprs currently offered on prime mortgages of a comparable type average prime offer rate if the spread is equal to or greater than percentage points for a first lien loan or equal to or greater than percentage points for a subordinate lien loan 
the board will publish average prime offer rates based on the primary mortgage market survey currently published by freddie mac 
in setting the rate spread reporting threshold  the board sought to cover subprime mortgages and generally avoid covering prime mortgages 
the changes to regulation c conform the threshold for rate spread reporting to the definition of higher priced mortgage loans adopted by the board under regulation z truth in lending in july of the federal reserve board in july approved a final rule for home mortgage loans to better protect consumers and facilitate responsible lending 
the rule prohibits unfair  abusive or deceptive home mortgage lending practices and restricts certain other mortgage practices 
the final rule also establishes advertising standards and requires certain mortgage disclosures to be given to consumers earlier in the transaction 
the final rule  which amends regulation z truth in lending and was adopted under the home ownership and equity protection act hoepa  largely follows a proposal released by the board in december  with enhancements that address ensuing public comments  consumer testing  and further analysis 
the final rule adds four key protections for a newly defined category of higher priced mortgage loans secured by a consumer s principal dwelling 
for loans in this category  these protections will prohibit a lender from making a loan without regard to borrowers ability to repay the loan from income and assets other than the home s value 
a lender complies  in part  by assessing repayment ability based on the highest scheduled payment in the first seven years of the loan 
to show that a lender violated this prohibition  a borrower does not need to demonstrate that it is part of a pattern or practice 
require creditors to verify the income and assets they rely upon to determine repayment ability 
ban any prepayment penalty if the payment can change in the initial four years 
for other higher priced loans  a prepayment penalty period cannot last for more than two years 
require creditors to establish escrow accounts for property taxes and homeowner s insurance for all first lien mortgage loans 
in addition to the rules governing higher priced loans  the rules adopt the following protections for loans secured by a consumer s principal dwelling  regardless of whether the loan is higher priced creditors and mortgage brokers are prohibited from coercing a real estate appraiser to misstate a home s value 
companies that service mortgage loans are prohibited from engaging in certain practices  such as pyramiding late fees 
in addition  servicers are required to credit consumers loan payments as of the date of receipt and provide a payoff statement within a reasonable time of request 
creditors must provide a good faith estimate of the loan costs  including a schedule of payments  within three days after a consumer applies for any mortgage loan secured by a consumer s principal dwelling  such as a home improvement loan or a loan to refinance an existing loan 
currently  early cost estimates are only required for home purchase loans 
consumers cannot be charged any fee until after they receive the early disclosures  except a reasonable fee for obtaining the consumer s credit history 
for all mortgages  the rule also sets additional advertising standards 
advertising rules now require additional information about rates  monthly payments  and other loan features 
the final rule bans seven deceptive or misleading advertising practices  including representing that a rate or payment is fixed when it can change 
the rule s definition of higher priced mortgage loans will capture virtually all loans in the subprime market  but generally exclude loans in the prime market 
to provide an index  the federal reserve board will publish the average prime offer rate  based on a survey currently published by freddie mac 
a loan is higher priced if it is a first lien mortgage and has an annual percentage rate that is percentage points or more above this index  or percentage points if it is a subordinate lien mortgage 
the new rules take effect on october  the single exception is the escrow requirement  which will be phased in during to allow lenders to establish new systems as needed 
in california  the enactment of ab in  the reverse mortgage elder protection act of prohibits a lender or any other person who participates in the origination of the mortgage from participation in  being associated with  or employing any party that participates in or is associated with any other financial or insurance activity or referring a prospective borrower to anyone for the purchase of other financial or insurance products  and imposes certain disclosure requirements on the lender 
the enactment of ab in  requires a supervised financial institution in california that negotiates primarily in any of a number of specified languages in the course of entering into a contract or agreement for a loan or extension of credit secured by residential real property  to deliver  prior to the execution of the contract or agreement  and no later than business days after receiving the written application  a specified form in that language summarizing the terms of the contract or agreement  provides for administrative penalties for violations  and requires the california department of corporations and the department of financial institutions to create a form for providing translations and make it available in spanish  chinese  tagalog  vietnamese and korean 
the statute becomes operative on july   or days after issuance of the form  whichever occurs later 
the enactment of ab in makes changes to the california unclaimed property law including among other things allowing electronic notification to customers who have consented to electronic notice  requiring that notices contain certain information and allow the holder to provide electronic means to enable the owner to contact the holder in lieu of returning the prescribed form to declare the owner s intent  authorizing the holder to give additional notices  and requiring  beginning january   a banking or financial organization to provide a written notice regarding escheat at the time a new account or safe deposit box is opened 
the enactment of sb makes specified changes to clarify existing law related to filing a notice of default on residential real property in california  including among other things clarifying that the provisions apply to mortgages and deeds of trust recorded from january  through december   secured by owner occupied residential real property containing no more than dwelling units  revising the declaration to be filed with the notice of default  specifying how the loan servicers have to maximize net present value under their pooling and servicing agreements applies to certain investors  specifying how and when the notice to residents of property subject to foreclosure is to be mailed  and extending the time during which the notice of sale must be recorded from to days 
the bill also makes certain changes related to short pay agreements and short pay demand statements 
on february   governor schwarzenegger signed abx and sbx  which established the california foreclosure prevention act 
the california foreclosure prevention act modifies the foreclosure process to provide additional time for borrowers to work out loan modifications while providing an exemption for mortgage loan servicers that have implemented a comprehensive loan modification program 
civil code section requires an additional day period beyond the period already provided before a notice of sale can be given in order to allow all parties to pursue a loan modification to prevent foreclosure of loans meeting certain criteria identified in that section 
a mortgage loan servicer who has implemented a comprehensive loan modification program may file an application for exemption from the provisions of civil code section 
approval of this application provides the mortgage loan servicer an exemption from the additional day period before filing the notice of sale when foreclosing on real property covered by the new law 
california assembly bill was signed by the governor on july  and became law on january  among other things  the bill eliminated unnecessary applications that consume time and resources of bank licensees and which in many cases are now perfunctory 
all of current article locations of head office of chapter  and all of chapter branch offices  other places of business and automated teller machines were repealed 
a new chapter bank offices was added 
the new chapter requires notice to the california department of financial institutions dfi the establishment of offices  rather than the current application process 
many of the current branch applications are perfunctory in nature and or provide for a waiver of application 
banks  on an exception basis  may be subject to more stringent requirements as deemed necessary 
as an example  new banks  banks undergoing a change in ownership and banks in less than satisfactory condition may be required to obtain prior approval from the dfi before establishing offices if such activity is deemed to create an issue of safety and soundness 
the bill eliminated unnecessary provisions in the banking law that are either outdated or have become undue restrictions to bank licensees 
chapter powers and miscellaneous provisions was repealed 
a new chapter restrictions and prohibited practices was added 
this chapter brings together restrictions in bank activities as formerly found in chapter prohibited practices and penalties 
however  in bringing the restrictions into the new chapter  various provisions were updated to remove the need for prior approval by the dfi commissioner 
the bill renumbered current banking law sections to align like sections 
chapter authorizations for banks was added 
the purpose of the chapter is to provide exceptions to certain activities that would otherwise be prohibited by other laws outside of the financial code 
the bill added article loan and investment limitations to chapter commercial banks 
this article is new in concept and acknowledges that investment decisions are business decisions so long as there is a diversification of the investments to spread any risk 
the risk is diversified in this article by placing a limitation on the loans and investments that can be made to any one entity 
this section is a trade off for elimination of applications to the dfi for approval of investments in securities  which were repealed 
other changes ab made to the banking law authorized a bank or trust acting in any capacity under a court or private trust to arrange for the deposit of securities in a securities depository or federal reserve bank  and provided how they may be held by the securities depository  reduced from to the amount of eligible assets to be maintained at an approved depository by an office of a foreign other nation bank for the protection of the interests of creditors of the bank s business in this state or for the protection of the public interest  enabled the dfi to issue an order against a bank licensee parent or subsidiary  provided that the examinations may be conducted in alternate examination periods if the dfi concludes that an examination of the state bank by the appropriate federal regulator carries out the purpose of this section  but the dfi may not accept two consecutive examination reports made by federal regulators  provided that the dfi may examine subsidiaries of every california state bank  state trust company  and foreign other nation bank to the extent and whenever and as often as the dfi shall deem advisable  enabled the dfi issue an order or a final order to now include any bank holding company or subsidiary of the bank  trust company  or foreign banking corporation that is violating or failing to comply with any applicable law  or is conducting activities in an unsafe or injurious manner  enabled the dfi to take action against a person who has engaged in or participated in any unsafe or unsound act with regard to a bank  including a former employee who has left the bank 
it is impossible to predict what effect the enactment of certain of the above mentioned legislation will have on the company 
moreover  it is likely that other bills affecting the business of banks may be introduced in the future by the united states congress or california legislature

item a 
risk factors there are risk factors that may affect the company s business and impact the results of operations  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
difficult market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected the banking industry and could continue to adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company is operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment  including generally uncertain conditions nationally and locally in its markets 
financial institutions continue to be affected by declines in the real estate market that have negatively impacted the credit performance of construction  commercial real estate loans  and residential mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
the company retains direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets  and it is affected by these events 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses  could have an adverse affect on the company s borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in its credit portfolio is made more complex by these difficult market and economic conditions 
the company also expects to face increased regulation and government oversight as a result of these downward trends 
this increased government action may increase the company s costs and limit its ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
in addition  the company may be required to pay even higher fdic deposit insurance premiums than the recently increased level  because financial institution failures resulting from the depressed market conditions and other factors have depleted and may continue to deplete the deposit insurance fund and reduce its ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
a prolonged national economic recession or further deterioration of these conditions in the company s markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in its allowance for credit losses and result in the following consequences increases in loan delinquencies  increases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures  decreases in demand for the company s products and services  which could adversely affect its liquidity position  and decreases in the value of the collateral securing the company s loans  especially real estate  which could reduce customers borrowing power 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult economic conditions on the company  its customers and the other financial institutions in its market 
as a result  the company may experience increases in foreclosures  delinquencies and customer bankruptcies  as well as more restricted access to funds 
the us treasury and the fdic have initiated programs to address economic stabilization  yet the efficacy of these programs in stabilizing the economy and the banking system at large are uncertain 
the bank is subject to certain operating restrictions 
as the result of a recent written agreement with the federal reserve bank see regulatory action included in supervision and regulation section of item  the bank s results of operations and financial condition will be impacted by its ability to address certain conditions or achieve certain financial ratios  including strengthening board oversight of management and the bank s operations  enhancing credit risk management practices and improving the bank s position on the past due loans  classified loans  and other real estate owned  maintaining a sound process for determining  documenting  and recording an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  improving the management of the bank s liquidity position and funds management policies  maintaining sufficient capital at the company and bank level  and improving the bank s earnings and overall condition 
although management of the bank expects to fully address each of these matters  no assurances can be given that the actions of management will be successful 
the failure to address these operating concerns could negatively impact results of operations and the bank s financial condition and lead to additional regulatory action 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented and could adversely impact the company s results of operations and access to capital 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than a year 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if the current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience further adverse effects  which may be material  on its ability to access capital and on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity risk could impair the company s ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition 
liquidity is essential to the company s business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on its liquidity 
the company s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms which are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect the company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact the company s access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which its loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against it 
the company s ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to it  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
the company s financial performance is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s operations are greatly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
deposit flows and the funding costs are influenced by interest rates of competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for loans  which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and by other factors affecting the availability of funds 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income received from interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations  management seeks to manage the balances of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and maintain appropriate maturity and repricing parameters for these assets and liabilities 
a mismatch between the amount of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities in any time period may expose the company to interest rate risk 
generally  if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  the net interest margin will be positively impacted during a rising rate environment and negatively impacted during a declining rate environment 
when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the net interest margin will generally be positively impacted during a declining rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising rate environment 
increases in the level of interest rates may reduce the overall level of loans originated by the company  and  thus  the amount of loan and commitment fees earned  as well as the market value of investment securities and other interest earning assets 
moreover  fluctuations in interest rates may also result in disintermediation  which is the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investments  such as corporate securities and other investment vehicles which  because of the absence of federal deposit insurance  generally pay higher rates of return than depository institutions 
the continued deterioration of local economic conditions in the company s market area could hurt profitability 
the company s operations are located primarily in fresno  madera  kern  and santa clara counties  and are concentrated in fresno county and surrounding areas 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the company s financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these areas 
the local economy in the company s market areas rely heavily on agriculture  real estate  professional and business services  manufacturing  trade and tourism 
the significant economic downturn experienced in the sub prime lending and credit markets since the later part of  has negatively impacted the company s operations and financial condition  and may further worsen with further deterioration of local and state wide economic conditions 
poor economic conditions could cause the company to incur additional losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in the loan portfolio 
concentrations in commercial and industrial loans  real estate secured commercial loans  and real estate construction loans  may expose the company to increased lending risks  especially in the event of a recession 
the company has significant concentrations in commercial real estate and real estate construction loans 
as of december    and of the company s loan portfolio was concentrated in these two categories  respectively 
in addition  the company has many commercial loans to businesses in the construction and real estate industry 
there has been significant volatility in real estate values in the company s market area in recent years  and an extended real estate recession affecting these market areas would likely reduce the security for many of the company s loans and adversely affect the ability of many of borrowers to repay loan balances due the company and require increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
therefore  the company s financial condition and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected by a decline in the value of the real estate securing the company s loans 
if the company forecloses on collateral property  we may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property  resulting in reduced revenues 
the company has and may continue to foreclose on collateral property to protect its investment and may thereafter own and operate such property  in which case we will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate 
the amount that the company  as a mortgagee  may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of the company s control  including  but not limited to i general or local economic conditions  ii neighborhood values  iii interest rates  iv real estate tax rates  v operating expenses of the mortgaged properties  vi environmental remediation liabilities  vii ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties  viii zoning laws  ix governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  and x acts of god 
certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate  principally real estate taxes  insurance  and maintenance costs  may adversely affect the income from the real estate  and as a result  the company may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss 
the foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect the company s ability to generate revenues  resulting in reduced levels of profitability 
the small to medium sized businesses that the company lends to may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy  which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan to the company that could materially harm the company s operating results 
the company targets its business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small to medium sized businesses 
these small to medium sized businesses frequently have smaller market share than their competition  may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results 
any one or more of these factors may impair the borrower s ability to repay a loan 
in addition  the success of a small to medium sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons  and the death  disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan 
economic downturns and other events that negatively impact the company s market areas could cause the company to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the company faces strong competition  which may adversely affect its operating results 
in recent years  competition for bank customers  the source of deposits and loans for the company has greatly intensified 
this competition includes larger regional and national banks and other fdic insured depository institutions in many of the communities the company serves  finance companies  investment banking and brokerage firms  and insurance companies that offer bank like products  credit unions  which can offer highly competitive rates on loans and deposits because they receive tax advantages not available to commercial banks  and technology based financial institutions including large national and super regional banks offering on line deposit  bill payment  and mortgage loan application services 
some of the financial services organizations with which the company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured financial institutions 
as a result  these non bank competitors have certain advantages over the company in accessing funding and in providing various banking related services 
by virtue of their larger capital position  regional and national banks have substantially larger lending limits than the company  and can provide certain services to their customers which the company is not able to offer directly  such as trust and international services 
many of these larger banks also operate with greater economies of scale which result in lower operating costs than the company on a per unit basis 
other existing single or multi branch community banks  or new community bank start ups  have marketing strategies similar to united security bancshares 
these other community banks can open new branches in the communities the company serves and compete directly for customers who want the high level of service community banks offer 
other community banks also compete for the same management personnel and the same potential acquisition and merger candidates 
ultimately  competition can drive down the company s interest margins and reduce profitability  as well as make it more difficult for the company to achieve its growth objectives 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs 
in addition  the company may elect to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions  if any 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of its control  and its financial performance 
the ongoing liquidity crisis and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the company s cost of funding and limit its access to some of its customary sources of capital  including  but not limited to  inter bank borrowings  repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the federal reserve 
the company cannot assure you that such capital will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all 
any occurrence that may limit its access to the capital markets  such as a decline in the confidence of investors  depositors of the banks or counterparties participating in the capital markets  may adversely affect the company s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and  in turn  its liquidity 
an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company could experience loan losses  which exceed the overall allowance for loan losses 
the risk of credit losses on loans and leases varies with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  and  in the case of collateralized loans  the value and marketability of the collateral 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon  among other things  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions  and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and determinations about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans where their collectibility is considered to be questionable 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses was approximately million representing of gross outstanding loans 
although management believes that the allowance is adequate  there can be no absolute assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses 
although the company uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions change substantially from the assumptions used or if negative developments occur with respect to non performing or performing loans 
if management s assumptions or conclusions prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb future losses  or if company s regulatory agencies require an increase in the allowance for loan losses  the company s earnings  and potentially its capital  could be significantly and adversely impacted 
the company is subject to other than temporary impairment risk the company recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of equity  debt securities and cost method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
the company considers various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to changing conditions 
the values of securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will the values of securities that we identify as potentially distressed 
our current evaluation of other than temporary impairments reflects our intent to hold securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value 
however  our intent to hold certain of these securities may change in future periods as a result of facts and circumstances impacting a specific security 
if our intent to hold a security with an unrealized loss changes  and we do not expect the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of disposition  we will write down the security to its fair value in the period that our intent to hold the security changes 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
the company estimates expected future cash flows of its various businesses and determines the carrying value of these businesses 
the company exercises judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses 
the company then compares the carrying value  including goodwill and other intangibles  to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
if the goodwill that the company recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired  it could require charges to earnings  which would have a negative impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets the company acquired in the purchase of another financial institution 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might be impaired 
the company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any such adjustments are reflected in the company s results of operations in the periods in which they become known 
at december   the company s goodwill totaled million after recognizing a goodwill impairment loss of million during the year ended december  given the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that the company s future evaluations of goodwill will not result in additional findings of impairment and related write downs  which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the loss of any of the company s executive officers or key personnel could be damaging to the business 
the company depends upon the skills and reputations of its executive officers and key employees for its future success 
the loss of any of these key persons or the inability to attract and retain other key personnel could adversely affect the company s business operations 
the company s growth and expansion strategy may not prove to be successful and as a result  its market value and profitability may suffer 
the company plans to grow operations within its market area and expand into new market areas when it makes strategic business sense  however the company s capacity to manage any such growth will depend primarily on the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  monitor operations  maintain earnings and control costs 
the company expects to continue to grow its assets and deposits  the products and services which it offers and accordingly the scale of its operations 
the company s ability to manage growth successfully will depend on the ability to maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms 
if the company grows too quickly and is not able to control costs and maintain asset quality  this rapid growth could materially adversely affect the financial performance of the company 
the future successful growth of the company will depend on the ability of its officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve operational  credit  financial  management and other internal risk controls and processes  reporting systems and procedures  and to manage a growing number of customer relationships 
the company may not successfully implement improvements to management information and control systems  and control procedures and processes  in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
in particular  the company s controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in expected loan volume and the infrastructure that comes with growth 
thus  the company s growth strategy may divert management from existing businesses and may require the company to incur additional expenditures to expand its administrative and operational infrastructure 
if the company is unable to manage future expansion in its operations  it may experience compliance and operational problems  need to slow the pace of growth  or need to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth  any one of which could adversely affect the company s business and profitability 
the regulatory environment under which the company operates may have an adverse impact on the banking industry 
the company is subject to extensive regulatory supervision and oversight from both federal and state authorities 
regulatory oversight of the company is provided by the federal reserve bank frb and the california department of financial institutions dfi 
future legislation and government may adversely impact the company and the commercial banking industry in general 
future regulatory changes may also alter the structure and competitive relationship among financial institutions 
the company may be exposed to compliance risk resulting from violations or nonconformity with laws  rules  regulations  internal policies and procedures  or ethical standards set forth by regulatory authorities 
the company may also be subject to compliance risk in situations where laws or rules governing certain products or activities of the company s customers may be uncertain or untested 
compliance risk exposes the company to fines  civil money penalties  payment of damages  and the potential voiding of contracts 
compliance risk can result in diminished reputation  reduced franchise value  limited business opportunities  and reduced growth potential 
increase in fdic insurance premiums may negatively affect profitability 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including the bank 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at a certain level 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures and expectations for further failures  in which case the fdic insures payment of deposits up to insured limits from the deposit insurance fund 
in late  the fdic announced an increase in insurance premium rates of seven basis points  beginning with the first quarter of additional changes  beginning april   were to require riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels 
on may   the fdic adopted a final rule that imposed a special assessment for the second quarter of of five basis points on each insured depository institution s assets minus its tier capital as of june   which was collected on september  the company expensed  during the second quarter for this special assessment 
in november  the fdic approved a final rule to require all insured depository institutions including the bank to prepay three years of fdic assessments in the fourth quarter of  except in the event such prepayment is waived by the fdic 
although the three year prepayment assessment was waived for the bank by the fdic  insurance premiums paid quarterly have increased substantially during the later part of  and may increase in future periods 
in general  we are unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional failures of fdic insured institutions  we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums 
the announced increases and any future increases in fdic insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations 
if the company lost a significant portion of its low cost core deposits  it would negatively impact profitability 
the company s profitability depends in part on its success in attracting and retaining a stable base of low cost deposits 
as of december   noninterest bearing checking accounts comprised of the company s deposit base  and interest bearing checking and money market accounts comprised an additional and  respectively 
the company considers these deposits to be core deposits 
if the company lost a significant portion of these low cost deposits  it would negatively impact its profitability and long term growth objectives 
while management generally does not believe these deposits are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  the competition for these deposits in the company s market area is strong and if the company were to lose a significant portion of these low cost deposits  it would negatively affect business operations 
the company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue 
united security bancshares is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
the company receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiary  united security bank 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on common stock and interest on the company s junior subordinated debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that united security bank and certain non bank subsidiaries may pay to united security bancshares 
also  united security bancshares right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
as a result of the written agreement with the federal reserve bank entered into march   the united security bank is unable to pay dividends to united security bancshares  and united security bancshares is not able to pay dividends on common stock  or pay interest on its junior subordinated debt 
this could have a negative impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
under regulatory restraints  the bank is currently precluded from paying dividends to the company and may be precluded from doing so into the foreseeable future 
we have elected to defer interest payments on our trust preferred securities which prevents us from paying dividends on our capital stock until those payments are brought current 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since the second quarter of and do not expect to resume common stock dividends for the foreseeable future 
in order to preserve capital  we elected at september  to defer quarterly payments of interest on our junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with our trust preferred securities beginning with the quarterly payment due october  the terms of the debentures permit us to defer payment of interest for up to consecutive quarters 
interest continues to accrue while interest payments are deferred 
under the terms of the trust preferred securities we are prohibited from paying cash dividends on our capital stock including common stock during the deferral period 
the holders of the company s junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of the company s shareholders 
on july  the company issued million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with a million trust preferred securities issuance by its subsidiary  united security bancshares capital trust ii 
the junior subordinated debentures mature in july the company conditionally guarantees payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities 
the company s junior subordinated debentures are senior to holders of common stock 
as a result  the company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of common stock 
the company has elected to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of common stock 
the company may become subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  the company may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require the company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although the company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based  in part  on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of its information systems  there can be no assurance that we can prevent any such failures  interruptions or security breaches or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of the company s information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company continually encounters technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in the company s operations 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to the company s customers and even if such products and services are implemented  the company may incur substantial costs in doing so 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company s business 
severe weather  natural disasters  including but not limited to earthquakes and droughts  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company s ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause the company to incur additional expenses 
severe weather or natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of such policies and procedures  and the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

on february   the company completed its merger of legacy bank  na with and into united security bank  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
legacy bank which began operations in operated one banking office in campbell  california serving small business and retail banking clients 
with its small business and retail banking focus  legacy bank provides a unique opportunity for united security bank to serve a loyal and growing small business niche and individual client base in the san jose area 
upon completion of the merger  legacy bank s branch office began operating as a branch office of united security bank 
as of february  legacy bank had net assets of approximately of million  including net loans of approximately million and deposits of approximately million 
in the merger with legacy bank  the company issued  shares of its stock in a tax free exchange for all of the legacy bank common shares 
the total value of the transaction was approximately million 
the merger transaction was accounted for using the purchase accounting method  and resulted in the purchase price being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from legacy based on the fair value of those assets and liabilities 
fair market value adjustments and intangible assets totaled approximately million  including million in goodwill 
the allocations of purchase price based upon the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were finalized during the fourth quarter of during july  the company formed usb capital trust ii  a wholly owned special purpose entity  for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
like usb capital trust i formed in july  usb capital trust ii is a variable interest entity vie and a deconsolidated entity pursuant current accounting standards related to variable interest entities 
on july  usb capital trust ii issued million in trust preferred securities 
the securities have a thirty year maturity and bear a floating rate of interest repricing quarterly of over the three month libor rate 
interest is payable quarterly 
concurrent with the issuance of the trust preferred securities  usb capital trust ii used the proceeds of the trust preferred securities offering to purchase a like amount of junior subordinated debentures of the company 
the company pays interest on the junior subordinated debentures to usb capital trust ii  which represents the sole source of dividend distributions to the holders of the trust preferred securities 
the company elected at september  to defer quarterly payments of interest on the junior subordinated debentures beginning with the quarterly payment due october  the terms of the debentures permit the deferment of payment of interest for up to consecutive quarters 
interest continues to accrue while interest payments are deferred 
under the terms of the trust preferred securities the company is prohibited from paying dividends on its capital stock including common stock during the deferral period 
the company may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at anytime before october at a redemption price of  and thereafter each october as follows at  at  at  at  and at par anytime after october the bank currently has eleven banking branches  one construction lending office  and one financial services office  which provide banking and financial services in fresno  madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
as a community oriented bank holding company  the company continues to seek ways to better meet its customers needs for financial services  and to expand its business opportunities in today s ever changing financial services environment 
the company s strategy is to be a better low cost provider of services to its customer base while enlarging its market area and corresponding customer base to further its ability to provide those services 
the company has made certain reclassifications to the previous year s financial information to conform to the classifications used in effective january   the company reclassified a contingent asset that represents a claim from an insurance company related to a charged off lease portfolio  including specific reserves  from loans to other assets 
management believes the asset is better reflected  given its nature  as an asset other than loans see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for more details 
all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted for the reclassification to other assets and therefore amounts have been excluded from loans and reserves for credit losses  including impaired and nonaccrual balances for periods prior to december  the contingent asset was ultimately settled during the quarter ended june  resulting in a pretax gain of  in addition  at december   the company reclassified certain loans in its portfolio for reporting purposes 
in particular  certain loans previously classified as commercial and industrial loans have been retrospectively reclassified as either construction and development loans  or commercial real estate loans  depending on whether they are partially completed  or are generating rental income see significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for more details 
current trends affecting results of operations and financial position the company s overall operations are impacted by a number of factors  including not only interest rates and margin spreads  which impact results of operations  but also the composition of the company s balance sheet 
one of the primary strategic goals of the company is to maintain a mix of assets that will generate a reasonable rate of return without undue risk  and to finance those assets with a low cost and stable source of funds 
liquidity and capital resources must also be considered in the planning process to mitigate risk and allow for growth 
the following table summarizes the year to date averages of the components of interest bearing assets as a percentage of total interest bearing assets  and the components of interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of total interest bearing liabilities ytd average ytd average ytd average loans investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks federal funds sold total earning assets now accounts money market accounts savings accounts time deposits other borrowings trust preferred securities total interest bearing liabilities continued weakness in the real estate markets and the general economy have impacted the company s operations during the past year with increased levels of nonperforming assets  increased expenses related to foreclosed properties  and decreased profit margins 
although the company continues its business development and expansion efforts throughout its market area  increased attention has been placed on reducing nonperforming assets and providing customers more options to help work through this difficult economic period 
with market rates of interest declining basis points during the fourth quarter of  and another basis points during the year ended december   the company continues to experience compressed net interest margins 
the company s net interest margin was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  with approximately of the loan portfolio in floating rate instruments at december   the effects of low market rates continue to impact loan yields 
loans yielded during the year ended december   as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
with the rapid decline in market rates of interest experienced during  deposit repricing was slow to follow the decline in loan rates during the second half of however  with stock market declines  combined with more substantial fdic insurance coverage  deposit rates declined during the fourth quarter of as investors sought safety in bank deposits 
borrowing rates declined significantly during the fourth quarter of and have remained low during  resulting in overnight and short term borrowing rates of less than during much of the year 
the company has benefited from these rate declines  as it has continued to utilize overnight and short term borrowing lines through the federal reserve and federal home loan bank to a greater degree 
in addition  brokered and other wholesale deposits provided lower rates than much of the company s market area during much of the second half of the company s average cost of funds was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and total noninterest income of million reported for the year ended december  decreased million or as compared to the year ended december   resulting in declines in all but two of the noninterest income categories between the two annual periods 
noninterest income continues to be driven by customer service fees  which totaled million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or over the million in customer service fees reported for the year ended december   and a decrease of  or over the million reported for the year ended december  other components of noninterest income have become more volatile during the past several years as many have been nonrecurring or non sustainable  including gains or losses on other real estate owned through foreclosure or other asset disposals as the company works to reduce problem assets 
although we believe the decline in current economic conditions has had an impact on the level of customer service fees  decreases in atm fees between the periods presented resulting from the loss of a contract during to provide multiple atm s in a single location have also adversely impacted the level of customer service fees 
customer service fees represented   and of total noninterest income for the years ended december    and  respectively 
noninterest expense increased approximately million or between the years ended december  and december   and increased million of between the years ended december  and december  although noninterest expense increased only minimally between and  significant increases experienced during the year ended december  were primarily the result of both increases in impairment charges  as well as increased costs associated with problem loan workouts  as well as oreo maintenance and disposal preparation costs on foreclosed properties 
a major component of the increase in noninterest expense experienced during the year ended december  was a goodwill impairment loss totaling million recognized during the second quarter of while impairment losses on the company s core deposit intangible assets decreased  between the years ended december  and  the company took impairment charges of million during on real estate owned through foreclosure  and  on investment securities 
salary expense decreased million or between the years ended december  and december   primarily as the result of declines in accrued bonuses and employee incentives between the two periods 
effective september  and beginning with the quarterly interest payment due october   the company elected to defer interest payments on the company s million of junior subordinated debentures relating to its trust preferred securities 
this is the result of regulatory restraints which have precluded the bank from paying dividends to the company 
the terms of the debentures and trust indentures allow for the company to defer interest payments for up to consecutive quarters without default or penalty 
during the period that the interest deferrals are elected  the company will continue to record interest expense associated with the debentures 
upon the expiration of the deferral period  all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable 
under the terms of the debenture  the company is precluded from paying cash dividends to shareholders or repurchasing its stock during the deferral period 
the company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock since the second quarter of and does not expect to resume common stock dividends for the foreseeable future 
because the company has elected to defer the quarterly payments of interest on its junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the trust preferred securities as discussed above  the company is prohibited from paying cash dividends on its common stock during the deferral period 
as with the first three quarters of  on december  the company s board of directors again declared a one percent stock dividend on the company s outstanding common stock 
the stock dividend replaces quarterly cash dividends and reflects a similar value 
although the company s capital position remains strong  the change in the dividend from cash to stock begun during the third quarter of was employed as a precaution against uncertainties in the family residential real estate market and the potential impact on the company s construction and related land and lot loan portfolio 
the company believes  given the current uncertainties in the economy and unprecedented declines in real estate valuations in our markets  it is prudent to retain capital in this environment  and better position the company for future growth opportunities 
based upon the number of outstanding common shares on the record date of january   an additional  shares were issued to shareholders on january  for purposes of earnings per share calculations  the company s weighted average shares outstanding and potentially dilutive shares used in the computation of earnings per share have been restated after giving retroactive effect to the stock dividend to shareholders for all periods presented 
the company has sought to maintain a strong  yet conservative balance sheet while reducing the level of nonperforming assets during the year ended december  total assets decreased approximately million during the year ended december   with a decrease of million in interest bearing deposits in other banks and investment securities as the company decreased its borrowing exposure during decreases of million in overnight and term borrowings were partially offset by increases in brokered and other deposits 
declines of approximately million in loans during the year ended december  are due in large part to loan charge offs or transfers to other real estate owned through foreclosure 
average loans comprised approximately of overall average earning assets during the year ended december   a percentage that has remained consistent over the past three years 
nonperforming assets  which are primarily related to the real estate loan and property portfolio  remained high during the year ended december  as real estate markets continue to suffer from the mortgage crisis which began during mid nonaccrual loans totaling million at december   decreased million from the balance reported at december   and decreased million from the balance reported at september  in determining the adequacy of the underlying collateral related to these loans  management monitors trends within specific geographical areas  loan to value ratios  appraisals  and other credit issues related to the specific loans 
impaired loans increased million during the year ended december  to a balance of million at december   but decreased million during the quarter ended december  other real estate owned through foreclosure increased million between december  and december   as transfers of million in loans to other real estate owned during the year more than offset write downs and sales of those assets during the year 
as a result of these events  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased from at december  to at december as the economy has declined along with asset valuations  increased emphasis has been placed on impairment analysis of both tangible and intangible assets on the balance sheet 
as of march   the company conducted annual impairment testing on the largest component of its outstanding balance of goodwill  that of the campbell operating unit resulting from the legacy merger during february in part  as a result of the severe decline in interest rates and other economic factors within the industry  we could not conclude at march  that there was not a possibility of goodwill impairment under the current economic conditions 
during the second quarter of  the company utilized an independent valuation service to determine the aggregate fair value of the individual assets  liabilities  and identifiable intangible assets of the campbell operating unit in question to determine if the goodwill related to that operating unit was impaired  and if so  how much the impairment was 
management  with the assistance of the independent third party  concluded that there was impairment of the goodwill related to the campbell operating unit  and as a result the company recognized an impairment loss of million or per share pre tax and after tax for the quarter ended june  and the year ended december  management continues to monitor economic conditions in the real estate market for signs of further deterioration or improvement which may impact the level of the allowance for credit losses required to cover identified losses in the loan portfolio 
greater focus has been placed on identifying and reducing the level of problem assets  while working with borrowers to find more options  including loan restructures  to work through these difficult economic times 
increased charge offs and significant provisions for loan losses made during materially impacted earnings  but the provisions made to the allowance for credit losses  totaling million during the first quarter of  million during the second quarter of   made during the third quarter of  and million made during the fourth quarter of  provided a level in the allowance for credit losses that is deemed adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
loan and lease charge offs totaling million during the year ended december  included million during the quarter ended march   million during the quarter ended june   million during the quarter ended september   and an additional million during the fourth quarter of deposits increased by million during the year ended december   with increases experienced in both interest bearing checking accounts and time deposits 
increases in time deposits experienced during the later part of were the result of a plan to reduce the company s reliance on borrowed funds 
although balances have declined during the last half of  the company continues to utilize overnight borrowings and other term credit lines  with borrowings totaling million at december   as compared to million at september   million at june   and million at december  the average rate of those term borrowings was at december   as compared to at september   at june   and at december  although the company continues to realize significant interest expense reductions by utilizing these overnight and term borrowings lines  the use of such lines are monitored closely to ensure sound balance sheet management in light of the current economic  credit  and regulatory environment 
the cost of the company s subordinated debentures issued by usb capital trust ii has remained low as market rates have actually declined during most of with pricing at month libor plus basis points  the effective cost of the subordinated debt was at december   representing a rate reduction of basis points between december  and december  pursuant to fair value accounting guidance  the company has recorded million in pretax fair value gains on its junior subordinated debt during the year ended december   bringing the total cumulative gain recorded on the debt to million at december  the company continues to emphasize relationship banking and core deposit growth  and has focused greater attention on its market area of fresno  madera  and kern counties  as well as campbell  in santa clara county 
the san joaquin valley and other california markets continue to exhibit weak demand for construction lending and commercial lending from small and medium size businesses  as commercial and residential real estate markets declined during much of  a condition which still persists at this time 
the past year has presented significant challenges for the banking industry with tightening credit markets  weakening real estate markets  and increased loan losses adversely affecting the industry 
the company continually evaluates its strategic business plan as economic and market factors change in its market area 
balance sheet management  enhancing revenue sources  and maintaining market share will be of primary importance during and beyond 
the banking industry is currently experiencing continued pressure on net margins as well as asset quality resulting from conditions in the real estate market  and a general deterioration in credit markets 
on march   the company and the bank entered into a regulatory agreement with the federal reserve bank which  among other things  requires improvements in the overall condition of the company and the bank see regulatory agreement in the regulatory matters section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more details 
as a result  market rates of interest  asset quality  as well as regulatory oversight will continue be an important factor in the company s ongoing strategic planning process 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated using the company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses  other real estate owned through foreclosure  impairment of collateralized mortgage obligations and other investment securities  and fair value estimates on junior subordinated debt  valuation for deferred income taxes  and goodwill  to be accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the asset quality and allowance for credit losses section of this financial review 
if the loan portfolio were to increase by proportionally throughout all loan classifications  the additional estimated provision to the allowance that would be required  based on the percentage loss allocations utilized at december   would be approximately million pretax  net of tax  or per share basic and diluted 
this estimate is comprised of an additional million  net of tax  or per share basic and diluted for criticized loans those classified as special mention or worse  excluding those considered impaired and subject to asset specific reserve allocations under current accounting guidelines  and an additional   net of tax  or per share basic and diluted for the remainder of the loan portfolio that is performing 
other real estate owned real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell 
the excess  if any  of the loan amount over the fair value of the collateral is charged to the allowance for credit losses 
the determination of fair value is generally based upon pre approved  external appraisals 
as real estate markets declined during over the past two years and essentially became illiquid in many areas  management was required to use additional judgment in determining the factors associated with fair value of the real estate  including the term over which the properties could be disposed in an orderly liquidation 
this became necessary as many appraisals were based upon comparable sales which were deeply discounted forced liquidations or bulk sales caused by the severity of the housing crises 
subsequent declines in the fair value of other real estate owned  along with related revenue and expenses from operations  are charged to noninterest expense 
the fair market valuation of such properties is based upon estimates  and as such  is subject to change as circumstances in the company s market area  or general economic trends  change 
impairment of investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale afs are carried at fair value and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
securities classified as afs or held to maturity htm are subject to review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
in april  the fasb updated the accounting standards for the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
the standard amends existing guidance on other than temporary impairments for debt securities and requires that the credit portion of other than temporary impairments be recorded in earnings and the noncredit portion of losses be recorded in other comprehensive income loss when the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its cost basis 
the company adopted the standard during the first quarter of factors considered in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value  whether the decline is related to a credit event or to a change in interest rate  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
at december   the company considered three of its investment securities other than temporarily impaired 
the three private label collateralized mortgage obligations residential mortgage obligations have an amortized cost of million and carrying value of million 
impairment analysis on these three residential mortgage obligations was performed utilizing the services of a third party investment broker specializing in private label cmo s  and was based upon estimated cash flows 
estimated cash flows were based upon assumptions of future prepayments and default rates  and thus may be subject to revision as events change in the future 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pre tax losses totaling  related to the credit portion of the other than temporary impairment in earnings 
the remaining million impairment on the three residential mortgage obligations is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income at december  fair value effective january   the company adopted fair value option accounting standards choosing to apply the standards to its junior subordinated debt 
the company concurrently adopted the accounting standards related to fair value measurements 
the accounting standards related to fair value measurements defines how applicable assets and liabilities are to be valued  and requires expanded disclosures about financial instruments carried at fair value 
the fair value measurement accounting standard establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments infrequently traded or not quoted in an active market will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
determining fair values under the accounting standards may include judgments related to measurement factors that may vary from actual transactions executed in the marketplace 
for the years ended december  and december   the company recorded fair value gains related to its junior subordinated debt totaling million and million  respectively 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments carried at fair value 
goodwill business combinations involving the company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill 
the acquisition of taft national bank during april gave rise to goodwill totaling approximately million  and the acquisition of legacy bank during february resulted in goodwill of approximately million 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  goodwill is assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually using an internal cash flow model 
during the quarter ended june   the company recognized goodwill impairment of million on the goodwill associated with the legacy acquisition 
while the company believes all assumptions utilized in its assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in earnings  the effective tax rate  historical earnings multiples and the cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are measured using current tax rates applied to such taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
if the company s future income is not sufficient to apply the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the deferred tax asset may not be realized and the company s income will be reduced 
on january  the company adopted the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
the standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under the accounting standards  an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination 
the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than percent 
in assessing whether the more likely than not criterion is met  the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority 
the company reviewed its various tax positions  including its ongoing reit case with the california franchise tax board ftb  as of january  adoption date  and then again each subsequent quarter during in light of the adoption of the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
the bank  with guidance from advisors believes the case related to consent dividends taken by the bank s reit during has merit with regard to points of law  and that the tax law at the time allowed for the deduction of the consent dividend 
however  the bank  with the concurrence of advisors  cannot conclude that it is more than likely as defined that the bank will prevail in its case with the ftb 
as a result of this determination  effective january  the company recorded an adjustment of  to beginning retained earnings upon adoption of the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes to recognize the potential tax liability under the guidelines of the interpretation 
the adjustment includes amounts for assessed taxes  penalties  and interest 
during the years ended december   and  the company increased the unrecognized tax liability by an additional   and  respectively  in interest for the period  bringing the total recorded tax liability to   and  at december   december  and december   respectively 
it is the company s policy to recognize interest and penalties under fin as a component of income tax expense 
pursuant to the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes  the company will continue to re evaluate existing tax positions  as well as new positions as they arise 
if the company determines in the future that its tax positions are not more likely than not to be sustained as defined by taxing authorities  the company may need to recognize additional tax liabilities 
revenue recognition the company s primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans and investment securities 
interest income is generally recorded on an accrual basis  unless the collection of such income is not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated 
pursuant to accounting standards related to revenue recognition  nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans are recognized as a yield adjustment to the related loans by amortizing them into income over the term of the loan using a method which approximates the interest method 
other credit related fees  such as standby letter of credit fees  loan placement fees and annual credit card fees are recognized as noninterest income during the period the related service is performed 
for loans placed on nonaccrual status  the accrued and unpaid interest receivable may be reversed at management s discretion based upon management s assessment of collectibility  and interest is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan 
results of operations for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss of million or per share diluted as compared to net income of million or per share diluted for the year ended december   and net income of million or per share diluted for the year ended december  net income decreased million between december  and december  as the result of increased provisions for credit losses taken during the year  combined with declines in the volume of  and yields on earning assets  as well as increases in other impairment losses and oreo related expenses 
net income decreased million between december  and december  as the result of increased provisions for credit losses taken during the third and fourth quarters  combined with significant declines in market rates of interest during the company s return on average assets was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the same twelve month periods of and  respectively 
the company s return on average equity was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the same twelve month periods of and  respectively 
as with declines in net income  declines in the return on average assets and average equity experienced by the company during were primarily the result of additional loan loss provisions taken during the year  as well as increased impairment losses and oreo related expenses 
net interest income net interest income  the most significant component of earnings  is the difference between the interest and fees received on earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets consist primarily of loans  and to a lesser extent  investments in securities issued by federal  state and local authorities  and corporations  as well as interest bearing deposits and overnight funds with other financial institutions 
these earning assets are funded by a combination of interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities  primarily customer deposits and short term and long term borrowings 
net interest income before provision for credit losses totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million or between the years ended december  and  as compared to a decrease of million or between and the decrease in net interest income between and  as well as between and  is primarily the result of decreased yields on interest earning assets  which more than offset the decreased yields on interest bearing liabilities

as summarized in table  the increase in net interest income between the two twelve month periods ended december  and is comprised of a decrease in total interest income of approximately million  which was only partially offset by a decrease in total interest expense of approximately million 
this change is less severe than the previous year s comparison where an increase in net interest income between the two years ended december  and was comprised of a decrease in total interest income of approximately million  which was only partially offset by a decrease in total interest expense of approximately million 
the bank s year to date net interest margin  as shown in table  increased to at december  from at december   an increase of basis points basis points between the two periods  but decreased basis points from the net margin realized during the year ended december  as a result of changes in market rates of interest  the prime rate averaged for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
both the company s net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume change 
both are also affected by changes in yields on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  referred to as rate change 
the following table sets forth the changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability  and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the years indicated 
changes in interest income and expense  which are not attributable specifically to either rate or volume  are allocated proportionately between the two variances based on the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each

earning asset decline was mostly in loans  with smaller declines in investments and interest bearing deposits in other banks 
on average  loans decreased by approximately million between and as the company focused more on the work out of problem assets 
the company continues to maintain a high percentage of loans in its earning asset mix with loans averaging of total earning assets for the year ended december   as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total interest expense decreased approximately million between the years ended december  and as a result of significant decreases in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities during  combined with decreases in the volumes of those interest bearing liabilities 
deposit rates continued to decline throughout much of as the federal reserve lengthened the anticipated duration of the low interest rate cycle in its efforts to resolve the severe economic downturn 
between the years ended december  and december   rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased in all categories  and on average decreased to almost half of what they had been during the year ended december  during  the company benefited as it utilized lower cost funding sources including overnight and short term borrowings  as well as brokered and other wholesale time deposits  which provided funding rates of less then during a significant portion of the year 
total interest income decreased approximately million or between the years ended december  and  and is attributable primarily to significant declines in market rates of interest resulting in decreased net interest margins  which outweighed minor increases experienced in average earning assets 
loans were most adversely impacted by yield declines as approximately two thirds of the loan portfolio is comprised of floating rate instruments 
total interest expense decreased approximately million between the years ended december  and  primarily as a result of decreased rates paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings as market rates of interest continued to decline throughout most of rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased in all categories  with the greatest decreases experienced in time deposits  borrowings through the fhlb and the frb  and the company s junior subordinated debt 
the company s interest bearing liability mix changed during with declines in average deposit accounts  especially time deposits  which was more than offset by increases in the average volume of other borrowings including fhlb advances and overnight borrowings from the federal reserve 
on average  time deposits decreased million  interest bearing demand accounts decreased by million  and savings accounts decreased by million between the years ended december  and december  the decrease in average deposits was more than offset by increases of more than million in other borrowings between the years ended december  and december  provision for credit losses provisions for credit losses and the amount added to the allowance for credit losses is determined on the basis of management s continuous credit review of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  current and future economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
such factors consider the allowance for credit losses to be adequate when it covers estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on the condition of the loan portfolio  management believes the allowance is sufficient to cover risk elements in the loan portfolio 
for the year ended december  the provision to the allowance for credit losses amounted to million as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  increases in the provision to the allowance for credit losses included large provisions during the second and fourth quarters of the year as prolonged weakness in the economy  and specifically the residential housing market  required the company to become even more proactive in its assessment of problem loans 
provisions of million and million were made in the second and fourth quarters of increases in the provision to the allowance for credit losses during  including provisions of million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  were the result of higher levels of nonperforming loans during the year  and general deterioration in the housing and credit markets which began during the later part of  and continued throughout the amount provided to the allowance for credit losses during brought the allowance to of net outstanding loan balances at december   as compared to of net outstanding loan balances at december   and at december  noninterest income the following table summarizes significant components of noninterest income for the years indicated and the net changes between those years years ended december  increase decrease during year in thousands customer service fees gain on disposition of securities gain loss on sale of oreo gain on sale of assets proceeds from life insurance gain loss on swap ineffectiveness gain on fair value option of financial liabilities gain loss on sale of fixed assets shared appreciation income other total noninterest income consists primarily of fees and commissions earned on services that are provided to the company s banking customers and  to a lesser extent  gains on sales of company assets and other miscellaneous income 
noninterest income for the year ended december  decreased million or when compared to the previous year  and decreased million or when compared to the year ended december  decreases in noninterest income were experienced in all but two categories during  with decreases experienced in customer service fees  gains in oreo sales  and shared appreciation income 
increases were experienced in gains on sale of assets as the company disposed of a large inventory of agricultural equipment that had been foreclosed upon during the year 
the decrease of  in other noninterest income experienced during includes a decrease of approximately  on oreo rental income  an income decline which the company does not expect to see change in the future 
the loss of  realized during on the disposition of investment securities was the result of the sale of a million mutual fund that was disposed of for liquidity purposes 
decreases in noninterest income experienced during as compared to were primarily the result of a decrease in fair value gains recorded on the company s junior subordinated debt  as well as an employee death benefit payment received during that did not occur again during the gain on disposition of securities totaling  during was the result of an early call on municipal bonds with an amortized cost of approximately  the municipal bonds were redeemed at face value  resulting in a recognized gain on the remaining unaccreted discount 
customer service fees continue to provide a substantial part of noninterest income over the three years presented  representing   and of total noninterest income for the years ended december    and  respectively 
customer service fees decreased  between the years ended december  and december   and decreased  between the years ended december and december  much of the decrease in customer service fees between the periods presented is attributable to decreases in atm fee income 
additionally  decreases of approximately  were experienced in revenue generated by the company s financial services department between the years ended december  and december  the company has experienced decreases in gains realized from the sale of other real estate owned through foreclosure and  actually realized net pre tax losses of  during as compared to net pre tax gains of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
with continued and prolonged deterioration in real estate markets  the company has sought to dispose of properties when economically possible rather than continue to hold them and incur ongoing carrying costs to maintain the properties 
shared appreciation income has fluctuated over the three years presented  with decreases of  between and  as compared to increases of  between and shared appreciation income results from agreements between the company and the borrower on certain construction loans where the company agrees to receive interest on the loan at maturity rather than monthly and the borrower agrees to share in the profits of the project 
the profit is determined by the appraised value of the completed project and subsequent refinancing or sale of the project 
due to the difficulty in calculating future values  shared appreciation income is recognized when received 
the company does not participate in a significant number of shared appreciation projects  and as a result  does not anticipate large amounts of shared appreciation income on an ongoing basis 
noninterest expense the following table sets forth the components of total noninterest expense in dollars and as a percentage of average earning assets for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands amount of average earning assets amount of average earning assets amount of average earning assets salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense data processing professional fees fdic dfi assessments directors fees amortization of intangibles correspondent bank service charges writedown on investment impairment loss on oreo impairment loss on intangible assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on investment securities loss on lease assets held for sale loss on ca tax credit partnership oreo expense other total noninterest expense  excluding provision for credit losses and income tax expense  totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these figures represent an increase of million or between the years ended december  and and an increase of million or between the years ended december  and as a percentage of average earning assets  total noninterest expense has remained relatively stable over the past three years  but increased slightly  as the company has successfully controlled overhead expenses in a challenging economic environment 
noninterest expense amounted to of average earning assets for the year ended december  as compared to at december  and at december  the net increase in noninterest expense between the years ended december  and is in large part the result of million in goodwill impairment losses taken during second quarter of other changes in noninterest expense are comprised of reductions in salaries and bonus incentives of nearly million  and reductions in occupancy and data processing costs of  which were more than offset by increases in oreo impairment and overhead costs  legal fees  fdic insurance assessments  and other expenses associated with nonperforming and foreclosed loans  as well as changes in the components of other impairment losses taken on various assets of the company 
as the economy has declined over the past year  the company has streamlined certain departments to more effectively control salary and employee benefit costs where the levels of business are lower than they have been historically 
the increase of  in other noninterest expense between the years ended december  and is primarily the result of a legal settlement totaling  for a disputed atm servicing contract with a third party servicer 
while impairment losses on intangible assets decreased  or between the years ended december  and  additional impairment losses were recorded during on other of the company s assets 
impairment losses totaling million were realized on oreo during as oreo properties were further written down to fair value as new valuations were received 
in addition  during the year ended december   the company recognized  in impairment losses  during the first quarter   during the second quarter   during the third quarter  and  during the fourth quarter of on three of its non agency collateralized mortgage obligations which were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
the amount expensed as impairment losses on the three securities represents the identified credit related portion of the impairment 
although there are some indications of improvement in current economic conditions  a prolonged recessionary period could result in additional impairment losses in the future 
increases in noninterest expense between the years ended december  and december  include impairment losses of  on oreo  and  on intangible assets 
with economic conditions deteriorating during  increased emphasis has been placed on impairment review  as the values on many assets have declined 
impairment losses on oreo properties are also a function of an increase in the volume of oreo acquired during  which is also reflected in the increase of  in oreo expense during decreases in noninterest expense have been realized in many categories during including a decrease of  in salary expense   in data processing expense  and  in professional fees 
the decrease in salary expense between the years ended december  and december  is primarily the result of a reduction in bonuses and incentives paid during  many of which are based upon the company s net income 
during the years ended december    and  the company recognized stock based compensation expense of  less than per share basic and diluted   per share basic and diluted  and  per share basic and diluted  respectively 
this expense is included in noninterest expense under salaries and employee benefits 
under the current pool of stock options  the company expects stock based compensation expense to be about  per quarter for  and decline after that through if new stock options are issued  or existing options fail to vest due  for example  to forfeiture  actual stock based compensation expense in future periods will change 
income taxes the company s income tax expense is impacted to some degree by permanent taxable differences between income reported for book purposes and income reported for tax purposes  as well as certain tax credits which are not reflected in the company s pretax income or loss shown in the statements of operations and comprehensive income 
as pretax income or loss amounts become smaller  the impact of these differences become more significant and are reflected as variances in the company s effective tax rate for the periods presented 
in general  the permanent differences and tax credits affecting tax expense have a positive impact and tend to reduce the effective tax rates shown in the company s statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the company reviews its current tax positions at least quarterly based accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes which includes the criteria that an individual tax position would have to meet for some or all of the income tax benefit to be recognized in a taxable entity s financial statements 
under the income tax guidelines  an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination 
the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than percent 
in assessing whether the more likely than not criterion is met  the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority 
on december  the california franchise tax board ftb announced certain tax transactions related to real estate investment trusts reits and regulated investment companies rics will be disallowed pursuant to senate bill and assembly bill  which were signed into law in the th quarter of as a result  the company reversed related net state tax benefits recorded in the first three quarters of and has taken no related tax benefits since that time 
the company continues to review the information available from the ftb and its financial advisors and believes that the company s position has merit 
the company will pursue its tax claims and defend its use of these entities and transactions 
at this time  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome 
pursuant to the guidance  the company reviewed its reit tax position as of january  adoption date of the new guidance  and then has again reviewed its position each subsequent quarter since adoption 
the bank  with guidance from advisors  believes that the case has merit with regard to points of law  and that the tax law at the time allowed for the deduction of the consent dividend 
however  the bank  with the concurrence of advisors  cannot conclude that it is more than likely that the bank will prevail in its case with the ftb 
as a result of this determination  effective january  the company recorded an adjustment of million to beginning retained earnings upon adoption of the new guidance related to uncertainty in income taxes to recognize the potential tax liability under the guidelines of the interpretation 
the adjustment includes amounts for assessed taxes  penalties  and interest 
during the years ended december  and  the company increased the unrecognized tax liability by an additional  in interest for each of the two years  bringing the total recorded tax liability to million at december  the company has determined that there has been no material change to its position on the reit from that at december   and as a result recorded additional interest liability of  during the year ended december  it is the company s policy to recognize interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
the company has reviewed all of its tax positions as of december   and has determined that  other than the reit  there are no other material amounts that should be recorded under the current income tax accounting guidelines 
financial condition total assets decreased by million or during the year to million at december   and decreased million or from the balance of million at december  during the year ended december   decreases of million were experienced in net loans as construction and real estate lending slowed and approximately million in problem loans were transferred to oreo  while another million was charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
interest bearing deposits in other banks and investment securities decreased by million and million  respectively  during the year ended december  total deposits of million at december  increased million or from the balance reported at december   and decreased million or from the balance of million reported at december  deposit growth during occurred in interest bearing checking accounts and time deposits of  or more  while other deposit categories experienced declines between december  and december  increases in time deposits during are in large part the result of additional brokered deposits which were obtained as the company sought to reduce its dependence on overnight and term borrowings from the federal reserve and fhlb 
during  net loans decreased million  while interest bearing deposits in other banks and investment securities increased million and million  respectively  between the two period ends 
during  growth of million and million was experienced in noninterest bearing deposits and time deposits of less than  respectively  which was more than offset by substantial declines in time deposits of  or more  and to a lesser degree interest bearing checking and savings accounts 
the decrease of million in time deposits of  or more experienced during was primarily the result of brokered time deposits and deposits from the state of california  which were not renewed as they matured during the brokered time deposits were replaced with less expensive borrowings including fhlb advances and overnight borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
earning assets averaged approximately million during the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
average interest bearing liabilities decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   and decreased from the balance of million for the year ended december  loans the company s primary business is that of acquiring deposits and making loans  with the loan portfolio representing the largest and most important component of its earning assets 
loans totaled million at december   representing a decrease of million or when compared to the balance of million at december   and a decrease of million or when compared to the balance of million reported at december  total loans decreased approximately million during the fourth quarter of  million of which was the result of transfers of nonperforming loans to oreo  and another million was the result of charge offs against the reserve for loan and lease losses 
average loans totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during average loans decreased when compared to the year ended december  and decreased compared to the year ended december  the following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category and the category percentages as of the year end dates indicated in thousands dollar amount of loans dollar amount of loans dollar amount of loans dollar amount of loans dollar amount of loans commercial and industrial real estate mortgage re construction development agricultural installment other lease financing total loans although the company does not generally provide permanent financing for its construction and development loans  shorter term permanent financing or mini perm loans have been provided to a number of borrowers over the past several years as the current economic downturn has prolonged the development and completion of some projects 
at the time of their renewal  some of these loans were classified as commercial and industrial loans because either the construction and development portion of the project had been delayed  or the project had been completed and the borrower opted to delay the sale of the completed project until market conditions improved 
some of the completed projects are currently providing rental income to the borrower 
upon review  it was determined that the company had classified certain of its loans as commercial and industrial which  should have been classified as something other than commercial and industrial loans 
as a result  at december   the company retrospectively reclassified for reporting purposes forty seven loans from commercial and industrial loans to either construction land development  or commercial real estate loans  depending on whether they are partially completed  or are generating rental income 
the reclassification had no impact on the company s results of operations 
the following summarizes the reclassification amounts for the periods prior to december  in s

lease financing decreased  during  as the company is no longer originating commercial leases 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases of million in real estate mortgage loans  a portion of which were the result of construction loans which were completed or matured during the year and the borrower obtained longer term financing from the company 
approximately million of the total million decrease in loans experienced during the year ended december   was the result of nonperforming loans transferred to other real estate owned when all other means of settlement were exhausted 
during  the company experienced a decrease of million or in construction loans  and decreases of million and  in real estate mortgage loans  and commercial and industrial loans  respectively 
lease financing decreased million during  as the company is no longer originating commercial leases 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases of million in agricultural loans  and million in consumer installment loans 
part of the decrease in construction and real estate loans experienced during is the result of transfers of approximately million million net of charge offs in nonperforming loans to oreo 
during loan growth occurred in all categories except lease financing

agricultural loans increased million or during  and real estate construction loans increased million or during the acquisition of legacy bank during february contributed approximately million to the loan growth experienced during during the fourth quarter of loan volume declined approximately million or as the company slowed additional loan growth as part of its asset liability management and liquidity plan 
at december   approximately of commercial and industrial loans have floating rates and  although some may be secured by real estate  many are secured by accounts receivable  inventory  and other business assets 
residential housing markets have suffered considerably since the later half of  and as a result  residential construction loans decreased during and again during real estate construction loans decreased million or during  as compared to a decrease of million or during  and an increase of million or during construction loans are generally short term  floating rate obligations  which consist of both residential and commercial projects 
agricultural loans consisting of mostly short term  floating rate loans for crop financing  decreased million or between december  and december   while installment loans decreased million or during that same period 
the real estate mortgage loan portfolio totaling million at december  consists of commercial real estate  residential mortgages  and home equity loans 
commercial real estate is the core of this segment of the portfolio  with balances of million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
commercial real estate loans are generally a mix of short to medium term  fixed and floating rate instruments and  are mainly tied to commercial income and multi family residential properties 
the company does not currently offer traditional residential mortgage loans  but may purchase mortgage portfolios 
as a result of real estate mortgage purchases over the past several years  that portion of the portfolio has remained relatively stable with balances of million  million  and million at december   and  respectively

the bank s loan portfolio is generally comprised of short term or floating rate loans and is therefore susceptible to fluctuations in market rates of interest 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   representing a decrease of basis points when compared to the year ended december  and was a result of a significant decrease in market rates of interest during the average loan yield for was also impacted by the reversal of approximately million in interest on nonaccrual loans  reducing the average loan yield by basis points for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the average yield on loans was  representing a decrease of basis points when compared to the year ended december  and was a result of increased loan pricing pressures experienced during which more than outweighed an average increase of basis point in the prime rate between the year ended december  and december  the bank s loan portfolio is generally comprised of short term or floating rate loans and is therefore susceptible to fluctuations in market rates of interest

in addition  one mutual fund with a carrying cost of million was sold during the fourth quarter of to provide additional liquidity 
investment securities increased million between december and december  as us government agencies and municipal bonds were either paid down or matured  and additional funds from maturing loans were utilized to purchase additional investment securities or interest bearing deposits in other banks 
securities that have been temporarily impaired less than months at december  are comprised of two us government agency securities and one collateralized mortgage obligation with a weighted average life of years 
as of december   there were three residential mortgage obligations  and one other investment security with a total weighted average life of years that have been temporarily impaired for twelve months or more 
at december   the decline in market value for all but three see below of the impaired securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity  and not credit quality 
because the company does not have the intent to sell these impaired securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery  the company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  at december   the company had three non agency residential mortgage obligations which have been impaired more than twelve months 
all three residential mortgage obligations were rated less than high credit quality at december  the residential mortgage obligations had a market value of million and unrealized losses of approximately million at december  the company evaluated these three residential mortgage obligations for otti by comparing the present value of expected cash flows to previous estimates to determine whether there had been adverse changes in cash flows during the quarter 
the otti evaluation was conducted utilizing the services of a third party specialist and consultant in mbs and cmo products 
the cash flow assumptions used in the evaluation included a number of factors including changes in delinquency rates  anticipated prepayment speeds  loan to value ratios  changes in agency ratings  and market prices 
as a result of the impairment evaluation  the company determined that there had been adverse changes in cash flows during the quarter for all three of the residential mortgage obligations reviewed  and concluded that these three investments were other than temporarily impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  the three residential mortgage obligations had other than temporary impairment losses of million  of which  was recorded as expense and million was recorded in other comprehensive loss 
on a year to date basis  the three residential mortgage obligations had other than temporary impairment losses of million  of which  was recorded as expense and million was recorded in other comprehensive loss

as of december   there were two other investment securities with a total weighted average life of years that have been temporarily impaired for twelve months or more 
the unrealized losses are due in most part to interest rate changes  as well as credit downgrades in some of the portfolio including three collateralized mortgage obligations 
the company has the ability and intent to hold all investment securities with identified impairments resulting from interest rate changes and credit downgrades to the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security 
the company believes that credit downgrades on securities within the portfolio are a result of the severity of the current economic downturn and does not believe the downgrades will result in permanent impairment of those securities

the company increased brokered deposits during as part of its liquidity strategy to reduce dependence on overnight and term borrowings from the federal reserve and fhlb 
although pricing on borrowing remains attractive  access to credit lines has become more vulnerable as risk profiles of most banks have increased in the current economic environment 
pricing of brokered time deposits and other wholesale deposits remain extremely low at this time and currently provides a viable alternate to borrowings from the federal reserve or the fhlb 
the company believes this rate structure will eventually turn  and wholesale funding sources  both deposits and borrowings  will again become expensive relative to other core deposits in the marketplace 
the company will continue to use pricing strategies to control the overall level of time deposits and other borrowings as part of its growth and liquidity planning process  but will continue to emphasize core deposits as part of its long term relationship banking strategy 
as a result  core deposits  including now and money market accounts  and savings accounts  as well as noninterest bearing checking accounts  continue to provide the company s primary funding source 
during the year ended december   decreases were experienced primarily in time deposits  and to a lesser degree in interest bearing checking accounts and saving accounts 
brokered and other time deposits were allowed to runoff as they matured during  as the company sought other less expensive funding sources including fhlb advances and overnight borrowings from the federal reserve 
in addition  time deposits from the state of california  which totaled million at both december  and december   were not renewed by the state of california during the company had increased brokered deposits throughout as part of its liquidity strategy begun during to fund loan growth as core deposits became increasingly difficult to obtain and pricing became more competitive 
as market rates of interest declined during  brokered deposit pricing did not decline to the same degree  due largely to liquidity and credit issues in the market place 
as a result  brokered deposits and other time deposits became less attractive as a funding source 
now and money market accounts  as well as savings accounts declined million and million  respectively  between december  and december  as these deposits remain competitive 
during the year ended december  increases were experienced primarily in time deposits  and to a lesser degree in saving accounts 
increases in time deposits during were largely the result brokered time deposits obtained by the company as part of its liquidity strategy begun during to fund loan growth as core deposits became increasingly difficult to obtain and pricing became more competitive 
this liquidity strategy allowed the company to obtain the additional funding sources needed during to fund loan growth without adversely impacting the cost of its core deposit base 
now and money market accounts  as well as noninterest bearing deposits declined million and million  respectively  between december  and december  as these deposits became increasingly competitive 
the company s deposit base consists of two major components represented by noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing deposits 
interest bearing deposits consist of time certificates  now and money market accounts and savings deposits

short term borrowings the company has the ability to obtain borrowed funds consisting of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank fhlb advances as alternatives to retail deposit funds 
the company has established collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit with several correspondent banks  as well as a securities dealer  for the purpose of obtaining borrowed funds as needed 
the company may continue to borrow funds in the future as part of its asset liability strategy  and may use these funds to acquire certain other assets as deemed appropriate by management for investment purposes and to better utilize the capital resources of the bank 
federal funds purchased represent temporary overnight borrowings from correspondent banks and are generally unsecured 
repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgage backed securities and securities of us government agencies  and generally have maturities of one to six months  but may have longer maturities if deemed appropriate as part of the company s asset liability management strategy 
fhlb advances are collateralized by the company s investment in fhlb stock  securities  and certain qualifying mortgage loans 
in addition  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the federal reserve bank of san francisco  which would be collateralized by certain pledged loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the lines of credit are subject to periodic review of the company s financial statements by the grantors of the credit lines 
lines of credit may be modified or revoked at any time if the grantors feel there are adverse trends in the company s financial position 
the company had collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit aggregating million and million  as well as fhlb lines of credit totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   the company had total outstanding balances of million drawn against its fhlb line of credit 
of the million in fhlb borrowings outstanding at december   all mature within three months and have an average rate of 
these lines of credit generally have interest rates tied to the federal funds rate or are indexed to short term us treasury rates or libor

implicit in lending activities is the fact that losses will be experienced and that the amount of such losses will vary from time to time  depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by local economic conditions and the financial experience of borrowers 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans and commitments to extend credit  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  collateral  and concentrations of credit 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and the state of the local economy 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  the company follows  in accordance with gaap  the guidelines set forth in the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses statement issued jointly by banking regulators during  and updated and revised in the statement outlines characteristics that should be used in segmentation of the loan portfolio for purposes of the analysis including risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
it also outlines factors to consider when adjusting the loss factors for various segments of the loan portfolio 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
was also released at this time which represents the sec staff s view relating to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commission s interpretations 
it is also generally consistent with the guidance published by the banking regulators 
the allowance for loan losses includes an asset specific component  as well as a general or formula based component 
the company segments the loan and lease portfolio into eleven segments  primarily by loan class and type  that have homogeneity and commonality of purpose and terms for analysis under the formula based component of the allowance 
those loans which are determined to be impaired under current accounting guidelines are not subject to the formula based reserve analysis  and evaluated individually for specific impairment under the asset specific component of the allowance 
the eleven segments of the company s loan portfolio are as follows subtotals are provided as needed to allow the reader to reconcile the amounts to the company s loan classification reported elsewhere in these financial statements loan segments for loan loss reserve analysis loan balance at december  dollars in s commercial and business loans government program loans total commercial and industrial commercial real estate term loans single family residential loans home improvement home equity loans total real estate mortgage total real estate construction loans total agricultural loans consumer loans overdraft protection lines overdrafts total installment other total lease financing total loans the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance  specific allowances for problem graded loans classified loans and the unallocated allowance in addition  the allowance analysis also incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans as provided current accounting standards for contingencies 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans and certain unfunded loan commitments 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience and on the internal risk grade of those loans and  may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
factors that may affect collectibility of the loan portfolio include levels of  and trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans  trends in volumes and term of loans  effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  collection  charge off  and recovery  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions and  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio  including high balance loan concentrations and participations 
management determines the loss factors for problem graded loans substandard  doubtful  and loss  special mention loans  and pass graded loans  based on a loss migration model 
the migration analysis incorporates loan losses over the past twelve quarters three years and loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure from changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
for purposes of this analysis  loans are grouped by internal risk classifications  which are pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
certain loans are homogenous in nature and are therefore pooled by risk grade 
these homogenous loans include consumer installment and home equity loans 
special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard  doubtful  and loss 
at december   problem graded or classified loans totaled million or of gross loans  as compared to million or of gross loans at september   and million or of gross loans at december  loan participations are reviewed for allowance adequacy under the same guidelines as other loans in the company s portfolio  with an additional participation factor added  if required  for specific risks associated with participations 
in general  participations are subject to certain thresholds set by the company  and are reviewed for geographic location as well as the well being of the underlying agent bank 
the formula allowance includes reserves for certain off balance sheet risks including letters of credit  unfunded loan commitments  and lines of credit 
reserves for undisbursed commitments are generally formula allocations based on the company s historical loss experience and other loss factors  rather than specific loss contingencies 
at december   and the formula reserve allocated to undisbursed commitments totaled   and  respectively 
the reserve for unfunded commitments is considered a reserve for contingent liabilities and is therefore carried as a liability on the balance sheet for all periods presented 
specific allowances are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified loans  impaired loans  and other loans in which management believes there is a probability that a loss has been incurred in excess of the amount determined by the application of the formula allowance 
for impaired loans  specific allowances are determined based on the collateralized value of the underlying properties  the net present value of the anticipated cash flows  or the market value of the underlying assets 
formula allowances for classified loans excluding impaired loans  specific allowances  where required  are determined on the basis of additional risks involved with individual loans that may be in excess of risk factors associated with the loan portfolio as a whole 
the specific allowance is different from the formula allowance in that the specific allowance is determined on a loan by loan basis based on risk factors directly related to a particular loan  as opposed to the formula allowance which is determined for a pool of loans with similar characteristics  based on past historical trends and other risk factors which may be relevant on an ongoing basis 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is the result of both expected and unanticipated changes in various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions 
the following table summarizes the specific allowance  formula allowance  and unallocated allowance at december   september  and december  balance balance balance in s december  september  december  specific allowance impaired loans formula allowance classified loans not impaired formula allowance special mention loans total allowance for special mention and classified loans formula allowance for pass loans unallocated allowance total allowance impaired loans classified loans not considered impaired total classified loans special mention loans impaired loans increased approximately million between december  and december   but decreased approximately million during the quarter ended december  the specific allowance related to impaired loans increased million and  for the year ended and quarter ended december   respectively 
the formula allowance related to loans that are not impaired including special mention and substandard decreased approximately  between december  and december   and decreased  during the quarter ended december  increases for the year ended december  were the result of increases in adjusting factors for current economic trends and conditions  and trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans  as well as increased asset specific reserves on certain loan relationships 
even though the level of pass loans decreased approximately million during the year ended december   the related formula allowance increased  during as a result of an increase in percentage loss allocations  as well as factor allocation increases due to current economic conditions 
at december   the company segregated approximately million of the total million in substandard classified loans for purposes of the quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses under the formula allowance 
many of these loans had been downgraded to substandard because the borrowers had other direct or indirect lending relationships which were classified as substandard or impaired 
the million in substandard loans consisted of ten borrowing relationships  which although classified as substandard  the company believed were performing and therefore did not warrant the same loss factors as other substandard loans in the portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses related to this million pool of substandard loans was based upon current payment history  loan to value ratios  future anticipated performance  and other various factors 
the formula allowance for credit losses related to these substandard loans totaled million at december  this formula reserve was previously included in the formula allowance for special mention and classified loans totaling million at december  in the above table 
during the second quarter of  the performance of the segregated substandard loan portfolio deteriorated to a point where management determined that the loans were either impaired or subject to the higher loss factors traditionally applied to other substandard loans 
as a result  approximately million of the previously segregated substandard loans were transferred to impaired loans  and the remainder analyzed using applicable formula loss factors related to their risk ratings 
the increase in the reserve for impaired loans related to this transfer totaled million during the quarter ended june  and an increase of approximately  in other reserve categories during the same period 
the company s methodology includes features that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses 
the specific allowance portion of the analysis is designed to be self correcting by taking into account the current loan loss experience based on that portion of the portfolio 
by analyzing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  management is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates using the most recent information available 
in performing the periodic migration analysis  management believes that historical loss factors used in the computation of the formula allowance need to be adjusted to reflect current changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
there are a number of other factors  which are reviewed when determining adjustments in the historical loss factors 
they include trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans  trends in loan volume and terms  effects of changes in lending policies  concentrations of credit  competition  national and local economic trends and conditions  experience of lending staff  loan review and board of directors oversight  high balance loan concentration  and other business conditions 
other than the reclassification of approximately million in previously segregated substandard loans during discussed above  there were no changes in estimation methods or assumptions during that affected the methodology for assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
management and the company s lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a weekly and monthly basis  and through discussions and officer meetings as conditions change 
the company s loan committee meets weekly and serves as a forum to discuss specific problem assets that pose significant concerns to the company  and to keep the board of directors informed through committee minutes 
all special mention and classified loans are reported quarterly on criticized asset reports  which are reviewed by senior management 
with this information  the migration analysis and the impaired loan analysis are performed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are made to the allowance as deemed necessary 
as the real estate market and economic crisis became more severe beginning during the later part of  the company successfully worked with many of its borrowers to re margin loans as collateral values declined  weakening the company s credit position and increasing the potential for losses 
this process of working with potentially troubled borrowers is monitored closely through the loan review process 
the specific allowance for impaired loans is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary differences between impaired loans and nonperforming loans are i all loan categories are considered in determining nonperforming loans while impaired loan recognition is limited to commercial and industrial loans  commercial and residential real estate loans  construction loans  and agricultural loans  and ii impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include problem loans other than delinquent loans 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans  restructured debt  and performing loans in which full payment of principal or interest is not expected 
management bases the measurement of these impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral or the expected cash flows on the loans discounted at the loan s stated interest rates 
cash receipts on impaired loans not performing to contractual terms and that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce principal balances 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to the provision  if applicable 
at december  and  the company s recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized totaled million and million  respectively 
included in total impaired loans at december   are million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
total impaired loans at december  included million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in most cases  the company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans 
in the case of certain troubled debt restructuring for which the loan is performing under the current contractual terms  income is recognized under the accrual method 
for the year ended december   the company recognized  in income on such loans 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized no income on such loans 
the largest category of impaired loans during the year ended december  has been real estate construction and development loans  with that loan category comprising almost of total impaired loans at december  impaired construction loans decreased million  impaired commercial and industrial loans decreased million  and impaired agricultural loans decreased million during the fourth quarter of although impaired balances for construction loans have declined slightly during the year ended december   and construction loans are generally collateral dependent and the related collateral is considered adequate to cover the loan s carrying value in many cases  the specific reserve related to impaired construction loans has increased approximately million since december  as property valuations have declined 
specific collateral related to impaired loans is reviewed for current appraisal information  economic trends within geographic markets  loan to value ratios  and other factors that may impact the value of the loan collateral 
adjustments are made to collateral values as needed for these factors 
of total impaired loans  approximately million or are secured by real estate

the company continues to experience increased competition from major banks  local independents and non bank institutions creating pressure on loan pricing 
with interest rates decreasing basis points during the fourth quarter of  another basis points during  indications are that the economy will continue to suffer in the near future as a result of sub prime lending problems  a weakened real estate market  and tight credit markets 
as a result of these conditions  the company has placed increased emphasis on reducing both the level of nonperforming assets and the level of losses taken  if any  on the disposition of these assets if required it has been in the best interest of both the company and the borrowers to seek alternative options to foreclosure in an effort to diminish the impact on an already depressed real estate market 
as part of this strategy  the company has increased its level of troubled debt restructurings  when it makes economic sense 
both business and consumer spending have slowed during the past several quarters  and current gdp projections for the next year have softened significantly 
it is difficult to determine to what degree the federal reserve will adjust short term interest rates in its efforts to influence the economy  or what magnitude government economic support programs will reach 
it is likely that the business environment in california will continue to be influenced by these domestic as well as global events 
the local market has remained relatively more stable economically during the past several years than other areas of the state and the nation  which have experienced more volatile economic trends  including significant deterioration of residential real estate markets 
although the local area residential housing markets have been hit hard  they continue to perform better than other parts of the state  which should bode well for sustained  but slower growth in the company s market areas of fresno and madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
local unemployment rates in the san joaquin valley remain high primarily as a result of the areas agricultural dynamics  however unemployment rates have increased recently as the national economy has declined 
it is difficult to predict what impact this will have on the local economy 
the company believes that the central san joaquin valley will continue to grow and diversify as property and housing costs remain reasonable relative to other areas of the state 
management recognizes increased risk of loss due to the company s exposure from local and worldwide economic conditions  as well as potentially volatile real estate markets  and takes these factors into consideration when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the following table provides a summary of the company s allowance for credit losses  provisions made to that allowance  and charge off and recovery activity affecting the allowance for the years indicated

no assurance can be given  however  that the economic conditions which may adversely affect the company s service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
management is not currently aware of any conditions that may adversely affect the levels of losses incurred in the company s loan portfolio 
although the company does not normally allocate the allowance for credit losses to specific loan categories  an allocation to the major categories has been made for the purposes of this report as set forth in the following table 
the allocations are estimates based on the same factors as considered by management in determining the amount of additional provisions to the credit loss allowance and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses

increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans are the result of increased loan volume and increased loss factors applied to classified loan classifications  while increases in reserve allocations for real estate mortgage and installment loans are primarily the result of increases in substandard loans in those categories 
reserve allocations increased for real estate construction loans as a result of both an increase in the level of special mention loans in that category  as well as increased specific reserves on certain loans in that category between december  and december  during  reserve allocations increased for commercial and industrial loans  as well as construction and agricultural loans 
as with prior years  the significant reserve allocation for lease financing loans is the result of specific reserves allocated to a lease portfolio that has been nonperforming since and is in the process of litigation see discussion following 
increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans  construction loans  as well as agricultural loans  are the result of increases in special mention and substandard loans in those categories  with an increase in the volume of loans considered impaired 
successful re margining of a number of the company s problem loans during the third and fourth quarters of helped to reduce potential loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
during  reserve allocations increased significantly for commercial and industrial loans  construction loans  and to lesser extent  agricultural loans 
increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans  as well as agricultural loans are the result of increased loan volume  as well as increases in substandard loans in those categories 
increases in reserve allocations for construction loans are primarily the result of increases in special mention and substandard loans in those categories 
reserve allocations decreased for lease financing loans as a result of declining balances in the lease portfolio 
the company purchased a schedule of payments collateralized by surety bonds and lease payments in september that have a current balance owing of million plus interest 
the leases have been nonperforming since june see asset quality and allowance for credit losses section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in the company s annual report on form k 
for reporting purposes at december   the impaired lease portfolio was on non accrual status and had a specific allowance allocation of million  and a net carrying value of million 
during the first quarter of  the company evaluated its position with regard to the nonperforming lease portfolio  and determined that because the ultimate payoff of the lease portfolio would come from the underlying surety bonds rather than individual leases  the portfolio was better classified as a receivable to be included in other assets rather than classified as loans 
as a result  the company reclassified the net lease amount of million million in gross leases less million is specific reserve from loans to other assets effective january  all periods presented in this k for the period ended december  have been restated to reflect the transfer of the nonperforming lease portfolio from loans to other assets 
during june  the company agreed to settle with the insurance company issuing the surety bonds for a total settlement amount of million 
at june   the company increased the lease receivable classified in other assets to reflect the million settlement amount  and recorded a gain of  for the difference between the carrying amount previously recorded and the settlement amount 
the company received the proceeds from the settlement during july the following summarizes the company s allowance for credit losses related to the specific  formula  and unallocated reserves for the year ends shown december  dollars in s formula allowance specific allowance unallocated allowance total allowance at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and no unallocated allowance 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to real estate construction loans  and the remaining million    and  were allocated to commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate  installment loans  and agricultural loans  respectively 
the allowance for credit losses totaled million at december   and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated reserve 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to real estate construction loans  and the remaining million   and  were allocated to commercial and industrial loans  real estate commercial loans  and agricultural loans  respectively 
at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  and consisted of million in formula allowance  and  in specific allowance 
at december    of the specific allowance was allocated to real estate construction loans  and the remaining  and  were allocated to commercial and industrial loans  and leases  respectively 
the total formula allowance increased approximately  between and  primarily as the result of increased loss factors applied to pass loans which more than outweighed the decline in volume of pass loans 
between december  and december   sub substandard loans decreased million  while special mention loans decreased million  but the specific reserve increased million during the period as a result of deterioration in the impaired loan portfolio 
the total formula allowance decreased approximately  between and  primarily as the result of decreased volume in pass loans 
the formula allowance for construction loans decreased  during  but increased  and  for commercial real estate loans and agricultural loans  respectively  with only minor changes in other loan categories 
between december  and december   sub substandard loans increased million  while special mention and doubtful loans increased million and million  respectively 
increases in loan downgrades experienced during were primarily the result of continued deterioration in the overall economy  including the residential construction market  which in turn has impacted other sectors of the lending portfolio 
the total formula allowance increased approximately million between and  primarily as the result of increased volume in pass loans 
there were only minor formula allowance allocation changes between loan categories occurring between december  and december   and so most changes in the formula allowance during were the result of volume changes 
between december  and december   substandard loans increased million  while special mention and doubtful loans increased million and  million  respectively 
increases in loan downgrades experienced during were primarily the result of deteriorating economic factors in the residential construction market  which in turn has impacted other sectors of the lending portfolio 
although in some instances  the downgrading of a loan resulting from the factors used by the company in its allowance analysis has been reflected in the formula allowance  management believes that in some instances  the impact of material events and trends has not yet been reflected in the level of nonperforming loans or the internal risk grading process regarding these loans 
accordingly  the company s evaluation of probable losses related to these factors may be reflected in the unallocated allowance 
the evaluation of the inherent losses concerning these factors involve a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits  and therefore the company does not spread the unallocated allowance among segments of the portfolio 
at december  and december   the company had no unallocated allowance  while at december  the company had an unallocated allowance of  management s estimates of the unallocated allowance are based upon a number of underlying factors including the effect of deteriorating national and local economic trends  the effects of export market conditions on certain agricultural and manufacturing borrowers  the effects of abnormal weather patterns on agricultural borrowers  as well as other borrowers that may be impacted by such conditions  the effect of increased competition in the company s market area and the resultant potential impact of more relaxed underwriting standards to borrowers with multi bank relationships  the effect of soft real estate markets  and the effects of having a larger number of borrowing relationships which are close to the company s lending limit  any one if which were not to perform to contractual terms  would have a material impact on the allowance 
the company s loan portfolio has concentrations in commercial real estate  commercial  and construction loans  however the portfolio percentages fall within the company s loan policy guidelines 
it is the company s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on loans for which reasonable doubt exists with respect to the timely collectibility of interest or principal due to the inability of the borrower to comply with the terms of the loan agreement 
such loans are placed on nonaccrual status whenever the payment of principal or interest is days past due or earlier when the conditions warrant  and interest collected is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan 
management may grant exceptions to this policy if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands  except footnote nonaccrual loans restructured loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets loans  past due days or more  still accruing non performing loans to total gross loans non performing assets to total gross loans included in nonaccrual loans at december  and are restructured loans totaling million and  respectively 
there were no nonaccrual loans at december  which are restructured 
the interest income that would have been earned on nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  in accordance with their original terms is approximately million 
non performing assets have increased between december  and december  as the prolonged economic downturn continued into while nonaccrual loans decreased million between december  and december   restructured loans not included in the nonaccrual totals increased million as the company sought to work out problem credits with borrowers 
when all other means of repayment failed  the underlying collateral on nonperforming loans was foreclosed upon  resulting in the net increase of million in other real estate owned between december  and december  the net change in other real estate owned includes additions of approximately million in properties transferred from loans  and gross sales of nearly million during the year ended december  non performing assets increased between december  and december  as declines in real estate markets and related sectors experienced since the later part of resulting from lending problems continued to impact credit markets and the general economy throughout nonaccrual loans increased million between december  and december   with construction loans comprising approximately of total nonaccrual loans at december   and commercial and industrial loans comprising another 
non performing assets increased between december  and december as housing markets and related sectors experienced declines during the second half of the year as a result of sub prime lending problems which impacted credit markets and the overall economy worldwide 
economic conditions in the san joaquin valley remained strong during much of  although as a result of the decline in the housing sector and related real estate valuations  nonperforming assets increased during the years and additional charge offs were taken during the third and fourth quarters of non performing assets increased during  totaling of total loans at december  as compared to of total loans at december  non performing loans  a component of non performing assets  increased nearly million during primarily as the result of real estate construction and real estate development loans which become impaired during the period 
some  but not all  of these nonperforming real estate credits were outside the company s immediate market area  specifically southern california and the san francisco bay area

of the million in transfers between nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned during  million was transferred during the fourth quarter of increases in nonaccrual construction loans between december  and december  are the result of a significant slowdown in new housing starts and the resultant depreciation in land  and both partially completed and completed construction projects 
nonaccrual construction loans decreased million during the fourth quarter of  primarily as the result of construction loans that were transferred to other real estate owned 
as with impaired loans  a large percentage of nonaccrual loans were made for the purpose of residential construction  residential and commercial acquisition and development  and land development 
the following table summarizes nonaccrual balances by purpose at both december  and december  s december  december  residential construction residential and commercial acquisition and development land development other purposes total nonaccrual loans loans past due more than days are receiving increased management attention and are monitored for increased risk 
the company continues to move past due loans to nonaccrual status in its ongoing effort to recognize loan problems at an earlier point in time when they may be dealt with more effectively 
as impaired loans  nonaccrual and restructured loans are reviewed for specific reserve allocations and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly 
except for the loans included in the above table  and the land development loan discussed above  there were no loans at december  where the known credit problems of a borrower caused the company to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which would result in such loan being included as a nonaccrual  past due or restructured loan at some future date 
liquidity and asset liability management the primary function of asset liability management is to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity liquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on and off balance sheet financial obligations  including loan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals  without straining the company s equity structure 
to maintain an adequate liquidity position  the company relies on  in addition to cash and cash equivalents  cash inflows from deposits and short term borrowings  repayments of principal on loans and investments  and interest income received 
the company s principal cash outflows are for loan origination  purchases of investment securities  depositor withdrawals and payment of operating expenses 
other sources of liquidity not on the balance sheet at december  include unused collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit from other banks  the federal home loan bank  and from the federal reserve bank totaling million 
cash and cash equivalents have fluctuated during the three years ended december    and  with period end balances as follows from consolidated statements of cash flows in s balance december  december  december  december  cash and cash equivalents increased million during the year ended december   as compared to a decrease of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has maintained positive cash flows from operations over the past three years  which amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company experienced net cash inflows from investing activities totaling million during the year ended december   as the company experienced maturities of investment securities and interest bearing deposits with other banks  as well as net decreases in loans 
the company experienced net cash outflows from investing activities totaling million during the year ended december   as purchases of investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks exceeded net loan payoffs and maturities of investment securities during the period 
the company experienced net cash outflows from investing activities totaling million during the year ended december  as loan growth has exceeded net maturities of investment securities as well as other investment instruments during the year 
net cash flows from financing activities  including deposit growth and borrowings  have traditionally provided funding sources for loan growth  but during   and the company experienced net cash outflows totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
the cash outflows experienced during were primarily the result of planned reductions in outstand borrowings which exceeded increases in deposit accounts 
during and declines in net deposit accounts  as well as repurchases of the company s common stock  exceeded growth in financing categories  including borrowings 
the company has the ability to decrease loan growth  increase deposits and borrowings  or a combination of both to manage balance sheet liquidity 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility the company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or the company may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the company maintains a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk 
the policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  sets wholesale funding limits  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements  which comply with regulatory guidance 
the liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a monthly basis to the board of directors 
the policy also includes a contingency funding plan to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial market crisis 
in addition to unused lines of credit from other banks totaling million  the contingency plan includes identified funding sources  and steps that may be taken in the event the total liquidity ratio falls or is projected to fall below policy limits for any extended period of time 
one of the primary directives of the contingency funding plan is to limit the company s overall level of wholesale funding to no more than of deposits 
the current funding program uses both asset based and liability based principles  and identifies core deposits as the favored funding source when attainable at a reasonable cost 
the policy identifies a number of funding sources or methods the bank alco committee may utilize to fulfill the company s liquidity funding requirements local core deposits are the company s primary funding source 
the company must expand its efforts to attract these deposits through service related and competitive pricing tactics 
other liquidity funding sources should only be consider of local core deposits are not attractive because of maturity or pricing 
unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks may be used to fund short term peaks in loan demand or deposit run off 
currently  unsecured borrowing lines with correspondents are limited and may not be reliable for long periods of time or in times of economic stress 
other funding sources such as secured credit lines with the federal home loan bank or the federal reserve may be used for longer periods 
the company collateralizes these available lines with a combination of investment securities and pledged loans 
the company has utilized specific loan pledging with both the fhlb and the federal reserve to better ensure the continued availability of those lines of credit 
the company presently has a discount window facility available from the federal reserve bank of san francisco collateralized with loans as discussed above 
at december  the company had available credit of million from the federal reserve based upon the loans pledged at that date 
the federal reserve will monitor use of the discount window closely given the current status of the company and the economy as a whole and 
in addition  this credit facility may not be competitively priced under normal economic conditions 
as such  the company does not expect to use this facility except in times of crises  but does consider this to be a key contingency funding source 
as long as the bank remains well capitalized the company may rely on brokered deposits when core deposit rates are higher in the marketplace or maturity structures are not desirable 
the company s current policy limit for brokered deposits is of total deposits 
the company may also utilize other wholesale deposit sources such as memberships that advertise the bank s time deposit rates to other subscribers  typically banks and credit unions 
the company s current policy limit on other wholesale deposits is of total deposits 
the bank may sell whole loans or participations in loans to provide additional liquidity 
during economic downturns or other crises events  these funding sources may be difficult to achieve in a short period of time or at a reasonable price 
as such  this strategy is better used as a long term asset liability management tool to effectively balance assets and liabilities to reduce liquidity risk 
the company currently has bank owned life insurance boli policies issued by highly rated insurance companies which may be sold to increase liquidity 
the company owns certain real estate including its administration building and several of its branches 
these may be sold and vacated or leased back from the purchaser after sale to provide additional liquidity if needed 
the sales process may require substantial time to complete  and may have an adverse impact on earnings depending on market rates and other factors at the time of sale 
investments near maturity may be sold to meet temporary funding needs but may need to be replaced to maintain liquidity ratios within acceptable limits 
at the current time much of the investment portfolio is pledged to secure public deposits and borrowing lines 
as wholesale funding dependence is reduced  the available liquidity in the investment portfolio will increase 
the company seeks to maintain an investment grade securities portfolio to ensure quality collateral for pledging against borrowing lines of credit as well as to provide liquidity in times of needs 
the company continues to utilize liability management  when needed  as part of its overall asset liability management strategy 
through the discretionary acquisition of short term borrowings  the company has been able to provide liquidity to fund asset growth while  at the same time  better utilizing its capital resources  and better controlling interest rate risk 
the borrowings are generally short term and more closely match the repricing characteristics of floating rate loans  which comprise approximately of the company s loan portfolio at december  this does not preclude the company from selling assets such as investment securities to fund liquidity needs but  with favorable borrowing rates  the company has maintained a positive yield spread between borrowed liabilities and the assets which those liabilities fund 
if  at some time  rate spreads become unfavorable  the company has the ability to utilize an asset management approach and  either control asset growth or  fund further growth with maturities or sales of investment securities 
the company s liquid asset base which generally consists of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos and investment securities  is maintained at a level deemed sufficient to provide the cash outlay necessary to fund loan growth as well as any customer deposit runoff that may occur 
within this framework is the objective of maximizing the yield on earning assets 
this is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans  which historically have represented the company s highest yielding asset 
at december   the bank had of total assets in the loan portfolio and a loan to deposit ratio of 
liquid assets at december  include cash and cash equivalents totaling million as compared to million at december  liabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non core deposits as well as short term borrowings 
core deposits  which comprise approximately of total deposits at december   provide a significant and stable funding source for the company 
at december   unused lines of credit with the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank totaling million are collateralized in part by certain qualifying loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the carrying value of loans pledged on these used and unused borrowing lines totaled million at december  for further discussion of the company s borrowing lines  see short term borrowings included in previously in the financial condition section of this financial review 
the federal reserve board has notified the bank that it will permit the bank to draw on its line of credit with the federal reserve bank only in limited circumstances and for a short duration 
the liquidity of the parent company  united security bancshares  is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  united security bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
the bank currently has limited ability to pay dividends or make capital distributions see regulatory agreement section included in regulatory matters of this management s discussion 
the limited ability of the bank to pay dividends may impact the ability of the company to fund its ongoing liquidity requirements including ongoing operating expenses  as well as quarterly interest payments on the company s junior subordinated debt trust preferred securities 
under an agreement with the federal reserve dated march   the bank is precluded from paying a cash dividend to the company 
to conserve cash and capital resources  the company elected at september  to defer the payment of interest on its junior subordinated debt beginning with the quarterly payment due october  the company has not determined how long it will defer interest payments  but under the terms of the debenture  interest payments may be deferred up to five years quarters 
during such deferral periods  the company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock subject to certain exceptions and will continue to accrue interest payable on the junior subordinated debt 
during the year ended december   cash dividends paid by the bank to the parent company totaled  contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   the company s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date

regulatory matters regulatory agreement effective march   united security bancshares the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  united security bank the bank  entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
under the terms of the agreement  the company and the bank agreed  among other things  to strengthen board oversight of management and the bank s operations  submit an enhanced written plan to strengthen credit risk management practices and improve the bank s position on the past due loans  classified loans  and other real estate owned  maintain a sound process for determining  documenting  and recording an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  improve the management of the bank s liquidity position and funds management policies  maintain sufficient capital at the company and bank level  and improve the bank s earnings and overall condition 
the company and bank have also agreed not to increase or guarantee any debt  purchase or redeem any shares of stock  declare or pay any cash dividends  or pay interest on the company s junior subordinated debt or trust preferred securities  without prior written approval from the federal reserve bank 
this agreement was a result of a regulatory examination that was conducted by the federal reserve and the california department of financial institutions in june  and relates primarily to the bank s asset quality 
progress on these items has been made since the completion of the examination and management and the board are committed to resolving all of the items addressed by the federal reserve in the agreement 
both the company and the bank will submit quarterly written progress reports to the federal reserve bank 
the company and the bank have also received notification from the california department of financial institutions of their intention to issue a regulatory order as a result of the june regulatory examination 
the company and the bank have not yet entered into an agreement with the california department of financial institutions  but believe that any agreement entered into  will be similar to the current agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
capital adequacy capital adequacy for bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks has become increasingly important in recent years 
continued deregulation of the banking industry since the s has resulted in  among other things  a broadening of business activities allowed beyond that of traditional banking products and services 
because of this volatility within the banking and financial services industry  regulatory agencies have increased their focus upon ensuring that banking institutions meet certain capital requirements as a means of protecting depositors and investors against such volatility 
during july  the company redeemed its million in trust preferred securities originally issued during under united security bancshares capital trust i 
during the same month  the company issued million in new trust preferred securities with similar terms under newly formed united security bancshares capital trust ii 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital up to a maximum of of tier capital 
any additional portion will qualify as tier capital 
as shareholders equity increases  the amount of tier capital that can be comprised of trust preferred securities will increase 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system board of governors has adopted regulations requiring insured institutions to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus intangible assets  identified losses and investments in certain subsidiaries  plus unrealized losses or minus unrealized gains on available for sale securities to total assets 
institutions which have received the highest composite regulatory rating and which are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier capital to total assets 
to be considered well capitalized  the institution must maintain a leverage capital ratio of 
all other institutions are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum requirements 
the board of governors has also adopted a statement of policy  supplementing its leverage capital ratio requirements  which provides definitions of qualifying total capital consisting of tier capital and tier supplementary capital  including the allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets and sets forth minimum risk based capital ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
the most highly rated insured institutions are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital 
to be considered well capitalized  institutions must maintain a ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital 
the bank has agreed with the california department of financial institutions  to maintain tier i capital and leverage ratios that are at or in excess of 
in addition  the bank has agreed to maintain total risk based capital ratios at or in excess of at or above well capitalized levels as defined 
the company is not subject to well capitalized guidelines under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions

dividends dividends paid to shareholders by the company are subject to restrictions set forth in the california general corporation law 
the california general corporation law provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payout are at least equal the amount of the proposed distribution 
the primary source of funds with which dividends will be paid to shareholders will come from cash dividends received by the company from the bank 
as noted earlier  the company and the bank have entered into an agreement with the federal reserve bank that  among other things  require us to obtain the prior approval before paying a cash dividend or otherwise making a distribution on our stock 
in addition  the company has elected to defer regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with its trust preferred securities 
the company is prohibited from paying any dividends or making any other distribution on its common stock for so long as interest payments are being deferred 
during the year ended december   the company received  in cash dividends from the bank 
during the same period  the company paid  in cash dividends to shareholders representing cash in lieu amounts paid in connection quarterly stock dividends 
the bank as a state chartered bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth in california state banking law  and administered by the california commissioner of financial institutions commissioner 
under such restrictions  the bank may not pay cash dividends in an amount which exceeds the lesser of the retained earnings of the bank or the bank s net income for the last three fiscal years less the amount of distributions to shareholders during that period of time 
if the above test is not met  cash dividends may only be paid with the prior approval of the commissioner  in an amount not exceeding the bank s net income for its last fiscal year or the amount of its net income for the current fiscal year 
such restrictions do not apply to stock dividends  which generally require neither the satisfaction of any tests nor the approval of the commissioner 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if the commissioner finds that the shareholders equity is not adequate or that the declarations of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound  the commissioner may order the state bank not to pay any dividend 
the frb may also limit dividends paid by the bank 
as noted above  the terms of the regulatory agreement with the federal reserve prohibit both the company and the bank from paying dividends without prior approval of the federal reserve

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity and market risk an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or is subject to interest rate adjustments as market rates of interest change 
interest rate sensitivity is the measure of the volatility of earnings from movements in market rates of interest  which is generally reflected in interest rate spread 
as interest rates change in the market place  yields earned on assets do not necessarily move in tandem with interest rates paid on liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is related to liquidity in that each is affected by maturing assets and sources of funds 
interest rate sensitivity is also affected by assets and liabilities with interest rates that are subject to change prior to maturity 
the object of interest rate sensitivity management is to minimize the impact on earnings from interest rate changes in the marketplace 
in recent years  deregulation  causing liabilities to become more interest rate sensitive  combined with interest rate volatility in the capital markets  has placed additional emphasis on this principal 
when management decides to maintain repricing imbalances  it usually does so on the basis of a well conceived strategy designed to ensure that the risk is not excessive and that liquidity is properly maintained 
the company s interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the asset liability management committee alco  which reports to the board of directors on a periodic basis  pursuant to established operating policies and procedures 
as part of its overall risk management  the company pursues various asset and liability management strategies  which may include obtaining derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest fluctuations on the company s net interest margin 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into a five year amortizing interest rate swap agreement with the purpose of minimizing interest rate fluctuations on its interest rate margin and equity 
the interest rate swap agreement matured on september  interest rate risk can be measured through various methods including gap  duration and market value analysis as well as income simulation models  which provides a dynamic view of interest rate sensitivity based on the assumptions of the company s management 
the company employs each of these methods and refines these processes to make the most accurate measurements possible 
the information provided by these calculations is the basis for management decisions in managing interest rate risk 
from the gap report below  the company is apparently subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its assets have the potential to reprice more quickly than its liabilities within the next year 
at december   the company had a cumulative month gap of million or of total earning assets 
management believes the gap analysis shown below is not entirely indicative of the company s actual interest rate sensitivity  because certain interest sensitive assets and liabilities would not reprice to the same degree as the change in underlying market rates 
approximately million of the floating rate loans included in the million immediately adjustable category have rate floors and would only change to some degree if any  depending on the magnitude of changes in market rates 
of the million in floating rate loans with rate floors  approximately million have floors more than basis points above the current loan index rate  and thus rates on those loans would not change for the first basis point increase in market rates 
interest bearing checking and savings accounts which are also included in the immediately adjustable column probably would move only a portion of the total change in market rates and  in fact  might not even move at all 
the effects of market value risk have been mitigated to some degree by the makeup of the bank s balance sheet 
loans are generally short term or are floating rate instruments 
at december   million or of the loan portfolio matures or reprices within one year  and less than of the portfolio matures or reprices in more than years 
total investment securities including call options and prepayment assumptions  have a combined duration of approximately years 
more than million or of interest bearing liabilities mature or can be repriced within the next months  even though the rate elasticity of deposits with no defined maturities may not necessarily be the same as interest earning assets 
the following table sets forth the company s gap  or estimated interest rate sensitivity profile based on ending balances as of december   representing the interval of time before earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may respond to changes in market rates of interest 
assets and liabilities are categorized by remaining interest rate maturities rather than by principal maturities of obligations

see above for discussion of the impact of floating rate cd s 
the company utilizes a vendor purchased simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on a   and basis point rise and a   and basis point fall in interest rates ramped over a twelve month period  with net interest impacts projected out as far as twenty four months 
in addition  a most likely scenario is projected based upon expected rate changes over the month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment of certain assets and liabilities 
projected net interest income is calculated assuming customers will reinvest maturing deposit accounts and the company will originate new loans 
the balance sheet growth assumptions utilized correspond closely to the company s strategic growth plans and annual budget 
excess cash is invested in overnight funds or other short term investments such as us treasuries 
cash shortfalls are covered through additional borrowing of overnight or short term funds 
the board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum decreases in net interest income of and in the event of a bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates over a twelve month period 
based on the information and assumptions utilized in the simulation model at december  the resultant projected impact on net interest income falls within policy limits set by the board of directors for all rate scenarios simulated 
the company also utilizes the same vendor purchased simulation model to project the impact of changes in interest rates on the underlying market value of all the company s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet accounts under alternative interest rate scenarios 
the resultant net value  as impacted under each projected interest rate scenario  is referred to as the market value of equity mv of equity 
this technique captures the interest rate risk of the company s business mix across all maturities 
the market analysis is performed using an immediate rate shock of   and basis points up and down calculating the present value of expected cash flows under each rate environment at applicable discount rates 
the market value of loans is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows over either the term to maturity for fixed rate loans or scheduled repricing for floating rate loans using the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings 
the market value of investment securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from reliable independent brokers 
the market value of time deposits is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows using current rates for similar instruments of comparable maturities 
the market value of deposits with no defined maturities  including interest bearing checking  money market and savings accounts is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows at a rate equal to the difference between the cost of these deposits and the alternate use of the funds  federal funds in this case 
assumed maturities for these deposits are estimated using decay analysis and are generally assumed to have implied maturities of less than five years 
for noninterest sensitive assets and liabilities  the market value is equal to their carrying value amounts at the reporting date 
the company s interest rate risk policy establishes maximum decreases in the company s market value of equity of and in the event of an immediate and sustained bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates 
as shown in the table below  the percentage changes in the net market value of the company s equity are within policy limits for both rising and falling rate scenarios 
the following sets forth the analysis of the company s market value risk inherent in its interest sensitive financial instruments as they relate to the entire balance sheet at december  and december  in thousands 
fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with absolute precision 
assumptions have been made as to the appropriate discount rates  prepayment speeds  expected cash flows and other variables 
changes in these assumptions significantly affect the estimates and as such  the obtained fair value may not be indicative of the value negotiated in the actual sale or liquidation of such financial instruments  nor comparable to that reported by other financial institutions 
in addition  fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate future business
