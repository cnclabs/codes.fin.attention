industry overview historically  the ems industry experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design  manufacturing  and distribution requirements 
following the technology downturn  we saw an increase in penetration of global oem manufacturing requirements as more and more oems pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing 
due to the global economic crisis  which began in late calendar year and continued through the end of our fiscal year  many of our oem customers reduced their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing which negatively impacted our business 
beginning in the second half of our fiscal year  we began seeing some positive signs that demand for our oem customers end products was improving 
we believe the long term  future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities  design and engineering services  component and product solutions  and after market services remain strong 
the total available market for outsourcing electronics manufacturing services continues to offer opportunities for growth with current penetration rates estimated to be less than 
the intensely competitive nature of the electronics industry  the continually increasing complexity and sophistication of electronics products  pressure on oems to reduce product costs  and shorter product life cycles encourage oems to utilize broad service ems providers as part of their business and manufacturing strategies 
utilizing ems providers allows oems to take advantage of the global design  manufacturing and supply chain management expertise of ems providers  and 
table of contents enables oems to concentrate on product research  development  marketing and sales 
we believe that oems realize the following benefits through their strategic relationships with ems providers reduced production costs  reduced design and development costs and lead time  accelerated time to market and time to volume production  reduced capital investment requirements and fixed costs  improved inventory management and purchasing power  access to worldwide design  engineering  manufacturing  and after market service capabilities  and ability to focus on core branding and r d initiatives

component businesses 
the company offers a variety of component product solutions including printed circuit board pcb and flexible circuit fabrication 
printed circuit boards are platforms composed of laminated materials that provide the interconnection for integrated circuits  passive and other electronic components and thus are at the heart of most every electrical system 
they are formed out of laminated  flame retardant and multi layered epoxy resin systems with very fine traces and spaces and plated holes called vias  which interconnect the different layers to an extreme dense circuitry network that carries the integrated circuits and electrical signals 
semiconductor designs are currently so complex that they often require printed circuit boards with multiple layers of narrow  densely spaced wiring or flexible circuits 
as semiconductor designs become more and more complex and signal speeds increase  there is an increased demand on printed circuit board integration density requiring higher layer counts  finer lines  smaller vias microvias and base materials with electrically very low loss characteristics 
the manufacture of these complex multilayer interconnect and flexible circuit products often requires the use of sophisticated circuit interconnections between layers  and adherence to strict electrical characteristics to maintain consistent circuit transmission speeds 
the global demand for wireless devices and the complexity of wireless products are driving the demand for more flexible printed circuits 
flexible circuit board facilitates a reduction in the weight of a finished electronic product and allows the designer to use the third dimension in designing new products or product features 
flexible circuits have become a very attractive design alternative for many new and emerging application spaces such as automotive rear led lightning  tablet computers  camera modules and miniaturized radio frequency identification tags or smart cards

we implement programs  including compliance audits and compliance capability building programs  that focus on driving continuous improvements in social  ethical  and environmental compliance throughout all of our global operating units in accordance with our code of conduct 
as a guide to achieve this end  flextronics looks at principles  policies  and standards as prescribed by the electronics industry citizenship coalition eicc  a worldwide association of electronics companies committed to promoting an industry code of conduct for global electronics supply chains to improve working and environmental conditions 
flextronics is a founding member of the eicc coalition 
being a good corporate citizen does not mean that we should merely conform to the standards 
we extend beyond meeting responsibilities by offering a wide range of programs and initiatives that engage our internal and external communities 
at the heart of this endeavor lies our pragmatic goal of creating a difference to the people in the community in which we operate 
we intend to continue to invest in these global communities through grant making  financial contributions  volunteer work  support programs and by donating resources 
employees as of march   our global workforce totaled approximately  employees 
in certain international locations  our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils 
we have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike  and we believe that our employee relations are good 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business  results of operations and business prospects 
to date  we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel 
environmental regulation our operations are regulated under various federal  state  local and international laws governing the environment  including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
we have infrastructures in place to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations 
we do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  operating results  or competitive position 
in addition  we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites 
we engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities of our ongoing operations  historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements 
we determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the range of possible costs in light of information currently available 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
while no material exposures have been identified to date that we are aware of  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known 
we are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances 
for example  the electronics industry became subject to the european union s restrictions on hazardous substances rohs  waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directives  the regulation ec eu directive reach regulation  evaluation  authorization  and restriction of chemicals  and china rohs entitled  management methods for controlling pollution for electronic information products eips 
similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions  including in the united states 
our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risk of non compliance 
we have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to 
table of contents meet the needs of our customers as well as the regulations 
these programs vary from collecting compliance data from our suppliers to full laboratory testing  and we require our supply chain to comply 
non compliance could potentially result in significant costs and or penalties 
rohs and other similar legislation prohibits the use of lead  mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and weee requires eu importers and or producers to assume responsibility for the collection  recycling and management of waste electronic products and components 
in the case of weee  although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the eu importers and or producers rather than with ems companies  oems may turn to ems companies for assistance in meeting their weee obligations 
intellectual property we own or license various united states and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies 
for certain of our proprietary processes  we rely on trade secret protection 
we also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the united states and other countries throughout the world 
as of march  and  the carrying value of our intellectual property was immaterial 
although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it  we cannot assure you that third parties will not make infringement claims against us in the future 
in addition  we are increasingly providing design and engineering services to our customers and designing and making our own products 
as a consequence of these activities  we are required to address and allocate the ownership and responsibility for intellectual property in our customer relationships to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses 
if a third party were to make an assertion regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property  we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation 
such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor 
additionally  litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome 
we also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re perform design services
