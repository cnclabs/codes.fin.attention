we maintain a diversified portfolio of long term healthcare facilities and mortgages on healthcare facilities located throughout the united states 
in making investments  we generally have focused on established  creditworthy  middle market healthcare operators that meet our standards for quality and experience of management 
we have sought to diversify our investments in terms of geographic locations and operators 
in evaluating potential investments and future returns  we consider such factors as the quality and experience of management and the creditworthiness of the operator of the facility  the facility s historical and forecasted cash flow and its ability to meet operational needs  capital expenditure requirements and lease or debt service obligations  the construction quality  condition and design of the facility  the geographic area of the facility  the tax  growth  regulatory and reimbursement environment of the jurisdiction in which the facility is located  the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities  and the payor mix of private  medicare and medicaid patients 

table of contents one of our fundamental investment strategies is to obtain contractual rent escalations under long term  non cancelable  triple net leases and fixed rate mortgage loans  and to obtain substantial liquidity deposits 
additional security is typically provided by covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth  liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets  and various provisions for cross default  cross collateralization and corporate personal guarantees  when appropriate 
we prefer to invest in equity ownership of properties 
due to regulatory  tax or other considerations  we may pursue alternative investment structures  which can achieve returns comparable to equity investments 
the following summarizes the primary investment structures we typically use 
the average annualized yields described below reflect existing contractual arrangements 
however  in view of the ongoing financial challenges in the long term care industry  we cannot assure you that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment obligations in full or when due 
therefore  the annualized yields as of january  set forth below are not necessarily indicative of or a forecast of actual yields  which may be lower 
purchase leaseback 
in a purchase leaseback transaction  we purchase the property from the operator and lease it back to the operator over terms typically ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
the leases originated by us generally provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual formula increases based upon such factors as increases in the consumer price index cpi 
the average annualized yield from leases was approximately at january  fixed rate mortgage 
these mortgages have a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term and are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
the average annualized yield on these investments was approximately at january  the table set forth in item properties contains information regarding our real estate properties  their geographic locations  and the types of investment structures as of december  borrowing policies 
we may incur additional indebtedness and have historically sought to maintain an annualized total debt to ebitda ratio in the range of to times 
we intend to periodically review our policy with respect to our total debt to ebitda ratio and to modify the policy as our management deems prudent in light of prevailing market conditions 
our strategy generally has been to match the maturity of our indebtedness with the maturity of our investment assets and to employ long term  fixed rate debt to the extent practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time 
we may use proceeds of any additional indebtedness to provide permanent financing for investments in additional healthcare facilities 
we may obtain either secured or unsecured indebtedness and may obtain indebtedness that may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock 
where debt financing is available on terms deemed favorable  we generally may invest in properties subject to existing loans  secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens on properties 
if we need capital to repay indebtedness as it matures  we may be required to liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of the maximum recovery on these investments 
this could also result in adverse tax consequences to us 
we may be required to issue additional equity interests in our company  which could dilute your investment in our company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
policies with respect to certain activities 
if our board of directors determines that additional funding is required  we may raise such funds through additional equity offerings  debt financing  and retention of cash flow subject to provisions in the internal revenue code concerning taxability of undistributed reit taxable income or a combination of these methods 
borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured or unsecured  and publicly or privately placed debt instruments  purchase money obligations to the sellers of assets  long term  tax exempt bonds or financing from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  or securitizations  any of which indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our assets 
holders of such indebtedness may have recourse to all or any part of our assets or may be limited to the particular asset to which the indebtedness relates 
we have authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future 
subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for reit qualification  we may invest in securities of other reits  other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers  including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities 

table of contents we may engage in the purchase and sale of investments 
we do not underwrite the securities of other issuers 
our officers and directors may change any of these policies without a vote of our stockholders 
in the opinion of our management  our properties are adequately covered by insurance 
competition 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive and will likely become more competitive in the future 
we face competition from other reits  investment companies  private equity and hedge fund investors  healthcare operators  lenders  developers and other institutional investors  some of whom have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us 
our operators compete on a local and regional basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable services 
the basis of competition for our operators includes the quality of care provided  reputation  the physical appearance of a facility  price  the range of services offered  family preference  alternatives for healthcare delivery  the supply of competing properties  physicians  staff  referral sources  location and the size and demographics of the population and surrounding areas 
increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives 
our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends  availability of investment alternatives  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  existing laws and regulations  new legislation and population trends

taxation the following is a general summary of the material us federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to the holders of our securities and our election to be taxed as a reit 
it is not tax advice 
the summary is not intended to represent a detailed description of the us federal income tax consequences applicable to a particular stockholder in view of any person s particular circumstances  nor is it intended to represent a detailed description of the us federal income tax consequences applicable to stockholders subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws such as insurance companies  tax exempt organizations  financial institutions  securities broker dealers  investors in pass through entities  expatriates and taxpayers subject to alternative minimum taxation 
the following discussion  to the extent it constitutes matters of law or legal conclusions assuming the facts  representations  and assumptions upon which the discussion is based are accurate  accurately represents some of the material us federal income tax considerations relevant to ownership of our securities 
the sections of the internal revenue code the code relating to the qualification and operation as a reit are highly technical and complex 
the following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of the code sections that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its stockholders 
the information in this section is based on the code  current  temporary  and proposed treasury regulations promulgated under the code  the legislative history of the code  current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service irs  and court decisions  in each case  as of the date of this report 
in addition  the administrative interpretations and practices of the irs include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings  which are not binding on the irs  except with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings 
general 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit  under sections through of the code  beginning with our taxable year ended december  we believe that we have been organized and operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit 
we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to maintain our qualification as a reit  but no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 
the sections of the code that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit are highly technical and complex 
the following sets forth certain material aspects of those sections 
this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions  rules and regulations promulgated thereunder  and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 
if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders 
however  we will be subject to certain federal income taxes as follows first  we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed reit taxable income  including undistributed net capital gains  provided  however  that if we have a net capital gain  we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on our undistributed reit taxable income  computed without regard to net capital gain and the deduction for capital gains dividends  plus a tax on undistributed net capital gain  if our tax as thus computed is less than the tax computed in the regular manner 
second  under certain circumstances  we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference that we do not distribute or allocate to our stockholders 
third  if we have i net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property  which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  or ii other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property  we will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate on such income 
fourth  if we have net income from prohibited transactions which are  in general  certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business by us  ie  when we are acting as a dealer  such income will be subject to a tax 
fifth  if we should fail to satisfy the gross income test or the gross income test as discussed below  but have nonetheless maintained our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements have been met  we will be subject to a tax on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail the or test  multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
sixth  if we should fail to distribute by the end of each year at least the sum of i of our reit ordinary income for such year  ii of our reit capital gain net income for such year  and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods  we will be subject to a excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed 
seventh  we will be subject to a excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary trs that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
eighth  if we acquire any asset  which is defined as a built in gain asset from a c corporation that is not a reit ie  generally a corporation subject to full corporate level tax in a transaction in which the basis of the built in gain asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset or any other property in the hands of the c corporation  and we recognize gain on the disposition of such asset during the year period  which is defined as the recognition period  beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by us  then  to the extent of the built in gain ie  the excess of a the fair market value of such asset on the date such asset was acquired by us over b our adjusted basis in such asset on such date  our recognized gain will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate 
the results described above with respect to the recognition of built in gain assume that we will not make an election pursuant to treasury regulations section d c 

table of contents requirements for qualification 
the code defines a reit as a corporation  trust or association which is managed by one or more trustees or directors  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares  or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  which would be taxable as a domestic corporation  but for sections through of the code  which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to the provisions of the code  the beneficial ownership of which is held by or more persons  during the last half year of each taxable year not more than in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities  and which meets certain other tests  described below  regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its annual distributions to stockholders 
the code provides that conditions to  inclusive  must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition must be met during at least days of a taxable year of twelve months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than twelve months 
for purposes of conditions and  pension funds and certain other tax exempt entities are treated as individuals  subject to a look through exception in the case of condition 
income tests 
to maintain our qualification as a reit  we annually must satisfy two gross income requirements 
first  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including generally rents from real property  interest on mortgages on real property  and gains on sale of real property and real property mortgages  other than property described in section a of the code and income derived from certain types of temporary investments 
second  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from such real property investments  dividends  interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities other than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
rents received by us will qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if several conditions are met 
first  the amount of the rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  any amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term rents from real property solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 
second  the code provides that rents received from a tenant other than rent from a tenant that is a trs that meets the requirements described below will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests if we  or an owner actually or constructively of or more of the value of our stock  actually or constructively owns or more of such tenant  which is defined as a related party tenant 
third  if rent attributable to personal property  leased in connection with a lease of real property  is greater than of the total rent received under the lease  then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property 
finally  for rents received to qualify as rents from real property  we generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property  other than through an independent contractor from which we derive no revenue 
we may  however  directly perform certain services that are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property 
in addition  we may provide a minimal amount of non customary services to the tenants of a property  other than through an independent contractor  as long as our income from the services does not exceed of our income from the related property 
furthermore  we may own up to of the stock of a trs  which may provide customary and non customary services to our tenants without tainting our rental income from the related properties 
for our tax years beginning after  rents for customary services performed by a trs or that are received from a trs and are described in code section b no longer need to meet the excise tax safe harbor 
instead  such payments avoid the excise tax if we pay the trs at least of its direct cost of furnishing such services 
beginning in  we were allowed to include as qualified rents from real property rental income that is paid to us by a trs with respect to a lease of a health care facility to the trs provided that the facility is operated and managed by an eligible independent contractor  although none of our facilities were leased to any of our trss 

table of contents the term interest generally does not include any amount received or accrued directly or indirectly if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term interest solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or sales 
in addition  an amount that is based on the income or profits of a debtor will be qualifying interest income as long as the debtor derives substantially all of its income from the real property securing the debt from leasing substantially all of its interest in the property  but only to the extent that the amounts received by the debtor would be qualifying rents from real property if received directly by a reit 
if a loan contains a provision that entitles us to a percentage of the borrower s gain upon the sale of the real property securing the loan or a percentage of the appreciation in the property s value as of a specific date  income attributable to that loan provision will be treated as gain from the sale of the property securing the loan  which generally is qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests 
interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property generally is qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
however  if the highest principal amount of a loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to originate or acquire the loan  a portion of the interest income from such loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but will be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
the portion of the interest income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test will be equal to the portion of the principal amount of the loan that is not secured by real property 
prohibited transactions 
we will incur a tax on the net income derived from any sale or other disposition of property  other than foreclosure property  that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
we believe that none of our assets is primarily held for sale to customers and that a sale of any of our assets would not be in the ordinary course of our business 
whether a reit holds an asset primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends  however  on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time  including those related to a particular asset 
nevertheless  we will attempt to comply with the terms of safe harbor provisions in the federal income tax laws prescribing when an asset sale will not be characterized as a prohibited transaction 
the code also provides a number of alternative exceptions from the tax on prohibited transactions if certain requirements have been satisfied with respect to property disposed of by the reit 
these requirements relate primarily to the number and or amount of properties disposed of by the reit  the period of time the property has been held by the reit  and or aggregate expenditures made by the reit with respect to the property being disposed of 
the conditions needed to meets these requirements have been lowered for taxable years beginning in however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with the safe harbor provisions or that we will be able to avoid the tax on prohibited transactions if we were to dispose of an owned property that otherwise may be characterized as property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
foreclosure property 
we will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on any income from foreclosure property  other than income that otherwise would be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  less expenses directly connected with the production of that income 
however  gross income from foreclosure property is treated as qualifying for purposes of the and gross income tests 
foreclosure property is any real property  including interests in real property  and any personal property incident to such real property that is acquired by a reit as the result of i the reit having bid on such property at foreclosure  or having otherwise reduced such property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law  after there was a default  or ii default was imminent on a lease of such property or on indebtedness that such property secured  for which the related loan or lease was acquired by the reit at a time when the default was not imminent or anticipated  and for which the reit makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property 
such property generally ceases to be foreclosure property at the end of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which the reit acquired the property  or longer for a total of up to six years if an extension is granted by the secretary of the treasury 
in the case of a qualified health care property acquired solely as a result of termination of a lease  but not in connection with default or an imminent default on the lease  the initial grace period terminates on the second rather than third taxable year following the year in which the reit acquired the property unless the reit establishes the need for and the secretary of the treasury grants one or more extension  not exceeding six years in total including the original two year period  to provide for the orderly leasing or liquidation of the reit s interest in the qualified health care property 
this grace period terminates and foreclosure property ceases to be foreclosure property on the first day 
table of contents on which a lease is entered into for the property that  by its terms  will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the gross income test  or any amount is received or accrued  directly or indirectly  pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day that will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the gross income test  on which any construction takes place on the property  other than completion of a building or any other improvement  where more than of the construction was completed before default became imminent  or which is more than days after the day on which the reit acquired the property and the property is used in a trade or business which is conducted by the reit  other than through an independent contractor from whom the reit itself does not derive or receive any income 
in july  we assumed operating responsibilities for the properties due to the bankruptcy of haven eldercare  llc haven facilities one of our operators tenants  as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations portfolio and other developments 
in september  we entered into an agreement to lease these facilities to a new operator tenant 
effective september   the new operator tenant assumed operating responsibility for of the facilities 
we are in the process of addressing state regulatory requirements necessary to transfer the final two properties to the new operator tenant  and as a result  we retained operating responsibility for two properties as of december  we made an election on our federal income tax return to treat the haven facilities as foreclosure properties 
because we acquired possession in connection with a foreclosure  the haven facilities are eligible to be treated as foreclosure property until the end of although the secretary of treasury may extend the foreclosure property period until the end of  there can be no assurance that we will receive such an extension 
so long as the two remaining haven facilities qualify as foreclosure property  our gross income from the properties will be qualifying income for the and gross income tests  but we will generally be subject to corporate income tax at the highest rate on the net income from the properties 
if the two remaining haven facilities were to inadvertently fail to qualify as foreclosure property  we would likely recognize nonqualifying income from such property for purposes of the and gross income tests  which could cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
in addition  any gain from a sale of such property could be subject to the prohibited transactions tax 
although we intend to sell or lease the remaining haven facilities to one or more unrelated third parties prior to the end of  no assurance can be provided that we will accomplish that objective 
since the year  the definition of foreclosure property has included any qualified health care property  as defined in code section e acquired by us as the result of the termination or expiration of a lease of such property 
we have from time to time operated qualified healthcare facilities acquired in this manner for up to two years or longer if an extension was granted 
however  we do not currently own any property with respect to which we have made foreclosure property elections other than the remaining haven properties discussed in the prior paragraph 
properties that we had taken back in a foreclosure or bankruptcy and operated for our own account were treated as foreclosure properties for income tax purposes  pursuant to code section e 
gross income from foreclosure properties was classified as good income for purposes of the annual reit income tests upon making the election on the tax return 
once made  the income was classified as good for a period of three years  or until the properties were no longer operated for our own account 
in all cases of foreclosure property  we utilized an independent contractor to conduct day to day operations to maintain reit status 
in certain cases we operated these facilities through a taxable reit subsidiary 
for those properties operated through the taxable reit subsidiary  we utilized an eligible independent contractor to conduct day to day operations to maintain reit status 
as a result of the foregoing  we do not believe that our participation in the operation of nursing homes increased the risk that we would fail to qualify as a reit 
through our taxable year  we had not paid any tax on our foreclosure property because those properties had been producing losses 
we cannot predict whether  in the future  our income from foreclosure property will be significant and or whether we could be required to pay a significant amount of tax on that income 
hedging transactions 
from time to time  we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities 
our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps  caps and floors  options to purchase these items  and futures and forward contracts 
to the extent that we enter into an interest rate swap or cap contract  option  futures contract  forward rate agreement  or any similar financial instrument to hedge our indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets  any periodic income or gain from the disposition of that contract should be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but not the gross income test 
accordingly  our income and gain from our interest rate swap agreements generally is qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but not the gross income test 
to the extent that we hedge with other types of financial instruments  or in other situations  it is not entirely clear how the income from those transactions will be treated for purposes of the gross income tests 
we have structured and intend to continue to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a reit 
for tax years beginning after  we were no longer required to include income from hedging transactions in gross income ie  not included in either the numerator or the denominator for purposes of the gross income test and we are no longer required to include in gross income ie  not included in either the numerator or the denominator for purposes of the gross income test any gross income from any hedging transaction entered into after july  trs income 
a trs may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent reit 
both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs 
a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs 
overall  no more than prior to of the value of a reit s assets may consist of securities of one or more trss 
however  a trs does not include a corporation which directly or indirectly i operates or manages a health care or lodging facility  or ii provides to any other person under a franchise  license  or otherwise rights to any brand name under which a health care or lodging facility is operated 
beginning in  however  a trs will be able to own or lease a health care facility provided that the facility is operated and managed by an eligible independent contractor 
a trs will pay income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns 
in addition  the new rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation 
the rules also impose a excise tax on transactions between a trs and its parent reit or the reit s operators that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
a stated above  we do not lease any of our facilities to any of our trss 

table of contents failure to satisfy income tests 
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the or gross income tests for any taxable year  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code 
these relief provisions will be generally available if our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our tax return  and any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax 
it is not possible  however  to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 
even if these relief provisions apply  we would incur a tax on the gross income attributable to the greater of the amounts by which we fail the and gross income tests  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability and we would file a schedule with descriptions of each item of gross income that caused the failure 
resolution of related party tenant issue 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that  due to certain provisions of the series b preferred stock issued to us by advocat  inc advocat in in connection with a restructuring  advocat may have been considered to be a related party tenant under the rules applicable to reits 
as a result  we took steps in to restructure our relationship with advocat and ownership of advocat securities in order to avoid having the rent received from advocat classified as received from a related party tenant in taxable years after  and submitted a request to the irs on december   that in the event that rental income received by us from advocat would not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests  such failure during taxable years prior to was due to reasonable cause 
during  we entered into a closing agreement with the irs covering all affected taxable periods prior to  which stated that our failure to meet the gross income tests as a result of the advocat rental income being considered to be received from a related party tenant was due to reasonable cause 
in connection with reaching this agreement with the irs  we paid to the irs penalty income taxes and interest totaling approximately million for the tax years through we had previously accrued million of income tax liabilities as of december  based on our execution of the closing agreement with the irs and the restructuring of our relationship with advocat  we believe that we have fully resolved all tax issues relating to rental income received from advocat prior to and have been advised by tax counsel that we will not receive any non qualifying related party tenant income from advocat in and future fiscal years 
accordingly  we do not expect to incur tax expense associated with related party tenant income in the periods commencing january  asset tests 
at the close of each quarter of our taxable year  we must also satisfy the following tests relating to the nature of our assets 
first  at least of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including i our allocable share of real estate assets held by partnerships in which we own an interest and ii stock or debt instruments held for less than one year purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term at least five years debt offering of our company  cash  cash items and government securities 
second  of our investments not included in the asset class  the value of our interest in any one issuer s securities may not exceed of the value of our total assets 
third  we may not own more than of the voting power or value of any one issuer s outstanding securities 
fourth  no more than prior to of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more trss 
fifth  no more than of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of trss and other non trs taxable subsidiaries and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the asset test 
for purposes of the second and third asset tests described below the term securities does not include our equity or debt securities of a qualified reit subsidiary  a trs  or an equity interest in any partnership  since we are deemed to own our proportionate share of each asset of any partnership of which we are a partner 
furthermore  for purposes of determining whether we own more than of the value of only one issuer s outstanding securities  the term securities does not include i any loan to an individual or an estate  ii any code section rental agreement  iii any obligation to pay rents from real property  iv certain government issued securities  v any security issued by another reit  and vi our debt securities in any partnership  not otherwise excepted under i through v above  a to the extent of our interest as a partner in the partnership or b if of the partnership s gross income is derived from sources described in the income test set forth above 
we may own up to of the stock of one or more trss 
however  overall  no more than prior to of the value of our assets may consist of securities of one or more trss  and no more than of the value of our assets may consist of the securities of trss and other non trs taxable subsidiaries including stock in non reit c corporations and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the asset test 
if the outstanding principal balance of a mortgage loan exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan  a portion of such loan likely will not be a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the test 
the nonqualifying portion of that mortgage loan will be equal to the portion of the loan amount that exceeds the value of the associated real property 

table of contents after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter  we will not lose our status as a reit for failure to satisfy any of the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values 
if the failure to satisfy the asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter  the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within days after the close of that quarter 
for our tax years beginning after  subject to certain de minimis exceptions  we may avoid reit disqualification in the event of certain failures under the asset tests  provided that i we file a schedule with a description of each asset that caused the failure  ii the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect  iii we dispose of the assets within months after the last day of the quarter in which the identification of the failure occurred or the requirements of the rules are otherwise met within such period  and iv we pay a tax on the failure equal to the greater of a  per failure  and b the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure for the period beginning on the date of the failure and ending on the date we dispose of the asset or otherwise satisfy the requirements multiplied by the highest applicable corporate tax rate 
annual distribution requirements 
to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
in addition  such distributions are required to be made pro rata  with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class  and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain  or distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
furthermore  if we fail to distribute during a calendar year  or by the end of january following the calendar year in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year  at least the sum of of our reit ordinary income for such year  of our reit capital gain income for such year  and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods  we will incur a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts we actually distribute 
we may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long term capital gain we receive in a taxable year 
if we so elect  we will be treated as having distributed any such retained amount for purposes of the excise tax described above 
we have made  and we intend to continue to make  timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements 
we may also be entitled to pay and deduct deficiency dividends in later years as a relief measure to correct errors in determining our taxable income 
although we may be able to avoid income tax on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends  we will be required to pay interest to the irs based upon the amount of any deduction we take for deficiency dividends 
the availability to us of  among other things  depreciation deductions with respect to our owned facilities depends upon the treatment by us as the owner of such facilities for federal income tax purposes  and the classification of the leases with respect to such facilities as true leases rather than financing arrangements for federal income tax purposes 
the questions of whether we are the owner of such facilities and ii the leases are true leases for federal tax purposes  are essentially factual matters 
we believe that we will be treated as the owner of each of the facilities that we lease  and such leases will be treated as true leases for federal income tax purposes 
however  no assurances can be given that the irs will not successfully challenge our status as the owner of our facilities subject to leases  and the status of such leases as true leases  asserting that the purchase of the facilities by us and the leasing of such facilities merely constitute steps in secured financing transactions in which the lessees are owners of the facilities and we are merely a secured creditor 
in such event  we would not be entitled to claim depreciation deductions with respect to any of the affected facilities 
as a result  we might fail to meet the distribution requirement or  if such requirement is met  we might be subject to corporate income tax or the excise tax 
reasonable cause savings clause 
we may avoid disqualification in the event of a failure to meet certain requirements for reit qualification if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect  and if the reit pays a penalty of  for each such failure 
this reasonable cause safe harbor is not available for failures to meet the and gross income tests  the rules with respect to ownership of securities of more than of a single issuer  and the new rules provided for failures of the asset tests 
failure to qualify 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  and the reasonable cause relief provisions do not apply  we will be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible and our failure to qualify as a reit would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income  to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits  and  subject to certain limitations of the code  corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we would also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to such statutory relief 
failure to qualify could result in our incurring indebtedness or liquidating investments to pay the resulting taxes 

table of contents other tax matters 
we own and operate a number of properties through qualified reit subsidiaries  qrss 
the qrss are treated as qualified reit subsidiaries under the code 
code section i provides that a corporation which is a qualified reit subsidiary shall not be treated as a separate corporation  and all assets  liabilities  and items of income  deduction  and credit of a qualified reit subsidiary shall be treated as assets  liabilities and such items as the case may be of the reit 
thus  in applying the tests for reit qualification described above  the qrss will be ignored  and all assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction  and credit of such qrss will be treated as our assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction  and credit 
in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership  the reit is treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and as earning its allocable share of the gross income of the partnership for purposes of the applicable reit qualification tests 
thus  our proportionate share of the assets  liabilities  and items of income of any partnership  joint venture  or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which we own an interest  directly 
government regulation and reimbursement all of our properties are used as healthcare facilities  and as a result  we are directly affected by the risk associated with government regulation and reimbursement 
our operators  as well as any facilities that may be owned and operated for our own account from time to time  derive a substantial portion of their net operating revenues from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  our operators are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation including  but not limited to  laws and regulations relating to licensure  operations  facilities  professional staff and insurance 
these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial change  which may be applied retroactively 
changes in government laws and regulations  interpretations  increased regulatory enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by an operator can significantly affect the operator s ability to operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such operator s ability to meet its contractual and financial obligations to us 
reimbursement 
the recent downturn in the us economy and other factors could result in significant cost cutting at both the federal and state levels  resulting in a reduction of reimbursement rates and levels to our operators under both the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  congress currently is considering options for healthcare reform legislation  and some of the options under consideration would impact snfs and could result in decreases in payments to snfs or otherwise diminish the financial condition of individual snfs 
although the house of representatives and the senate each passed health reform bills in late  the two bills are different 
we cannot predict whether healthcare reform legislation will be enacted into law  and if healthcare reform legislation is enacted  we cannot predict the ultimate content or timing of this legislation 
we also cannot predict the effect that any such legislation may have on our operators 
we currently believe that our operator coverage ratios are adequate and that our operators can absorb moderate reimbursement rate reductions under medicaid and medicare and still meet their obligations to us 
however  significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an operator s results of operations and financial condition  which could adversely affect the operator s ability to meet its obligations to us 
medicaid 
each state has its own medicaid program that is funded jointly by the state and the us federal government 
federal law governs how each state manages its medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit the needs and resources of their citizens 
currently  medicaid is the single largest source of financing for long term care in the united states 
current market and economic conditions will likely have a significant impact on state budgets and healthcare spending 
fiscal conditions have continued to deteriorate  and many states are experiencing significant budget gaps 
the budget deficits are exacerbated by increased enrollment in medicaid during and anticipated increased enrollment in fiscal year since the profit margins on medicaid patients are generally relatively low  substantial reductions in medicaid reimbursement could adversely affect our operators results of operations and financial condition  which in turn could negatively impact us 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  which was signed into law on february   provides for enhanced federal medicaid matching rates that may provide some relief to states 
because states have discretion with respect to their medicaid programs  some states may address budget shortfalls outside of medicaid by reallocating state funds that otherwise would have been spent on medicaid expenditures 
as a result  the impact of the arra medicaid funding on our operators will depend on how states choose to use the funding 

table of contents in and early  the center for medicare medicaid services cms issued a number of medicaid rules that have the potential to reduce the funding available under state medicaid programs to reimburse long term care providers 
several of these rules were rescinded on june   including rules related to specialized transportation to schools for children covered by medicaid  outpatient hospital services and certain provisions related to targeted case management services 
in addition  cms delayed until june  the enforcement of certain provisions of a regulation related to healthcare related taxes 
however  other regulatory provisions have been implemented  including a reduction in the maximum allowable healthcare related taxes that states can impose on providers reduced from percent to percent 
this rule could result in lower taxes for providers  but also could result in less overall funding for state medicaid programs by limiting the ability of states to fund the non federal share of the medicaid program 
as a result  the operators of our properties could potentially experience reductions in medicaid funding  which could adversely impact their ability to meet their obligations to us 
medicare 
medicare is a social insurance program administered by the us federal government  providing health insurance to people who are aged and over  or who meet special criteria 
similar to the medicaid program  the medicare program may be subject to future reform and cost cutting measures in response to the recent downturn in us economic and market conditions 
on july   cms announced a final rule on medicare s prospective payment system for snfs for fiscal year the final rule includes a reduction in payments to nursing homes equal to billion  or percent  resulting from a recalibration of the case mix indices 
however  cms estimates that the fiscal year market basket adjustment of percent  or million  will partially offset the billion adjustment  resulting in an aggregate decrease in medicare payments to snfs during fiscal year of approximately million  or percent 
the changes may have different impacts on individual snfs  depending in part on the characteristics of the patient populations of individual facilities 
our operators may receive reduced medicare payments as a result of the final rule  which could have an adverse effect on their ability to satisfy their financial obligations 
the fiscal year began on october  and ends on september  in addition to the recalibration of the case mix indices and payment update  cms finalized a revised case mix classification system  the rug iv  and implementation schedule for fiscal year the change in case mix classification methodology has the potential to impact reimbursement  although the ultimate impact of the rug iv classification model on reimbursement to the individual operators of our facilities is unknown 
the fiscal year ended on september  on august   cms published a final rule on medicare s prospective payment system for snfs for fiscal year at the time  cms estimated that these payment policies would increase aggregate medicare payments to snfs during fiscal year by million compared to fiscal year 
medicare law currently includes therapy caps  which limit the physical therapy  speech language therapy and occupational therapy services that a medicare beneficiary can receive during a calendar year 
these caps do not apply to therapy services covered under medicare part a in snfs  although the caps apply in most other instances involving patients in snfs or long term care facilities who receive therapy services covered under medicare part b 
congress implemented a temporary therapy cap exceptions process  which permitted medically necessary therapy services to exceed the payment limits 
however  the therapy caps exceptions process expired on december  if the therapy caps exceptions process is not reinstated  this could have material adverse effects on our operators financial condition and operations  which could adversely impact their ability to meet their obligations to us 
quality of care initiatives 
cms has implemented a number of initiatives focused on the quality of care provided by nursing homes that could affect our operators 
for instance  in february  cms made publicly available on its website the names of all nursing homes targeted in its special focus facility program for underperforming nursing homes 
cms plans to update the list regularly 
as another example  in december  cms released quality ratings for all of the nursing homes that participate in medicare or medicaid 
facility rankings  ranging from five stars much above average to one star much below average will be updated on a monthly basis 
in the event any of our operators do not maintain the same or superior levels of quality care as their competitors  patients could choose alternate facilities  which could adversely impact our operators revenues 
in addition  the reporting of such information could lead to future reimbursement policies that reward or penalize facilities on the basis of the reported quality of care parameters 
the office of inspector general oig of the department of health and human services also has carried out a number of projects focused on the quality of care provided by nursing homes 
for example  in september  the oig released a report based on an analysis of data from cms online survey and certification reporting system oscar  which contains the results of all state nursing home surveys 
the report notes that over percent of nursing homes surveyed were cited for deficiencies and complaints between and the most common deficiencies cited involved quality of care  resident assessments and quality of life 
a greater percentage of for profit nursing homes were cited than not for profit and government nursing homes 
in addition  the oig s work plan for fiscal year  which describes projects that the oig plans to address during the fiscal year  includes a number of projects related to nursing homes 

table of contents fraud and abuse laws and regulations 
there are various extremely complex civil and criminal federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals  relationships and arrangements prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers 
many of these laws raise issues that have not been clearly interpreted 
governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
the federal anti kickback statute is a criminal statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any remuneration in return for  to induce  or to arrange for the referral of individuals for any item or service payable by a federal or state healthcare program 
there is also a civil analogue 
states also have enacted similar statutes covering medicaid payments and some states have broader statutes 
some enforcement efforts have targeted relationships between snfs and ancillary providers  relationships between snfs and referral sources for snfs and relationships between snfs and facilities for which the snfs serve as referral sources 
the federal self referral law  commonly known as the stark law  is a civil statute that prohibits certain referrals by physicians to entities providing designated health services if these physicians have financial relationships with the entities 
some of the services provided in snfs are classified as designated health services 
there are also criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under medicare and medicaid  as well as failing to refund overpayments or improper payments 
violation of the anti kickback statute or stark law may form the basis for a false claims act violation 
in addition  the federal false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these incentives  these so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
the violation of any fraud and abuse law or regulation by an operator could result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize that operator s ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating its facility 
privacy laws 
our operators are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations designed to protect confidentiality and security of patient health information  including the privacy and security provisions in the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of and the corresponding regulations promulgated  known as hipaa 
hipaa was amended by the american recovery and reinvestment act of  known as the stimulus bill to increase penalties for hipaa violations  imposing stricter requirements on healthcare providers  in most cases requiring notifications if there is a breach of an individual s protected health information including public announcements if the breach affects a significant number of individuals  and expanding possibilities for enforcement 
our operators may have to expend significant funds to secure the health information they hold  including upgrading their computer systems 
if our operators are found in violation of hipaa such operators may be required to pay large penalties 
compliance with public notification requirements in the event of a breach could cause reputational harm to their business 
obligations to pay large penalties or tarnishing of reputation could adversely affect the ability of our operators to pay their obligations to us 
licensing  certification and other laws and regulations 
our operators and facilities are subject to the regulatory and licensing requirements of federal  state and local authorities and are periodically audited to confirm compliance 
failure to obtain licensure or loss or suspension of licensure would prevent a facility from operating or result in a suspension of reimbursement payments until all licensure issues are resolved and the necessary licenses obtained or reinstated 
for example  some of our facilities may be unable to satisfy current and future state certificate of need requirements and may for this reason be unable to continue operating in the future 
in such event  our revenues from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time or permanently 
additional federal  state and local laws affect how our operators conduct their operations  including federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of patient health information  laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices  and laws generally affecting our operators management of property and equipment and how our operators conduct their operations including laws and regulations involving fire  health and safety  quality of services  care and food service  residents rights  including abuse and neglect laws  and the health standards set by the federal occupational safety and health administration 
we are unable to predict the effect that potential changes in these requirements could have on the revenues of our operators  and thus their ability to meet their obligations to us 
legislative and regulatory developments 
each year  legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would result in major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
we are unable to predict accurately whether any proposals will be adopted  or if adopted  what effect  if any  these proposals would have on our operators or our business

item a risk factors following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s financial condition  results of operations  business and prospects to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report or the company s other filings with the sec 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other risks described in this report including but not limited to those described under taxation and government regulation reimbursement under item above 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing the company and there may be additional risks of which the company is not presently aware or that the company currently considers unlikely to significantly impact the company 
our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks  and  as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we have grouped the following risk factors into three general categories risks related to the operators of our facilities  risks related to us and our operations  and risks related to our stock 
risks related to the operators of our facilities our financial position could be weakened and our ability to make distributions and fulfill our obligations with respect to our indebtedness could be limited if any of our major operators become unable to meet their obligations to us or fail to renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire or their mortgages mature  or if we become unable to lease or re lease our facilities or make mortgage loans on economically favorable terms 
we have no operational control over our operators 
adverse developments concerning our operators could arise due to a number of factors  including those listed below 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of our operators could limit or delay our ability to recover on our investments 
we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their lease  mortgage and other obligations to us or other third parties  which could result in their bankruptcy or insolvency 
further  the current economic climate that exists in the united states serves to heighten and increase this risk 
although our lease agreements and loan agreements typically provide us with the right to terminate the agreement  evict an operator  foreclose on our collateral  demand immediate payment and exercise other remedies  title of the united states code  as amended and supplemented the bankruptcy code  would limit or  at a minimum  delay our ability to collect unpaid pre bankruptcy rents and mortgage payments and to pursue other remedies against a bankrupt operator 

table of contents leases 
a bankruptcy filing by one of our lessee operators would typically prevent us from collecting unpaid pre bankruptcy rents or evicting the operator  absent approval of the bankruptcy court 
the bankruptcy code provides a lessee with the option to assume or reject an unexpired lease within certain specified periods of time 
generally  a lessee is required to pay all rent arising between its bankruptcy filing and the assumption or rejection of the lease although such payments will likely be delayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing 
if one of our lessee operators chooses to assume its lease with us  the operator must cure all monetary defaults existing under the lease including payment of unpaid pre bankruptcy rents and provide adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations under the lease 
if one of our lessee operators opts to reject its lease with us  we would have a claim against such operator for unpaid and future rents payable under the lease  but such claim would be subject to a statutory cap and would generally result in a recovery substantially less than the face value of such claim 
although the operator s rejection of the lease would permit us to recover possession of the leased facility  we would still face losses  costs and delays associated with re leasing the facility to a new operator 
several other factors could impact our rights under leases with bankrupt operators 
first  the operator could seek to assign its lease with us to a third party 
the bankruptcy code generally disregards anti assignment provisions in leases to permit assignment of unexpired leases to third parties provided all monetary defaults under the lease are cured and the third party can demonstrate its ability to perform its obligations under the lease 
second  in instances in which we have entered into a master lease agreement with an operator that operates more than one facility  there exists the risk that the bankruptcy court could determine that the master lease was comprised of separate  divisible leases each of which could be separately assumed or rejected  rather than a single  integrated lease which would have to be assumed or rejected in its entirety 
finally  there exists the risk that the bankruptcy court could re characterize our lease agreement as a disguised financing arrangement  which could require us to receive bankruptcy court approval to foreclose or pursue other remedies with respect to the facility 
mortgages 
a bankruptcy filing by an operator to whom we have made a mortgage loan would typically prevent us from collecting unpaid pre bankruptcy mortgage payments and foreclosing on our collateral  absent approval of the bankruptcy court 
as an initial matter  we could ask the bankruptcy court to order the operator to make periodic payments or provide other financial assurances to us during the bankruptcy case known as adequate protection  but the ultimate decision regarding adequate protection including the timing and amount rests with the bankruptcy court 
in addition  we would have to receive bankruptcy court approval before we could commence or continue any foreclosure action against the operator s facility 
the bankruptcy court could withhold such approval  especially if the operator can demonstrate that the facility is necessary for an effective reorganization and that we have a sufficient equity cushion in the facility 
if the bankruptcy court does not either grant us adequate protection or permit us to foreclose on our collateral  we may not receive any loan payments until after the bankruptcy court confirms a plan of reorganization for the operator 
even if the bankruptcy court permits us to foreclose on the facility  we would still be subject to the losses  costs and other risks associated with a foreclosure sale  including possible successor liability under government programs  indemnification obligations and suspension or delay of third party payments 
should such events occur  our income and cash flow from operations would be adversely affected 
failure by our operators to comply with various local  state and federal government regulations may adversely impact their ability to make debt or lease payments to us 
our operators are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted 
these changes may have a dramatic effect on our operators costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third party payors 
the failure of any of our operators to comply with these laws  requirements and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in particular medicare and medicaid 
a significant portion of our snf and nursing home operators revenue is derived from governmentally funded reimbursement programs  primarily medicare and medicaid 
failure to maintain certification and accreditation in these programs would result in a loss of funding from such programs 
see the risk factor entitled our operators depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third party payors and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced for further discussion 

table of contents licensing and certification 
our operators and facilities are subject to regulatory and licensing requirements of federal  state and local authorities and are periodically audited by these authorities 
failure to obtain licensure or loss or suspension of licensure would prevent a facility from operating or result in a suspension of reimbursement payments until all licensure issues have been resolved and the necessary licenses obtained or reinstated 
in such event  our revenues from these facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time or permanently 
in addition  licensing and medicare and medicaid laws also require operators of nursing homes and assisted living facilities to comply with extensive standards governing operations 
federal and state agencies administering those laws regularly inspect such facilities and investigate complaints 
our operators and their managers receive notices of potential sanctions and remedies from time to time  and such sanctions have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them 
if our operators are unable to cure deficiencies  which have been identified or which are identified in the future  such sanctions may be imposed 
if imposed  the resulting sanctions may adversely affect our operators revenues  potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us 
fraud and abuse laws and regulations 
there are various extremely complex civil and criminal federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals  relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers 
many of these laws raise issues that have not been clearly interpreted

some of the services provided in snfs are classified as designated health services 
there are also criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under medicare and medicaid  as well as failing to refund overpayments or improper payments 
violation of the anti kickback statute or stark law may form the basis for a false claims act violation 
in addition  the federal false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these incentives  these so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
the violation of any of these laws or regulations by an operator may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties  including exclusion from medicare  medicaid  and all other federal and state healthcare programs 
such fines or penalties could jeopardize that operator s ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating its facility 
privacy laws 
our operators are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations designed to protect confidentiality and security of patient health information  including the privacy and security provisions in the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of and the corresponding regulations promulgated  known as hipaa 
hipaa was amended by the american recovery and reinvestment act of  known as the stimulus bill  to increase penalties for hipaa violations 
these changes include the imposition of stricter requirements on healthcare providers  requiring notifications in most cases if there is a breach of an individual s protected health information including public announcements if the breach affects a significant number of individuals and the expansion of possibilities for enforcement 
our operators may have to expend significant funds to secure the health information they hold  including upgrading their computer systems 
if our operators are found in violation of hipaa  such operators may be required to pay large penalties 
compliance with public notification requirements in the event of a breach could cause reputational harm to their business 
obligations to pay large penalties or tarnishing of reputation could adversely affect the ability of our operators to pay their obligations to us 
other laws 
other federal  state and local laws and regulations that impact how our operators conduct their operations include i laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices  ii laws generally affecting our operators management of property and equipment and how our operators generally conduct their operations  such as fire  health and safety laws  iii laws affecting assisted living facilities mandating quality of services and care  including food services  and iv resident rights including abuse and neglect laws and health standards set by the federal occupational safety and health administration 
we cannot predict the effect that the additional costs of complying with these laws may have on the revenues of our operators  and thus their ability to meet their obligations to us 

table of contents legislative and regulatory developments 
each year  legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal and state levels that would result in major changes in the healthcare system 
we cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted  and if adopted  what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators  and as a result  our business 
healthcare reform 
the us congress is currently debating legislation that  if enacted into law  would make significant changes to the healthcare system 
although the house of representatives and the senate each passed healthcare reform bills in late  the two bills are different 
we cannot predict whether healthcare reform legislation will be enacted into law  and if healthcare reform legislation is enacted  we cannot predict the ultimate content or timing of this legislation 
we also cannot predict the effect that any such legislation may have on our operators 
our operators depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third party payors and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced 
changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements for services provided by our operators has in the past  and could in the future  result in a substantial reduction in our operators revenues and operating margins 
additionally  net revenue realizable under third party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post payment audits 
payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable or because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary 
there also continue to be new legislative and regulatory proposals that could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers 
in some cases  states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for the services provided by our operators  which are currently being reimbursed by medicare  medicaid or private third party payors 
in its january meeting  the medicare payment advisory commission medpac  a commission chartered by congress to advise congress on medicare payment policies  recommended elimination of the market basket update for snfs 
we cannot estimate at this time whether the centers for medicare and medicaid services will adopt the medpac recommendations 
we currently believe that our operator coverage ratios are strong and that our operators can absorb moderate reimbursement rate reductions and still meet their financial obligations to us 
however  significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity  financial condition and results of operations  which could cause the revenues of our operators to decline and jeopardize their ability to meet their obligations to us 
government budget deficits could lead to a reduction in medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
the downturn in the us economy has negatively affected state budgets  which may put pressure on states to decrease reimbursement rates for our operators with the goal of decreasing state expenditures under their state medicaid programs 
the need to control medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in medicaid due to unemployment and declines in family incomes 
these potential reductions could be compounded by the potential for federal cost cutting efforts that could lead to reductions in reimbursement to our operators under both the medicare and medicaid programs 
potential reductions in medicare and medicaid reimbursement to our operators could reduce the cash flow of our operators and their ability to make rent or mortgage payments to us 
since the profit margins on medicaid patients are generally relatively low  more than modest reductions in medicaid reimbursement could place some operators in financial distress  which in turn could adversely affect us 
we may be unable to find a replacement operator for one or more of our leased properties 
from time to time  we may need to find a replacement operator for one or more of our leased properties for a variety of reasons  including upon the expiration of the term of the applicable lease or upon a default by the applicable operator 
during any period that we are attempting to locate one or more replacement operators  there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on the applicable property or properties 
we cannot assure you that any of our current or future operators will elect to renew their respective leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate a suitable replacement operator or  if we are successful in locating a replacement operator  that the rental payments from the new operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments 
our ability to locate a suitable replacement operator may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing  receivership  certificate of need or other laws  as well as by medicare and medicaid change of ownership rules 
we also may incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing  receivership or change of ownership proceedings 
any such delays  limitations and expenses could materially delay or impact our ability to collect rent  to obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise to exercise remedies for default and could have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents a prolonged economic slowdown could adversely impact our operating income and earnings  as well as the results of operations of our operators  which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us 
the current economic slowdown has resulted in continued concerns regarding the adverse impact caused by inflation  deflation  increased unemployment  volatile energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  a distressed real estate market  market volatility and weakened business and consumer confidence 
this difficult operating environment could have an adverse impact on the ability of our operators to maintain occupancy rates  which could harm their financial condition 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses by our operators under our leases and loans could adversely affect our income from investments in our portfolio 
certain third parties may not be able to satisfy their obligations to us or our operators due to continued uncertainty in the capital markets 
as a result of current economic conditions  including uncertainty in the capital markets  credit markets have tightened significantly such that the ability to obtain new capital has become more challenging and more expensive 
in addition  several large financial institutions have either recently failed or become dependent on the assistance of the us federal government to continue to operate as a going concern 
interest rate fluctuations  financial market volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability of our operators to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms  which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us 
similarly  if any of our other counterparties  such as letter of credit issuers  insurance carriers  banking institutions  title companies and escrow agents  experience difficulty in accessing capital or other sources of funds or fails to remain a viable entity  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
our operators may be subject to significant legal actions that could result in their increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities  which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
as is typical in the long term healthcare industry  our operators are often subject to claims for damages relating to the services that they provide 
we can give no assurance that the insurance coverage maintained by our operators will cover all claims made against them or continue to be available at a reasonable cost  if at all 
in some states  insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and or litigation may not  in certain cases  be available to operators due to state law prohibitions or limitations of availability 
as a result  our operators operating in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered or are in excess of their insurance policy limits 
tc healthcare  the entity operating facilities on our behalf on an interim basis  may be named as a defendant in professional liability claims related to the properties that were transitioned from haven eldercare  llc haven facilities as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations portfolio and other developments 
in these suits  patients could allege significant damages  including punitive damages 
we currently consolidate the financial results of tc healthcare in our financial statements  and as such  our financial results could suffer 
effective as of july   we took ownership and or possession of the former haven facilities and tc healthcare  an entity in which we have a substantial economic interest  subsequently began operating these facilities on our behalf through an independent contractor 
we also believe that there has been  and will continue to be  an increase in governmental investigations of long term care providers  particularly in the area of medicare medicaid false claims  as well as an increase in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations 
insurance is not available to our operators to cover such losses 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or governmental investigation  whether currently asserted or arising in the future  could have a material adverse effect on an operator s financial condition 
if an operator is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage  if judgments are obtained in excess of the insurance coverage  if an operator is required to pay uninsured punitive damages  or if an operator is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action  the operator could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities 
such liabilities could adversely affect the operator s ability to meet its obligations to us 
in addition  we may in some circumstances be named as a defendant in litigation involving the services provided by our operators 
although we generally have no involvement in the services provided by our operators  and our standard lease agreements and loan agreements generally require our operators to indemnify us and carry insurance to cover us in certain cases  a significant judgment against us in such litigation could exceed our and our operators insurance coverage  which would require us to make payments to cover the judgment 

table of contents increased competition as well as increased operating costs have resulted in lower revenues for some of our operators and may affect the ability of our operators to meet their payment obligations to us 
the long term healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future 
our operators are competing with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies  life care at home  community based service programs  retirement communities and convalescent centers 
our operators compete on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided  reputation  the physical appearance of a facility  price  the range of services offered  family preference  alternatives for healthcare delivery  the supply of competing properties  physicians  staff  referral sources  location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding areas 
we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us 
our operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses and therefore affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 
the market for qualified nurses  healthcare professionals and other key personnel is highly competitive and our operators may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
increases in labor costs due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel incurred by our operators could affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 
this situation could be particularly acute in certain states that have enacted legislation establishing minimum staffing requirements 
we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans  and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts  we may be unable to successfully find a replacement operator  or operate or occupy the underlying real estate  which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 
if an operator defaults under one of our mortgage loans  we may foreclose on the loan or otherwise protect our interest by acquiring title to the property 
in such a scenario  we may be required to make substantial improvements or repairs to maximize the facility s investment potential 
operators may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies  seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations 
even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans  we may be unable to expeditiously find a replacement operator  if at all  or otherwise successfully operate or occupy the property  which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investment 
certain of our operators account for a significant percentage of our real estate investment and revenues 
at december   approximately of our real estate investments were operated by two public companies sun healthcare group sun and advocat inc advocat 
our largest private company operators by investment were communicare healthcare services communicare  signature holding ii  llc  guardian ltc management inc and formation capital corporation 
no other operator represents more than of our investments 
for the year ended december   our revenues from operations totaled million  of which approximately million were from communicare  million from sun and million from advocat 
no other operator generated more than of our revenues from operations for the year ended december  in addition  our owned and operated assets generated million of revenue in on a pro forma basis as if the december acquisition of certain subsidiaries owned by capitalsource inc had been completed as of january   our pro forma revenues for the year ended december  were million  of which approximately million would have been from sun  million from communicare and million from advocat 
no other operator generated more than of pro forma revenues from operations for the year ended december  we cannot assure you that any of our operators will have sufficient assets  income or access to financing to enable it them to satisfy their obligations to us 
any failure by our operators  and specifically those operators described above  to effectively conduct their operations could materially reduce our revenues and net income  which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay and cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents risks related to us and our operations we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs  and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital  we may not be able to make future investments necessary to grow our business or meet maturing commitments 
to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the code  we are required  among other things  to distribute at least of our reit taxable income each year to our stockholders 
because of this distribution requirement  we may not be able to fund  from cash retained from operations  all future capital needs  including capital needed to make investments and to satisfy or refinance maturing commitments 
as a result  we rely on external sources of capital  including debt and equity financing 
if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources  we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business  or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature  which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even  in extreme circumstances  affect our ability to continue operations 
our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including the performance of the national and global economies generally  competition in the healthcare industry  issues facing the healthcare industry  including regulations and government reimbursement policies  our operators operating costs  the ratings of our debt and preferred securities  the market s perception of our growth potential  the market value of our properties  our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions  and the market price of the shares of our capital stock 
difficult capital market conditions in our industry during the past several years  exacerbated by the recent economic downturn  and our need to stabilize our portfolio have limited and may continue to limit our access to capital 
while we currently have sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our obligations and commitments  we may not be in position to take advantage of future investment opportunities in the event that we are unable to access the capital markets on a timely basis or we are only able to obtain financing on unfavorable terms 
current economic conditions and turbulence in the credit markets may create challenges in securing third party borrowings or refinancing our existing debt  and may cause market rental rates and property values to decline 
current economic conditions  the availability and cost of credit  turmoil in the mortgage market and declining real estate markets have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for real estate markets and the economy as a whole going forward 
many economists are predicting continued deterioration in economic conditions in the united states  along with significant increases in unemployment and vacancy rates at commercial properties 
in the event that the constriction within the credit markets persists  we may face challenges in securing third party borrowings or refinancing our existing debt in the future 
additionally  should such economic conditions continue for a prolonged period of time  the value of our commercial real estate assets and our ability to achieve market rental rates would decline significantly 
in the near term  we believe that we are well positioned to withstand this downturn  however  no assurances can be given that current economic conditions and the effects of the credit crisis will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to raise capital through equity sales is dependent  in part  on the market price of our common stock  and our failure to meet market expectations with respect to our business could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and availability of equity capital 
as with other publicly traded companies  the availability of equity capital will depend  in part  on the market price of our common stock which  in turn  will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time including the extent of investor interest  the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  our financial performance and that of our operators  the contents of analyst reports about us and the reit industry  general stock and bond market conditions  including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities  which may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions  our failure to maintain or increase our dividend  which is dependent  to a large part  on growth of funds from operations which in turn depends upon increased revenues from additional investments and rental increases  and other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in reit tax laws 
the market value of the equity securities of a reit is generally based upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 
our failure to meet the market s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and  as a result  the availability of equity capital to us 

table of contents we are subject to risks associated with debt financing  which could negatively impact our business and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to repay maturing debt 
the financing required to make future investments and satisfy maturing commitments may be provided by borrowings under our credit facilities  private or public offerings of debt  the assumption of secured indebtedness  mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
to the extent we must obtain debt financing from external sources to fund our capital requirements  we cannot guarantee such financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions  our cash flow may not be sufficient to make distributions to our stockholders and repay our maturing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates  changes in our debt ratings or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase  which could reduce our profitability and the amount of dividends we are able to pay 
moreover  additional debt financing increases the amount of our leverage 
the degree of leverage could have important consequences to stockholders  including affecting our investment grade ratings and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  and making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our results of operations or the economy generally 
unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability 
our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions that may not prove to be successful 
for example  we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to our acquired properties  including contingent liabilities  or our newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business 
as a further example  if we agree to provide funding to enable healthcare operators to build  expand or renovate facilities on our properties and the project is not completed  we could be forced to become involved in the development to ensure completion or we could lose the property 
such costs may negatively affect our results of operations 
we can provide you with no assurance that the contemplated capitalsource acquisitions will occur 
the acquisition of certain subsidiaries owned by capitalsource inc that we expect to occur in the second quarter of is subject to a number of closing conditions  including but not limited to approval of the us department of housing and urban development 
in addition  we are not obligated to exercise the option we currently hold to acquire certain other capitalsource subsidiaries owning additional facilities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance as to whether or when either of these closings will occur 
we may not be able to adapt our management and operational systems to integrate and manage our growth without additional expense our december acquisition of certain capitalsource subsidiaries has significantly increased the number of long term care facilities in our investment portfolio and the number of states in which we own facilities 
we will likely acquire additional capitalsource subsidiaries  which will further expand the size and scope of our portfolio 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our management  administrative  accounting and operational systems to integrate and manage the facilities we have acquired and those that we may acquire under our existing cost structure in a timely manner 
our failure to timely integrate and manage the acquisition of the capitalsource subsidiaries and future acquisitions or developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be subject to additional risks in connection with our past and future acquisitions of long term care facilities 
we may be subject to additional risks in connection with past and future acquisitions of long term care facilities  including but not limited to the facilities we recently acquired from capitalsource inc  such as the following we have no previous business experience with the operators of a number of the facilities we have acquired or may acquire in the future  the facilities may underperform due to various factors  including unfavorable terms and conditions of the lease agreements that we assume or may assume  disruptions caused by the management of the operators of the facilities or changes in economic conditions impacting the facilities and or the operators  diversion of our management s attention away from other business concerns  exposure to any undisclosed or unknown potential liabilities relating to the facilities  and potential underinsured losses on the facilities 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the facilities we have acquired or may acquire in the future without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us 
our assets may be subject to impairment charges 
we periodically  but not less than annually  evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we are required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
we may not be able to sell certain closed facilities for their book value 
from time to time  we close facilities and actively market such facilities for sale 
to the extent we are unable to sell these properties for our book value  we may be required to take a non cash impairment charge or loss on the sale  either of which would reduce our net income 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have substantial indebtedness and we may increase our indebtedness in the future 
our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders 
for example  it could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to holders of our capital stock  increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business plan or other general corporate purposes on satisfactory terms or at all 
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and leases  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  or to carry out other aspects of our business plan  require us to pledge as collateral substantially all of our assets  require us to maintain certain debt coverage and financial ratios at specified levels  thereby reducing our financial flexibility  limit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise  expose us to fluctuations in interest rates  to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interests  result in a possible downgrade of our credit rating  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
covenants in our debt documents limit our operational flexibility  and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations 
the terms of our loan agreements and note indentures require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants which may limit our management s discretion by restricting our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  redeem our capital stock  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments and create liens 
any additional financing we may obtain could contain similar or more restrictive covenants 
our continued ability to incur indebtedness and conduct our operations is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants 
breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness  in addition to any other indebtedness cross defaulted against such instruments 
any such breach could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have now  and may have in the future  exposure to contingent rent escalators 
we receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under leases that are long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations  subject to certain limitations 
certain leases contain escalators contingent on changes in the consumer price index 
if the consumer price index does not increase  our revenues may not increase 

table of contents we are subject to particular risks associated with real estate ownership  which could result in unanticipated losses or expenses 
our business is subject to many risks that are associated with the ownership of real estate 
for example  if our operators do not renew their leases  we may be unable to re lease the facilities at favorable rental rates 
other risks that are associated with real estate acquisition and ownership include  without limitation  the following general liability  property and casualty losses  some of which may be uninsured  the inability to purchase or sell our assets rapidly to respond to changing economic conditions  due to the illiquid nature of real estate and the real estate market  leases which are not renewed or are renewed at lower rental amounts at expiration  the exercise of purchase options by operators resulting in a reduction of our rental revenue  costs relating to maintenance and repair of our facilities and the need to make expenditures due to changes in governmental regulations  including the americans with disabilities act  environmental hazards created by prior owners or occupants  existing tenants  mortgagors or other persons for which we may be liable  acts of god affecting our properties  and acts of terrorism affecting our properties 
our real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly 
in addition  some of our properties serve as collateral for our secured debt obligations and cannot be readily sold 
additional factors that are specific to our industry also tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
for example  all of our properties are special purpose properties that cannot be readily converted into general residential  retail or office use 
in addition  transfers of operations of nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate 
thus  if the operation of any of our properties becomes unprofitable due to competition  age of improvements or other factors such that our operator becomes unable to meet its obligations to us  then the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less  particularly relative to the amount owing on any related mortgage loan  than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses 
furthermore  the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator with a new operator licensed to manage the facility 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment  such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
should such events occur  our income and cash flows from operations would be adversely affected 
as an owner or lender with respect to real property  we may be exposed to possible environmental liabilities 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner of real property or a secured lender  such as us  may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of  or related releases of  certain hazardous or toxic substances at  under or disposed of in connection with such property  as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances  including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
such laws often impose liability based on the owner s knowledge of  or responsibility for  the presence or disposal of such substances 
as a result  liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property 
the cost of any required investigation  remediation  removal  fines or personal or property damages and the owner s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and or the assets of the owner 
in addition  the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances  may adversely affect an operators ability to attract additional residents and our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which  in turn  could negatively impact our revenues 
although our leases and mortgage loans require the lessee and the mortgagor to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities  the scope of such obligations may be limited 
for instance  most of our leases do not require the lessee to indemnify us for environmental liabilities arising before the lessee took possession of the premises 
further  we cannot assure you that any such mortgagor or lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

table of contents the industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
increasing investor interest in our sector and consolidation at the operator of reit level could increase competition and reduce our profitability 
our business is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future 
we compete for healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors  including other reits  some of which have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do 
increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals 
if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline  identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices  or if we are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if our cost of capital should increase relative to the cost of capital of our competitors  the spread that we realize on our investments may decline if competitive pressures limit or prevent us from charging higher lease or mortgage rates 
we may be named as defendants in litigation arising out of professional liability and general liability claims relating to our previously owned and operated facilities that if decided against us  could adversely affect our financial condition 
we and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries were named as defendants in professional liability and general liability claims related to our owned and operated facilities prior to other third party managers responsible for the day to day operations of these facilities were also named as defendants in these claims 
in these suits  patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged significant damages  including punitive damages  against the defendants 
although all of these prior suits have been settled  we or our affiliates could be named as defendants in similar suits related to our owned and operated assets resulting from the transition of the haven facilities as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations portfolio and other developments 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in our defense of such potential matters or in asserting our claims against various managers of the subject facilities or that the amount of any settlement or judgment would be substantially covered by insurance or that any punitive damages will be covered by insurance 
our charter and bylaws contain significant anti takeover provisions which could delay  defer or prevent a change in control or other transactions that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain various procedural and other requirements which could make it difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
our board of directors is divided into three classes and the members of our board of directors are elected for terms that are staggered 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the preferences  rights and limitations of the preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  which could adversely affect the market price of our securities and or result in the delay  deferral or prevention of a change in control or other transactions that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
we may change our investment strategies and policies and capital structure 
our board of directors  without the approval of our stockholders  may alter our investment strategies and policies if it determines that a change is in our stockholders best interests 
the methods of implementing our investment strategies and policies may vary as new investments and financing techniques are developed 
our success depends in part on our ability to retain key personnel and our ability to attract or retain other qualified personnel 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key employees 
the loss of the services of our current executive management team could have an adverse impact on our operations 
although we have entered into employment agreements with the members of our executive management team  these agreements may not assure their continued service 
in addition  our future success depends  in part  on our ability to attract  hire  train and retain other qualified personnel 
competition for qualified employees is intense  and we compete for qualified employees with companies with greater financial resources 
our failure to successfully attract  hire  retain and train the people we need would significantly impede our ability to implement our business strategy 

table of contents failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and stock price 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting  including management s assessment of the effectiveness of such control 
changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements due to inherent limitations  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls  or fraud 
therefore  even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
in addition  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  including any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or if we experience difficulties in their implementation  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed  we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price 
if we fail to maintain our reit status  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we were organized to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections through of the code 
we believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the code and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will maintain our qualification as a reit 
qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements  some on an annual and some on a quarterly basis  established under highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involve the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we cannot assure you that we will at all times satisfy these rules and tests 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  as a result of a determination that we failed to meet the annual distribution requirement or otherwise  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates with respect to each such taxable year for which the statute of limitations remains open 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 
this treatment would significantly reduce our net earnings and cash flow because of our additional tax liability for the years involved  which could significantly impact our financial condition 
we generally must distribute annually at least of our taxable income to our stockholders to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
even if we remain qualified as a reit  we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  property and transfer taxes 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for the payment of our debt obligations 
in addition  to meet reit qualification requirements  we may hold some of our non healthcare assets through taxable reit subsidiaries or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates 
qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code and complying with reit requirements may affect our profitability 
qualification as a reit involves the application of technical and intricate internal revenue code provisions 
even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the nature and diversification of our assets  the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders 
thus  we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments from our portfolio  or be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us  to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions 
we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution eg  if we have assets which generate mismatches between taxable income and available cash 
having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to i sell assets in adverse market conditions  ii borrow on unfavorable terms  or iii distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions  capital expenditures or repayment of debt 
as a result  satisfying the reit requirements could have an adverse effect on our business results and profitability 

table of contents risks related to our stock in addition to the risks related to our operators and our operations described above  the following are additional risks associated with our stock 
the market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors 
market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as with other publically traded securities  the share price of our stock depends on many factors  which may change from time to time  including the market for similar securities issued by reits  changes in estimates by analysts  our ability to meet analysts estimates  prevailing interest rates  our credit rating  general economic and market conditions  and our financial condition  performance and prospects 
our issuance of additional capital stock  warrants or debt securities  whether or not convertible  may reduce the market price for our outstanding securities  including our common stock  and dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our capital stock  warrants or debt securities  or the availability of our securities for future sale  will have on the market price of our securities  including our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or preferred shares  warrants or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales might occur  could negatively impact the market price of our stock and the terms upon which we may obtain additional equity financing in the future 
in addition  we may issue additional capital stock in the future to raise capital or as a result of the following the issuance and exercise of options to purchase our common stock or other equity awards under remuneration plans 
we may also issue equity to our employees in lieu of cash bonuses or to our directors in lieu of director s fees  the issuance of shares pursuant to our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  the issuance of debt securities exchangeable for our common stock  the exercise of warrants we may issue in the future  lenders sometimes ask for warrants or other rights to acquire shares in connection with providing financing  and wee cannot assure you that our lenders will not request such rights  and the sales of securities convertible into our common stock could dilute the interests of existing common stockholders 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in  our board of directors suspended dividends on shares of our common stock and all series of preferred stock in an effort to generate cash to address then impending debt maturities 
in  we paid all accrued but unpaid dividends on all shares of series of preferred stock and reinstated dividends on shares of our common stock and all series of preferred stock 
however  our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein were to occur 
our payment of dividends is subject to compliance with restrictions contained in our credit agreements  the indentures governing our senior notes and our preferred stock 
all dividends will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in addition  our dividends in the past have included  and may in the future include  a return of capital 

table of contents holders of our outstanding preferred stock have liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to designate and issue preferred stock that may have dividend  liquidation and other rights that are senior to those of our common stock 
as of the date of this filing   shares of our series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock series d preferred stock were issued and outstanding 
the aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding series d preferred stock is approximately million  and annual dividends on our outstanding series d preferred stock were approximately million 
holders of our series d preferred stock are generally entitled to cumulative dividends before any dividends may be declared or set aside on our common stock 
upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up  before any payment is made to holders of our common stock  holders of our series d preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of per share  plus any accrued and unpaid distributions 
this preference will reduce the remaining amount of our assets  if any  available to distribute to holders of our common stock 
in addition  holders of our series d preferred stock have the right to elect two additional directors to our board of directors if six quarterly preferred dividends are in arrears 
if this were to occur  the holders of our series d preferred stock would have significant control over our affairs  and their interests may differ from those of our other stockholders 
legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect purchasers of our stock 
in recent years  numerous legislative  judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of the federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock 
changes are likely to continue to occur in the future  and we cannot assure you that any of these changes will not adversely affect our stockholder s stock 
any of these changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on market value or resale potential 
stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisor with respect to the impact that recent legislation may have on their investment and the status of legislative  regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect 
a downgrade of our credit rating could impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable terms  if at all  and significantly reduce the trading price of our common stock 
our senior notes have credit ratings of ba from moody s investors service and bb from standard poor s ratings service 
if any of these rating agencies downgrade our credit rating  or place our rating under watch or review for possible downgrade  this could make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing  and the trading price of our common stock may decline 
factors that may affect our credit rating include  among other things  our financial performance  our success in raising sufficient equity capital  adverse changes in our debt and fixed charge coverage ratios  our capital structure and level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry 
we cannot assure you that these credit agencies will not downgrade our credit rating in the future

our portfolio of properties is broadly diversified by geographic location 
we have healthcare facilities located in states 
in addition  the majority of our rental and mortgage income was derived from facilities in states that require state approval for development and expansion of healthcare facilities 
we believe that such state approvals may limit competition for our operators and enhance the value of our properties

our facilities are operated by different public and private healthcare providers 
except for communicare and sun which together hold approximately of our portfolio by investment  no other single tenant holds greater than of our portfolio by investment

we also lease facilities under single facility leases 
the initial terms  on both type of leases  typically range from to years  plus renewal options 
substantially all of the leases provide for minimum annual rents that are subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or fixed rate increases

item legal proceedings in  we filed suit against a former tenant seeking damages based on claims of breach of contract 
the defendants denied the allegations made in the lawsuit 
in june  we were awarded damages in a jury trial 
the case was then settled prior to appeal 
in settlement of our claim against the defendants  we agreed in january to accept a lump sum cash payment of million 
the cash proceeds were offset by related expenses incurred of million  resulting in a net gain of million paid in january we recorded this gain during the first quarter of we and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries were named as defendants in professional liability claims related to our owned and operated facilities prior to other third party managers responsible for the day to day operations of these facilities have also been named as defendants in these claims 
in these suits  patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged significant damages  including punitive damages against the defendants 
while any legal proceeding or claim has an element of uncertainty  management believes that the outcome of each lawsuit  claim or legal proceeding that is pending or threatened  or all of them combined  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
all of these suits have been settled

the petition seeks a declaratory adjudication with respect to the identified claims above  a claim for specific performance permitting lct to exercise its rofr  and unspecified actual and punitive damages relating to breach of the master lease by the cse entities and tortious interference against us 
we believe that the litigation is defensible 
in addition  under the purchase agreement and related transaction documents  capitalsource has agreed to indemnify us for any losses  including reasonable legal expenses  incurred by us in connection with this litigation

our core business is to provide financing and capital to the long term healthcare industry with a particular focus on skilled nursing facilities located in the united states 
our core portfolio consists of long term leases and mortgage agreements 
all of our leases are triple net leases  which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses 
our mortgage revenue derives from fixed rate mortgage loans  which are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
in july  we assumed operating responsibilities for of our facilities due to the bankruptcy of one of our operator tenants 
in september  we entered into an agreement to lease these facilities to a new operator tenant 
the new operator tenant assumed operating responsibility for of the facilities effective september  we continue to be responsible for the two remaining facilities as of december  that are in the process of being transitioned to the new operator pending approval by state regulators

table of contents our portfolio of investments at december   consisted of healthcare facilities including two closed facilities held for sale  located in states and operated by third party operators

see portfolio and other developments for additional details 
the recent downturn in the us economy and other factors could result in significant cost cutting at both the federal and state levels  resulting in a reduction of reimbursement rates and levels to our operators under both the medicare and medicaid programs 
current market and economic conditions may have a significant impact on state budgets and health care spending 
the states with the most significant projected budget deficits in which we own facilities and the percentage of our gross investments in such states as of december  are as follows alabama  arizona  california  florida  new hampshire and rhode island 
these deficits  exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in medicaid due to rising unemployment levels and declining family incomes  could cause states to reduce state expenditures under their respective state medicaid programs by lowering reimbursement rates 
we currently believe that our operator coverage ratios are strong and that our operators can absorb moderate reimbursement rate reductions under medicaid and medicare and still meet their obligations to us 
however  significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an operator s results of operations and financial condition  which could adversely affect the operator s ability to meet its obligations to us

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december   were million  a decrease of approximately million over the same period in detailed changes in our operating expenses for the year ended december  versus the same period in are as follows our depreciation and amortization expense was million  compared to million for the same period in the increase is due to i the full year impact from acquisitions of seven snfs  one alf and one rehabilitation hospital in april  four snfs  one alf and one ilf in september and two snfs in december and ii the acquisitions of snfs in december our general and administrative expense  when excluding stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock units  was million  compared to million for the same period in our restricted stock based compensation expense was million  a decrease of million over the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the timing of the scheduled vesting of the performance stock portion of the stock plan

nursing home expenses of owned and operated assets was million in  a decrease of million over the same period in the decrease is due to the timing of ownership of the facilities in compared to see note organization and basis of presentation for additional information regarding the consolidation of this entity 
other income expense for the year ended december   our total other net expenses were million as compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily due to i a net increase of million associated with cash received for a legal settlement in compared to the same period of  and ii lower average outstanding borrowings and rates on credit facility  partially offset by i million associated with the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to replacing the former million credit facility during the second quarter of and ii million interest expense incurred on the million secured borrowings we entered into in december taxes so long as we qualify as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on the reit taxable income that we distribute to stockholders  subject to certain exceptions 
for tax year  preferred and common dividend payments of million made throughout satisfy the reit requirements relating to qualifying income 
we are permitted to own up to of a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
currently  we have one trs that is taxable as a corporation and that pays federal  state and local income tax on its net income at the applicable corporate rates 
the trs had a net operating loss carry forward as of december  of million 
the loss carry forward was fully reserved with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization 
we recorded interest and penalty charges associated with tax matters as income tax expense 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in income from continuing operations is the result of the factors described above 

table of contents discontinued operations discontinued operations generally relate to properties we disposed of or plan to dispose of and have no continuing involvement or cash flows with the operator

for the year ended december   discontinued operations include the one month revenue of thousand and a gain of million on the sale of one snf 
for additional information  see note discontinued operations 
funds from operations our funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo  for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the same period in we calculate and report ffo in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  and  consequently  ffo is defined as net income available to common stockholders  adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization 
we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue 
ffo herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo of other reits that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us 
we use ffo as one of several criteria to measure the operating performance of our business 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits

we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flow from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service payments  preferred stock dividends  common stock dividends  and growth through acquisitions of additional properties 
the primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows have historically been determined by i the number of facilities we lease or have mortgages on  ii rental and mortgage rates  iii our debt service obligations  and iv general and administrative expenses 
the timing  source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  especially to changes in interest rates 
changes in the capital markets environment may impact the availability of cost effective capital and affect our plans for acquisition and disposition activity 
current economic conditions reduced the availability of cost effective capital in recent quarters  and accordingly our level of new investments has decreased 
as economic conditions and capital markets stabilize  we look forward to funding new investments as conditions warrant 
however  we cannot predict the timing or level of future investments 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december   an increase of million as compared to the balance at december  the following is a discussion of changes in cash and cash equivalents due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
operating activities net cash flow from operating activities generated million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily due to i income from new investments made in  and ii in  we collected the cash used in to operate the facilities we assumed as a result of the bankruptcy of one of our former tenant operators in investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities was an outflow of million for the year ended december   as compared to an outflow of million for the same period in the increase in cash outflow from investing activities of million relates primarily to i acquisition of million in real estate and payment of million for a purchase option acquired compared to the acquisition of million in real estate and a million mortgage loan placed with one of our operators in  ii the investment of million in capital improvements and renovations in compared to million in  offset by i the decrease in net proceeds for the sales of real estate of million primarily related to the sale of two facilities in  ii the increase in net other investment in compared to and iii a net decrease in collection of mortgage principal of million in compared to financing activities net cash flow from financing activities was an inflow of million for the year ended december  as compared to an inflow of million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in cash inflow from financing activities was primarily due to i million in secured borrowings issued to fund a portion of the new investments acquired in  ii a net proceeds of approximately million from our credit facilities primarily related to the funding of the new investment  compared to a net proceeds from our credit facility of approximately million in  iii million net proceeds from our common stocks issued through the equity shelf program  offset by iv million in payments of deferred financing costs associated with the credit facility and ge term loan in  v a decrease in net proceeds from the common stock offering of million  vi an increase in dividend payments of million in due to additional shares outstanding  vii a decrease in dividend reinvestment proceeds of million due to the temporary suspension of the optional cash purchase component our drspp in october which was later reinstated in may and viii the retirement of approximately million in other borrowings primarily related to the haven mortgage 
in  we also paid million to purchase a portion of our series d preferred stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified four significant accounting policies that we believe are critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant assumptions  judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  we believe the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the four critical accounting policies are revenue recognition we have various different investments that generate revenue  including leased and mortgaged properties  as well as  other investments  including working capital loans 
we recognized rental income and mortgage interest income and other investment income as earned over the terms of the related master leases and notes  respectively 
substantially all of our leases contain provisions for specified annual increases over the rents of the prior year and are generally computed in one of three methods depending on specific provisions of each lease as follows i a specific annual increase over the prior year s rent  generally  ii an increase based on the change in pre determined formulas from year to year ie  such as increases in the consumer price index cpi  or iii specific dollar increases over prior years 
revenue under lease arrangements with fixed and determinable increases is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight line basis 
the authoritative guidance does not provide for the recognition of contingent revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
we consider the operating history of the lessee  the payment history  the general condition of the industry and various other factors when evaluating whether all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
we do not include contingent rents as income until the contingencies are resolved 

table of contents in the case of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis  we generally record reserves against earned revenues from leases when collection becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators result in significant uncertainty regarding ultimate collection 
the amount of the reserve is estimated based on what management believes will likely be collected 
we continually evaluate the collectability of our straight line rent assets 
if it appears that we will not collect future rent due under our leases  we will record a provision for loss related to the straight line rent asset 
recognizing rental income on a straight line basis may cause recognized revenue to exceed contractual amounts due from our tenants 
such cumulative excess amounts are included in accounts receivable and were million and million  net of allowances  at december  and  respectively 
gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized under the fasb guidance of accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the recognition of the sale and the related gain is measured against the various criteria in the guidance related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement associated with the assets sold 
to the extent the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition until the sales criteria are met 
nursing home revenues of owned and operated assets consist of long term care revenues  rehabilitation therapy services revenues  temporary medical staffing services revenues and other ancillary services revenues 
the revenues are recognized as services are provided 
revenues are recorded net of provisions for discount arrangements with commercial payors and contractual allowances with third party payors  primarily medicare and medicaid 
revenues realizable under third party payor agreements are subject to change due to examination and retroactive adjustment 
estimated third party payor settlements are recorded in the period the related services are rendered 
the methods of making such estimates are reviewed periodically  and differences between the net amounts accrued and subsequent settlements or estimates of expected settlements are reflected in the current period results of operations 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
for additional information  see note owned and operated assets 
depreciation and asset impairment under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years for buildings and improvements and three to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
management periodically  but not less than annually  evaluates our real estate investments for impairment indicators  including the evaluation of our assets useful lives 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as  but not limited to  market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if indicators of impairment are present  management evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities 
provisions for impairment losses related to long lived assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows are determined to be permanently less than the carrying values of the assets 
an adjustment is made to the net carrying value of the leased properties and other long lived assets for the excess of historical cost over fair value 
the fair value of the real estate investment is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
all impairments are taken as a period cost at that time  and depreciation is adjusted going forward to reflect the new value assigned to the asset 
if we decide to sell rental properties or land holdings  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell 
our estimates of cash flows and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties  and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively  including amounts classified within discontinued operations 
the impairments are primarily the result of closing facilities or updating the estimated proceeds we expect for the sale of closed facilities 

table of contents loan impairment management  periodically but not less than annually  evaluates our outstanding loans and notes receivable 
when management identifies potential loan impairment indicators  such as non payment under the loan documents  impairment of the underlying collateral  financial difficulty of the operator or other circumstances that may impair full execution of the loan documents  and management believes it is probable that all amounts will not be collected under the contractual terms of the loan  the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows 
in cases where expected future cash flows are not readily determinable  the loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the loan is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
we account for impaired loans using a the cost recovery method  and or b the cash basis method 
we generally utilize the cost recovery method for impaired loans for which impairment reserves were recorded 
we utilize the cash basis method for impairment loans for which no impairment reserves were recorded because the net present value of the discounted cash flows and or the underlying collateral supporting the loan were equal to or exceeded the book value of the loans 
under the cost recovery method  we apply cash received against the outstanding loan balance prior to recording interest income 
under the cash basis method  we apply cash received to interest income 
as of december  and  we had loan loss reserve totaling million  in both periods 
in  and we did not record provisions for loan losses or charge offs related to our mortgage or note receivable portfolios 
for additional information see note mortgage notes receivable and note other investments 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations the operating results of specified real estate assets that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for disposition  are reflected as assets held for sale in our balance sheet 
assets that qualify as held for sale may also be considered as a discontinued operation if  a the operation and cash flows of the asset have been or will be eliminated from future operations and b we will not have significant involvement with the asset after its disposition 
for assets that qualify as discontinued operations  we have reclassified the operations of those assets to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented and assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented 
we had two assets held for sale as of december  with a net book value of million neither of which are classified as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   we had one asset held for sale with a net book value of million 
discontinued operations includes the one month revenue of thousand and the gain of million on the sale of one snf 
for the year ended december   we had three assets held for sale with a combined net book value of million 
discontinued operations includes the revenue of million and expense of thousand for facilities 
it also includes the gain of million on the sale of six snfs and two alfs 
effects of recently issued accounting standards determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities in june  the fasb issued guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
in this new guidance  the fasb concluded that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents that participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and  accordingly  are considered participating securities that shall be included in the two class method of computing basic and diluted eps 
the guidance does not address awards that contain rights to forfeitable dividends 
we adopted this standard on january   and retrospectively adjusted basic eps data for all periods presented to reflect the two class method of computing eps 
the impact of the adoption of this guidance on earnings per share was less than per share for the periods presented 
determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly in april  the fasb issued guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
this new guidance provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with fair value measurements  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
this new guidance also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
it emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation technique s used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
we adopted the standard in the second quarter of and determined that the adoption had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents fair value measurements on january   we adopted new guidance for fair value measurements 
this new guidance defines fair value  establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements 
it emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the guidance applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
the standard applies prospectively to new fair value measurements performed after the required effective dates  which are as follows i on january   the standard applied to our measurements of the fair values of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of non financial assets and liabilities  and ii on january   the standard applied to all remaining fair value measurements  including non recurring measurements of non financial assets and liabilities such as measurement of potential impairments of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
it also applies to fair value measurements of non financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations 
we evaluated the guidance and determined that the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revised business combinations on december   the fasb issued revised guidance on business combinations 
the new guidance will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions 
the guidance requires companies to recognize  with certain exception  percent of the fair value of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and non controlling interest in acquisitions of less than a percent controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control  measure acquirer shares issued as consideration for a business combination at fair value on the date of the acquisition  recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair value  with subsequent change in fair value generally reflected in earnings  recognition of reacquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair value  and expense as incurred  acquisition related transaction costs 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is prohibited 
we adopted the guidance on january   which will impact the accounting only for acquisitions occurring prospectively 
we incurred million associated with the capitalsource transaction 
subsequent events in the second quarter of  we adopted fasb new guidance on subsequent events 
the new guidance establishes the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  but we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long term fixed rate borrowing to the extent possible 
the following disclosures of estimated fair value of financial instruments are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of important assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows  risks  discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument 
readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in these paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
the use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts 
accordingly  the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange 

table of contents mortgage notes receivable the fair value of mortgage notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities 
notes receivable the fair value of notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities 
borrowings under variable rate agreements our variable rate debt as of december  includes our credit facility  our million term loan  and million of mortgage debt assumed from capitalsource that was paid off subsequent to year end 
the fair value of our borrowings under variable rate agreements are estimated using an expected present value technique based on expected cash flows discounted using the current credit adjusted risk free rate 
senior unsecured notes the fair value of the senior unsecured notes is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current borrowing rate available for the similar debt 
the market value of our long term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages is subject to interest rate risks 
generally  the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
the estimated fair value of our total long term borrowings at december  was approximately million 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million at december  the estimated fair value of our total long term borrowings at december  was approximately million  and a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million 
while we currently do not engage in hedging strategies  we may engage in such strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies
