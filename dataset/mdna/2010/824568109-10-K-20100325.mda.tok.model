this change also positively contributed to our compliance with the fsl  as our food packaging operations are conducted in the same facility 
we had a favorable response from all customers except libai 
the environmentally friendly ink is more expensive than benzene based ink and libai would not accept the price change after several attempts to persuade them 
thus  we terminated the libai account 
lidun accepted the use of non benzene ink and associated price increase and remains a satisfied customer 
the loss of guangzhou libai enterprise group as a customer accounted for a decrease million in our cost of goods sold

recent accounting pronouncements on july   we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 topic generally accepted accounting principles amendments based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asu no 

asu no 
re defines authoritative gaap for nongovernmental entities to be only comprised of the fasb accounting standards codification codification and  for sec registrants  guidance issued by the sec 
the codification is a reorganization and compilation of all then existing authoritative gaap for nongovernmental entities  except for guidance issued by the sec 
the codification is amended to effect non sec changes to authoritative gaap 
adoption of asu no 
only changed the referencing convention of gaap in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 accounting for own share lending arrangements in contemplation of convertible debt issuance 
this asu requires that at the date of issuance of the shares in a share lending arrangement entered into in contemplation of a convertible debt offering or other financing  the shares issued shall be measured at fair value and be recognized as an issuance cost  with an offset to additional paid in capital 
further  loaned shares are excluded from basic and diluted earnings per share unless default of the share lending arrangement occurs  at which time the loaned shares would be included in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation 
this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years for arrangements outstanding as of the beginning of those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this asu requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in codification subtopic the fasb s objective is to improve these disclosures and  thus  increase the transparency in financial reporting 
the adoption of this asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  however  we believe those risks to be not material in relation to our operations 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk as of december   we held no money market securities or short term available for sale marketable securities 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our revenues are denominated in rmb and  as a result  we have certain exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to current revenues 
a majority of our expenses are payable in foreign currency 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
