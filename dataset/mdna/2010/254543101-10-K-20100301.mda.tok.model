highlights for the year ended december  net sales for increased to million  an increase from million in  which included seven months of zetex revenues  gross profit for was million  or of net sales  net income attributable to common stockholders was million 
on november   the credit line on our no net cost loan from ubs bank usa ubs bank was increased to the full value of our ars portfolio  and during  we repurchased million principal amount of our convertible senior notes due notes for approximately million in cash and million principal amount of our notes for approximately million in shares of common stock 
business outlook for we expect to see improvements in demand and order rates  increased production of previous design wins at new customers  the introduction of new product applications for existing customers and improved capacity utilization primarily at our wafer fabrication facilities 
in addition  we expect our business to continue to benefit from the increasing demand in china  as we consider the china market a major growth driver for our business 
our strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a leading global manufacturer and supplier of high quality semiconductor products  and to continue to add other complementary product lines  such as power management products  using our packaging technology capability 
the success of our business depends  among other factors  on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  which in term affect our customers demand for our products  the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders and end user consumers demand for items containing our products in the end markets we serve 
we believe the long term outlook for our business remains generally favorable despite the recent volatility in the equity and credit markets as we continue to execute on the strategy that has proven successful for us over the years 
although the current economy creates a more challenging environment for all businesses  we believe the decisive measures taken in response to the global economic downturn  including our cost reduction initiative  have properly positioned us for our recent return to a profitable growth model and that over the long term we are well positioned for future growth 
see risk factors the success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
overview at the end of and in the beginning of  we saw a slowdown in global economic activity and a decrease in global demand for our products and  therefore  implemented cost reduction initiatives and focused on cash flows from operations 
during the first quarter of  we strengthened our inventory position  completed the cost reduction initiatives and continued to focus on cash flows from operations 
during the second and third quarters of  as we continued to focus on cash flows  we saw continued improvements in demand and order rates  increased production of previous design wins at new customers  introduced new product applications for existing customers and improved capacity utilization primarily at our packaging facilities  which were near full utilization by the end of the third quarter 
during the fourth quarter of  our business continued to benefit from the continued strength in china  combined with general improvements in north america and europe and improved capacity utilization at our wafer fabrication facilities 
while cash preservation was the focus during most of  in the fourth quarter of  we resumed certain expenditures  such as authorizations for capital expenditures  to their normal range of to of net sales 
although was a turbulent year due to global economic factors  our long term strategy has never changed and for  we look to continue to enhance our position as a leading global manufacturer and supplier of high quality semiconductor products  and to continue to add other complementary product lines  such as power management products  using our packaging technology capability 
as described in business our strategy in part i  item of this annual report  the principal elements of our strategy include the following continue to rapidly introduce innovative discrete and analog semiconductor products  expand our available market opportunities  maintain intense customer focus  enhance cost competitiveness  and pursue selective strategic acquisitions 
in implementing this strategy  the following factors have affected  and  we believe  will continue to affect  our results of operations although we have seen increased demand for our products during  the recent economic downturn has affected our results in which we did not sustain our historical growth rate 
for  we anticipate continued improvement in demand and order rates and improvements in capacity utilization at our wafer fabrication facilities 
for the years ended december   and  our original equipment manufactures oem and electronic manufacturing services ems customers together accounted for  and of total sales  respectively  while our global network of distributors accounted for  and of total sales  respectively 
we have experienced substantial pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the selling price of our products 
see risk factors we are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products  which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
as we look forward to  we expect any future improvements in net income to result primarily from increases in sales volume and improvements in product mix 
sales of new products products that have been sold for three years or less for the years ended december   and amounted to  and of total sales  respectively  including the contribution of recent acquisitions 
the sale of new products for were lower than those for and due primarily to a portion of our analog product revenue from anachip corp 
developed in and earlier no longer being included in the overall calculation for new products for as these products were developed more then three years ago 
although sales of new products were lower in compared to  we have seen recent improvements  primarily in the led drivers  hall effect sensors  sbr devices and bi polar products 
new products generally have gross profit margins that are higher than the margins of our standard products 
we believe the sales from new products is an important measure given the short life cycles of some of our products 
our net sales of new products as a percentage of our net sales will depend on the demand for our standard products  as well as our product mix 
see risk factors obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
our gross profit margin was in  compared to in and in our gross profit margin decrease in was affected by lower capacity utilization at our manufacturing operations primarily due to the recent economic downturn and the decrease in demand for our products 
future gross profit margins will depend primarily on our utilization  product mix  cost savings  and the demand for our products 
during the first quarter of  the capacity utilization at our packaging facilities decreased to approximately  but has since improved to full capacity utilization by the end of in addition  during the third and fourth quarter of  we have seen improvements in our capacity utilization at our wafer fabrication facilities and expect further improvements in utilization going into for  the percentage of our net sales derived from our asian subsidiaries was  compared to in and in we expect our net sales to the asian market to increase as a percentage of our total net sales as a result of our customers continuing to shift their manufacturing of electronic products to asia 
as a result of the zetex acquisition we have added significant revenue in europe 
as such  europe accounted for approximately and of our revenues in and  respectively 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in our manufacturing facilities in china 
during  we invested approximately million in these manufacturing facilities  and we expect to continue to invest in our manufacturing facilities  although the amount to be invested will depend on product demand and new product developments 
for  our capital expenditures were approximately of our net sales  which is a reduction from our historical to model but in line with our cost reduction initiatives implemented in the first quarter of while cash preservation was our focus during most of  for  we intend to resume capital expenditures to their normal range of to of net sales 
we increased our investment in research and development from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the zetex acquisition 
in  research and development expenses were approximately of net sales 
for  we expect research and development to increase in absolute dollars as we anticipate continued improvement in demand but remain comparable as a percentage of net sales 
convertible senior notes on october   we issued and sold notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due  which pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  the notes will be convertible into cash or  at our option  cash and shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares split adjusted per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of per share  split adjusted  in certain circumstances 
in addition  following a make whole fundamental change that occurs prior to october   we will  at our option  increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such make whole fundamental change  in certain circumstances 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of the notes for approximately million in cash 
during  we repurchased million principal amount of the notes for approximately million in cash and million principal amount of the notes in exchange for approximately million in shares of common stock 
as of december   we have repurchased a total of million principal amount of notes 
on january   we changed how we accounted for our notes as a change in accounting principle 
the change in accounting principle required all adjustments to be made retrospectively as of the date of issuance for the notes and therefore  all periods presented reflect the retrospective adjustments 
the notes may be settled for cash upon conversion 
as such  we allocated a portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of the notes between a liability and equity component by determining the fair value of the liability component using our nonconvertible borrowing rate 
the difference between the proceeds of the notes and the fair value of the liability component was recorded as a discount on the debt with a corresponding offset to additional paid in capital 
the resulting debt discount is amortized as additional non cash interest expense  which we refer to as amortization of debt discount  over the expected life of the notes using the effective interest method

as of december   we were in compliance with the bank covenants 
on november   we accepted an offer of a no net cost loan with ubs bank  which is collateralized by our ars portfolio 
the no net cost loan initially allowed us to draw up to of the market value of our ars portfolio  as determined by the ubs bank 
under the no net cost loan  the interest rate we pay on the no net cost loan will not exceed the interest rate earned on the pledged ars portfolio 
subsequent to the agreement  we drew up to the market value limit as determined by ubs bank 
on november   we received a credit line of up to the full par value of our ars portfolio 
subsequently  we drew up to the full value or million of the credit line 
as of december   the balance of the no net cost loan was million and classified as short term debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and risk factors restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities  including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future 
in part  item a of this annual report for additional information 
as of december   our asia and europe subsidiaries have available lines of credit of up to an aggregate of approximately million  with several financial institutions 
these lines of credit  except for one taiwanese credit facility  are collateralized by each subsidiary s premises  are unsecured  uncommitted and  in some instances  may be repayable on demand 
loans under these lines of credit bear interest at libor or similar indices plus a specified margin 
at december   million was outstanding on these lines of credit  and the interest rates ranged from to 
in october   we issued and sold notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due  which pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  interest will accrue on the notes from and including october  or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for  as the case may be  to  but excluding  the next interest payment date or maturity date  as the case may be 
commencing with the six month period beginning october   and for each six month period thereafter  we will  on the interest payment date for such interest period  pay contingent interest to the holders of the notes under certain circumstances and in amounts described in the indenture 
for us federal income tax purposes  we treat  and each holder of the notes agreed under the indenture to treat  the notes as contingent payment debt instruments governed by special tax rules and to be bound by our application of those rules to the notes 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of the notes for approximately million in cash 
during  we repurchased million principal amount of the notes for approximately million in cash and million principal amount of the notes in exchange for approximately million in shares of common stock 
as of december   we have repurchased a total of million principal amount of notes 
on january   we changed how we accounted for our notes as a change in accounting principle 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report for additional information 
we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that will affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose entities that provided off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support  nor do we engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services  that could expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of our financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital leases operating leases defined benefit obligations purchase obligations total obligations on each of october   october  and october   holders of our notes may require the company to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the purchase date 
note the table does not include the no net cost loan from ubs bank as it is currently classified as short term debt 
tax liabilities are not included in the above contractual obligations as we can not make reasonable estimates of the amount and period in which those tax liabilities would be paid 
see accounting for income taxes below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report for additional information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when delivery has occurred  when the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers  which is generally when product is shipped to the customers 
generally  the company recognizes revenue for sales to distributors using the sell in model  which is when product is sold to the distributor 
certain distributors and other customers have limited rights of return and or are entitled to price adjustments on inventory held in the distributors stock or upon sale to end customers 
the company reduces revenue in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances  the majority of which are related to our us operations 
our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of revenues  distributor inventories  price adjustments  average selling prices and market conditions 
actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in an adjustment to revenues 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory  both finished goods and raw materials  for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections  and purchases by item  as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities 
if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value  we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets by jurisdiction to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires the consideration of the reversal of temporary differences between book and tax basis  the projection of our taxable income into future years and the use of tax planning strategies to determine if it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax assets 
this analysis requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
we are involved in various tax matters  some of whose outcome is uncertain 
for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain i we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  ii technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and iii each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits  and the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefits that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors  including the current business environment and historical experience 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense 
goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  on october  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the fair value of the reporting units was calculated using the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting units was calculated by estimating the present value of associated future cash flows 
under the market approach  the fair value was calculated using the guideline public company method and the mergers and acquisitions method 
we determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of units  thus indicating that the goodwill was not impaired as of october  we assess the impairment of certain long lived assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value using a discounted cash flow analysis 
share based compensation we use the black scholes merton model to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the black scholes merton model requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including the grant price  the expected future volatility  the expected term of the option and the risk free interest rate of the option 
the expected term and expected future volatility of the options require our judgment 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock options expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  share based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
restricted stock grants are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
fair value measurements we use the methods of fair value to value our ars portfolio 
fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an assets or liability 
fair value is based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques  which is determined on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
these two types of inputs create a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as following level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
due to lack of observable market quotes on our ars portfolio and put option  we utilized a valuation model that relies exclusively on level inputs including those that are based on factors that reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing  including  among others relevant future market conditions including those that are based on the expected cash flow streams  the underlying financial condition and credit quality of the issuer and bond insurer  the percent of the federal family education loan program ffelp guaranty  and the maturity of the securities  as well as the market activity of similar securities 
the valuation of our ars investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit rating of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
in addition  our defined benefit plan assets are valued under methods of fair value 
all of the securities held by the plan are publically traded and highly liquid 
therefore  the majority of the securities are valued under level and one security is valued under level using quoted prices for identical or similar securities 
defined benefit plan we maintain a pension plan covering certain of our employees in the uk and germany 
for financial reporting purposes  the net pension and supplemental retirement benefit obligations and the related periodic pension costs are calculated based upon  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate for plan obligations  estimated return on pension plan assets and mortality rates 
these obligations and related periodic costs are measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
the projected unit credit method is the actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expenses 
see fair value measurements above in regard to pension plan assets 
contingencies from time to time  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on information available  we evaluate the likelihood of potential outcomes 
we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  we do not accrue for estimated legal fees and other directly related costs as they are expensed as incurred 
convertible senior notes on january   we changed how we accounted for our notes as a change in accounting principle 
the change in accounting principle required all adjustments to be made retrospectively as of the date of issuance for the notes and  therefore  all periods presented reflect the retrospective adjustments 
our notes may be settled for cash upon conversion 
as such  we allocated a portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of the notes between a liability and equity component by determining the fair value of the liability component using our nonconvertible borrowing rate 
the effective rate of the liability component was determined by obtaining a comparable yield for nonconvertible notes with terms and conditions comparable to our notes as of the date of issuance 
the difference between the proceeds of the notes and the fair value of the liability component was recorded as a discount on the debt with a corresponding offset to additional paid in capital 
the resulting debt discount is amortized as additional non cash interest expense  which we refer to as amortization of debt discount  over the expected life of the notes using the effective interest method

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia and europe 
our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have a material adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar and the british pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  the japanese yen  the euro and the hong kong dollar 
if the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling were to strengthen or weaken by against the us dollar  we would experience currency gain or loss of approximately million 
in the future  we may enter into hedging arrangements designed to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations 
the chinese government permits the chinese yuan to float more freely compared to other world currencies 
should the chinese government allow a significant chinese yuan appreciation  and we do not take appropriate means to offset this exposure  the effect could have a material adverse impact upon our financial results 
we have a contributory defined benefit plan that covers certain employees in the uk and germany 
the defined benefit plan is closed to new entrants and frozen with respect to future benefit accruals 
the retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee 
december is our annual measurement date and on measurement date  defined benefit plan assets are determined based on fair value 
defined benefit plan assets consist primarily of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability 
the net pension and supplemental retirement benefit obligations and the related periodic costs are based on  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate  estimated return on plan assets and mortality rates 
these obligations and related periodic costs are measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
the projected unit credit method is the actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expenses 
as of december   the plan is underfunded and a liability of million is reflected in our consolidated financial statements as noncurrent liabilities 
the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income was a net loss of million and the weighted average discount rate assumption used to determine benefit obligations as of december  was 
a increase decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the net period benefit cost for the year would reduce annual benefit cost by million 
a increase decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the year end projected benefit obligation would increase decrease the year end projected benefit obligation by million 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical and expected future returns of the various assets classes and as such  each increase decrease in the expected rate of return assumption would increase decrease the net period benefit cost by million 
the asset value of the defined benefit plan has been volatile in recent months due primarily to wide fluctuations in the uk equity markets and bond markets 
see risk factors due to the recent fluctuations in the united kingdom s equity markets and bond markets  changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan s asset value  require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
interest rate risk 
we have credit facilities with financial institutions in the us  asia and europe as well as other debt instruments with interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense 
as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
as of december   our outstanding debt under our interest bearing credit agreements was million  including million principal amount of convertible notes with a fixed interest rate of and million under our no net cost loan 
based on an increase or decrease in interest rates by for the year  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately million due to the fact that any increase in interest expense related to our no net cost loan will be offset by interest earned on our ars portfolio 
political risk 
we have a significant portion of our assets in mainland china  taiwan and the uk the possibility of political conflict between the any of these countries or with the us could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to transact business through these important business channels and to generate profits 
see risk factors risks related to our international operations in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
inflation risk 
inflation did not have a material effect on net sales or net income in fiscal year a significant increase in inflation could affect future performance 
credit risk 
the success of our business depends  among other factors  on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  which in turn affect our customers demand for our products  the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders and end user consumers demand for items containing our products in the end markets we serve 
we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by dispersion of our customers over various geographic areas  operating primarily in electronics manufacturing and distribution 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks
