item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
references made to years are for fiscal year periods 
dollar amounts are in thousands  except share and per share data and as indicated 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations  financial position  cash flows  indebtedness  and other key financial information of joy global inc and its subsidiaries for   and for a more complete understanding of this discussion  please read the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
overview we have been manufacturing mining equipment for over years 
we operate in two business segments underground mining machinery  comprised of our joy mining machinery business and surface mining equipment  comprised of our p h mining equipment business 
joy is a leading producer of high productivity underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal 
p h is the world s largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a major producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills  used primarily for surface mining of copper  coal  iron ore  oil sands  and other minerals 
in addition to selling original equipment  we provide parts  components  repairs  rebuilds  diagnostic analysis  training  and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines 
in the case of surface mining equipment  we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies  including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as alliance partners 
we emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business 
operating results bookings for were billion  an increase of from billion  excluding million and million of order cancellations for original equipment and aftermarket parts and service  respectively  in the bookings included the million favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the increase in bookings consisted of a million increase in original equipment and million increase in aftermarket parts and service 
the increase in both original equipment and aftermarket orders reflects our customers commitment to both brown field and green field projects as the global demand for commodities continues to increase  most significantly in emerging markets 
net sales for totaled billion  compared with billion in  and included a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the decrease in net sales was the result of a million decrease in original equipment shipments  partially offset by million increase in aftermarket parts and service 
in  shipments increased on declining order rates as we reduced backlog while meeting scheduled delivery dates 
net sales for the underground equipment business decreased by in compared to  while net sales for the surface mining equipment business increased by 
operating income was million in  compared to million in and included a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of decreased sales volumes and increased retiree benefit costs of million 
these unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable pricing realization and the mix of products sold  decreased material input costs and elimination of severance and related expenses of million recorded in net income was million or per diluted share in  compared with million or per diluted share in page 
index market outlook the commodity end markets have strong fundamentals and a positive outlook despite slow economic recovery in the industrialized countries and slower growth in the emerging markets  particularly china  which results from efforts to balance economic growth while containing inflation 
after recovering beginning in the second half of and continuing into  copper demand hit an all time high in june of and continues to run well above its prior five year range 
this was not driven by china alone  and in fact  china demand has leveled from while demand from the rest of the world has increased significantly since the beginning of copper prices have moved steadily up during in response to both increasing demand and limited capacity to expand mine production in the near term 
the longer term outlook is further impacted by the continued trend of declining ore grades 
the seaborne demand for both thermal and metallurgical coal continues to be driven by china  india  and the other emerging markets 
china continues to import coal at an annualized rate of more than million metric tons  up from imports of million metric tons last year 
india also continues to import more coal  with its imports expected to triple during the next five years 
in addition to emerging market demand  coal burn has been increasing in europe and stockpiles there have been drawn down 
seaborne thermal coal prices have been increasing on the projection that continued demand growth from the emerging markets will keep supply under pressure 
u 
s 
coal production year to date is flat with last year  but with an improving trend in more recent months 
based on the recent trend  coal demand is on pace to recover from last year 
in addition  the favorable us dollar exchange rate is increasing export opportunities for both thermal and metallurgical coal 
us coal production has been restricted by safety and permitting issues and is mostly flat while demand continues to improve 
this has resulted in increasing prices across all regions since the first of this year 
similar to copper  global demand in for iron ore and metallurgical coal has come mostly from increases in steel production outside of china 
prices for both metallurgical coal and iron ore have been rising in recent months and should see continued upward pressure as demand growth resumes from the emerging markets 
china has started to relax power rationing in the major steel making province of hebei  and this resulted in steel production increases in october 
in addition  india s imports of metallurgical and thermal coal are expected to rebound after weather related slowing 
inventories in the industrial sector of the developed countries were substantially reduced during as companies adjusted to lower demand volumes  and the replenishment of those inventories will add further upside to commodity demand as economic recovery continues 
in addition  china and india have included significant infrastructure programs in their next five year plans 
india plans to spend billion over the next three years for infrastructure projects 
a major focus will be on power generation  with capacity additions expected to double by china s plan focuses on the development of the western provinces and on second and third tier cities 
fixed asset investment is targeted to gro w at per year and includes the build out of the electricity grid in the western provinces  which alone could add a million tons to annual copper demand 
based on this outlook  mining companies are realizing strong demand and prices  with the expectation of significant increases in demand during the next to years 
as a result  they are making major increases in their capital expenditures for mine expansions 
mining companies have announced capital expenditures that are up to this year  and are approaching the levels of in addition  announced capital expenditures for are expected to rise another to 
company outlook our outlook is defined by increases in mine production rates as the end use demand for commodities continues to improve and by significant increases in mining company capital budgets as they begin expansion programs to meet higher levels of future demand 
our order rates for original equipment are correlated with the growth in mining company capital expenditures  and therefore the increase in mining company capital budgets provides a strong outlook for mining equipment 
mining companies are transitioning their focus from expanding existing mine capacity to adding major new mines  or from brown field to green field projects  as a major part of their increased capital expenditures 
the green field projects are generally larger  and often involve multiple machines  and this is increasing the list of quali fied machine prospects that we track 
this list has been increasing during the year  and continued the upward trend in the fourth quarter 
green field projects have longer lead times  and are unlikely to start reaching equipment decisions until later in the transition from brown field to green field projects could constrain order rate growth over the next couple of quarters 
page 
index we are increasing our production schedules to keep pace with growing customer demand 
based on both market fundamentals and the discussions directly with our customers  we are confident that this is the early stage of another multi year expansion of the mining industry 
therefore we are also stepping up our own capital spending to ensure we will have the machines that our customers will need in their expansion programs 
more importantly  we want to get this capacity in as early as possible to enable its utilization as industry growth unfolds

net reorganization items for   and consisted of the following in thousands beloit uk claim settlement beloit uk receivership settlement professional fees directly related to the reorganization and other net reorganization expense income critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  excess inventory  warranty  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be re asonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the accounting policies described below are the policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on aftermarket products and services when the following criteria are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and title transfer has occurred or the services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on long term contracts  such as for the manufacture of mining shovels  drills  draglines  roof support systems and conveyor systems  using the percentage of completion method 
we generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method for original equipment 
when using the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
 sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
estimated losses are recognized in full when identified 
approximately of our sales in were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service  with the remaining of sales recorded using percentage of completion accounting 
we have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of to years 
these contracts are established based on the conditions the equipment will be operating in  the time horizon that the program will cover  and the expected operating cycle that will be required for the equipment 
based on this information  a model is created representing the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms 
accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates  including estimates of the relevant machine s long term maintenance requirements 
under these contracts  customers are generally billed monthly based on hours of operation or units of production achieved by the equipment  with the respecti ve deferred revenues recorded when billed 
revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided 
these contracts are reviewed quarterly by comparison of actual results to original estimates or most recent analysis  with revenue recognition adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs 
if a loss is expected at any time  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
page 
index we have certain customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the accounting standards codification asc no 
multiple element arrangements 
the agreements are assessed for multiple elements based on the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values 
revenue recognition involves judgments  including assessments of expected returns  the likelihood of nonpayment  and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions  in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in  first out method for all inventories 
we evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis 
our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts 
inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses  and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include drawings  patents  trademarks  technology  customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
as part of the impairment analysis  we use the discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were we to license the use of the trademark or tradename 
no impairment was identified as part of our fourth quarter impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  which is principally the straight line method 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value 
no impairment was identified related to our finite lived intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units  which we have identified as our operating segments  and tested for impairment at least annually  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach  in accordance with asc no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
the determination of an impairment requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit  which we estimate using the discounted cash flow model and market approach 
the discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions  including operating results forecasts and discount rates 
inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of and no impairment was identified 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units would not cause the carrying value of the respective reporting unit to exceed its fair value 
page 
index accrued warranties we record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
pension and postretirement benefits and costs pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and rate of compensation increases  discussed below discount rates we generally estimate the discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using a process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
we believe this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes 
our analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  however  the assumptions are primarily based on long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality rates mortality rates are based on the rp mortality table 
rate of compensation increase the rate of compensation increase reflects our long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense 
future changes affecting the above assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense 
as such  a change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense  respectively  as of and for the fiscal year ended october  increase decrease expected expected discount long term discount long term in thousands rate rate of return rate rate of return u

index income taxes deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates 
deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period 
additionally  we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria 
as required under the application of fresh start accounting  the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted  then intangibles until exhausted  and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital 
consequently  a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized 
we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained 
as of october   there were million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards 
all future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of in millions october  october  accounts receivable inventories accounts payable advance payments trade working capital other current assets short term notes payable employee compensation and benefits accrued warranties other current liabilities working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents working capital we currently use trade working capital and cash flow from operations as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we require trade working capital investment because our service model requires us to maintain certain inventory levels in order to maximize our customers machine reliability 
this information also provides management with a focus on our receivable terms and collectability efforts and our ability to obtain advance payments on original equipment orders 
as part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes  we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules 
cash provided by operations for was million as compared to million provided by operations for cash provided by operations was unfavorably impacted by increased contributions to retiree benefit plans of million and an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of cash provided by operations was favorably impacted by increased customer advance payments due to original equipment bookings in excess of shipments  and increased accounts payable due to process improvements

index new accounting pronouncements our new accounting pronouncements are set forth under item exhibits and financial statements schedules of this annual report and are incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk volatility in commodity price risk and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings  equity  and cash flow 
from time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact 
a hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings  equity  and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest  commodity  and foreign exchange rates 
in accordance with our policy  we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from commodity price or foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
commodity price risk we purchase certain raw materials  including steel and copper  that are subject to price volatility caused by systematic risks 
although future movements in raw material prices are unpredictable  we manage this risk through periodic purchases of raw materials and passing some or all price increases to our customers 
at october   we were not a party to any commodity forward contracts 
foreign currency risk our significant foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency 
for consolidation purposes  assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates 
items of income and expense are translated at average exchange rates 
translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income loss but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity 
gains losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income loss 
during  we realized a gain of million arising from foreign currency transactions 
foreign exchange derivatives at october  were in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter 
there is a concentration of these contract s held with bank of america  na  which maintains an investment grade rating 
we have a risk averse foreign exchange risk management policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flows are fully hedged 
exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives 
we hedge two categories of foreign exchange exposures assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency  which include future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency and certain us functional currency entity balance sheet accounts denominated in local currencies 
these exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity
