the lakehead system  along with the enbridge system  is the main crude oil export route from the wcsb 
wcsb production in excess of western canadian demand moves on existing pipelines into padd ii  the rocky mountain states padd iv  the anacortes area of washington state padd v and the us gulf coast padd iii 
in each of these regions  wcsb crude oil competes with local and imported crude oil 
as local crude oil production declines and refineries demand more imported crude oil  imports from the wcsb should increase 
for  the latest data available shows that padd ii total demand was million bpd while it produced only  bpd and thus imported million bpd 
the data indicate padd ii imported approximately million bpd of crude oil from canada  a majority of which was transported on the lakehead system 
the remaining barrels were imported from padds iii and iv as well as from offshore sources through the us gulf coast 
lakehead system deliveries of canadian crude oil to padd ii were  bpd higher than delivery volumes for total deliveries on our lakehead system averaged million bpd in  meeting approximately percent of minnesota refinery capacity  percent of the refinery capacity in the greater chicago area  and percent of ontario s refinery demand 
considering all of the pipeline systems that transport western canadian crude oil out of canada  the system transported approximately percent of the total western canadian crude oil exports in to the united states 
the remaining production was transported by systems serving the british columbia  padd ii  padd iv and padd v markets 
given the expected increase in crude oil production from the alberta oil sands over the next years  alternative transportation proposals have been presented to crude oil producers 
these proposals and projects range from expansions of existing pipelines that currently transport western canadian crude oil  to new pipelines and extensions of existing pipelines 
these proposals and projects are in various stages of development  with some at the concept stage and others that are proceeding with line fill 
some of these proposals will be in direct competition with our lakehead system 
enbridge has proposed construction of the gateway pipeline with an in service date in the to timeframe  which includes both a condensate import pipeline and a petroleum export pipeline 
the condensate line would transport imported diluent from kitimat  british columbia to the edmonton  alberta area 
the petroleum export line would transport crude oil from the edmonton area to kitimat and would compete with our lakehead system for production from the alberta oil sands 
we and enbridge believe that the southern access project  alberta clipper project  and other initiatives to provide access to new markets in the midwest  mid continent and gulf coast  offer flexible solutions to future transportation requirements of western canadian crude oil producers 
the following provides an overview of other proposals and projects put forth by competing pipeline companies that are not affiliated with enbridge construction of a new  bpd crude oil pipeline from hardisty to wood river  illinois and patoka  with capacity subsequently updated to  bpd with an expansion to cushing 
the project is expected to receive line fill sometime in commercial support has been announced to construct a inch crude oil pipeline extension to the pipeline described above that will begin at hardisty and extend down to cushing and then to nederland  texas 
the extension will add an additional  bpd of capacity with a targeted in service date of the proposed pipeline extension received  bpd of shipper support in the third quarter of an application has been filed with the neb  and a variety of regulatory approvals will be required in the united states and canada before the proposed extension can proceed 

table of contents 
index to financial statements these competing alternatives for delivering western canadian crude oil into the united states and other markets could erode shipper support for further expansion of our lakehead system beyond the alberta clipper project 
they could also affect throughput on and utilization of the system 
however  together the lakehead and enbridge systems offer significant cost savings and flexibility advantages  which are expected to continue to favor the system as the preferred alternative for meeting shipper transportation requirements to the midwest united states and beyond 
the following table sets forth average deliveries per day and barrel miles of our lakehead system for each of the periods presented 
deliveries thousands of bpd united states light crude oil medium and heavy crude oil ngl total united states ontario light crude oil medium and heavy crude oil ngl total ontario total deliveries barrel miles billions per year mid continent system our mid continent system  which we have owned since  is located within the padd ii district and is comprised of our ozark pipeline  our west tulsa pipeline and storage terminals at cushing and el dorado  kansas 
our mid continent system includes over miles of crude oil pipelines and million barrels of crude oil storage capacity 
our ozark pipeline transports crude oil from cushing to wood river where it delivers to conocophillips wood river refinery and interconnects with the woodpat pipeline and the wood river pipeline  each owned by unrelated parties 
our west tulsa pipeline moves crude oil from cushing to tulsa  oklahoma where it delivers to holly corporation s tulsa refinery  formally owned by sinclair oil corporation 
the storage terminals consist of individual storage tanks ranging in size from  to  barrels 
of the million barrels of storage capacity on our mid continent system  the cushing terminal accounts for million barrels 
a portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes  while we contract the remainder of the facilities with various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements 
contract fees include fixed monthly capacity fees as well as utilization fees  which we charge for injecting crude oil into and withdrawing crude oil from the storage facilities 
customers 
our mid continent system operates under month to month transportation arrangements and both long term and short term storage arrangements with its shippers 
during  approximately shippers tendered crude oil for service on our mid continent system 
we consider multiple companies that are controlled by a common entity to be a single shipper for purposes of determining the number of shippers delivering crude oil and liquid petroleum on our mid continent system 
these customers include integrated oil companies  independent oil producers  refiners and marketers 
average deliveries on the system were  bpd for and  bpd for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements supply and demand 
our mid continent system is positioned to capitalize on increasing near term demand for crude oil from west texas and imported crude oil delivered to the us gulf coast  as well as third party storage demand 
in  padd ii imported million bpd from outside of the padd ii region 
the data indicates padd ii imported approximately million bpd of crude oil from canada  a majority of which was transported on our lakehead system 
the remaining barrels of crude oil were imported from padds iii and iv as well as offshore sources 
we expect the gap between local supply and demand for crude oil in padd ii to continue to widen  encouraging imports of crude oil from canada  padd iii and foreign sources 
competition 
our ozark pipeline system currently serves an exclusive corridor between cushing and wood river 
however  refineries connected to wood river have crude supply options available from canada via our lakehead system 
these same refineries also have access to the us gulf coast and foreign crude oil supply through the capline pipeline system  which is an undivided joint interest pipeline that is owned by unrelated parties 
in addition  refineries located east of patoka with access to crude oil through our ozark system  also have access to west texas supply through the west texas gulf mid valley pipeline systems owned by unrelated parties 
our ozark pipeline system could face a significant increase in competition when a competitor s new pipeline from hardisty to patoka commences operation in however  when that situation occurs  we will consider potential alternative uses for our ozark system 
in addition  our ozark pipeline system provides crude oil types and grades that are generally lighter and with lower sulfur relative to that expected to be transported on the new pipeline 
in addition to movements into wood river  crude oil in cushing is transported to chicago and el dorado on third party pipeline systems 
with the reversal of the spearhead pipeline  western canadian crude oil moving on spearhead is increasing the importance of cushing as a terminal and pipeline origination area 
competition to our west tulsa pipeline is by way of unrelated parties shipping portions of a local refinery s supply through a pipeline reactivated in mid this new line was created by modifying existing infrastructure 
the storage terminals rely on demand for storage service from numerous oil market participants 
producers  refiners  marketers and traders rely on storage capacity for a number of different reasons batch scheduling  stream quality control  inventory management  and speculative trading opportunities 
competitors to our storage facilities at cushing include large integrated oil companies and other midstream energy partnerships 
north dakota system our north dakota system is a crude oil gathering and interstate transportation system servicing the williston basin in north dakota and montana  which includes the bakken shale formation 
the crude oil gathering pipelines of our north dakota system collect crude oil from points near producing wells in approximately oil fields in north dakota and montana 
most deliveries from our north dakota system are made at clearbrook to our lakehead system and to a third party pipeline system 
our north dakota system includes approximately miles of crude oil gathering lines connected to a transportation line that is approximately miles long  with a capacity of approximately  bpd 
we recently completed a  bpd increase in capacity resulting from the phase vi expansion of the system  which we completed in december this expansion was necessary to meet increased crude oil production from the montana and north dakota region 
the related tolling surcharge has been adjusted to include costs of this phase of the expansion that became effective january  the commercial structure for this expansion is a cost of service based surcharge that was added to the existing transportation rates 
our north dakota system also has pump stations  one delivery station and storage facilities with an aggregate working storage capacity of approximately  barrels 
customers 
customers of our north dakota system include refiners of crude oil  producers of crude oil and purchasers of crude oil at the wellhead  such as marketers  that require crude oil gathering and transportation services 
producers range in size from small independent owner operators to the largest integrated oil companies 
supply and demand 
similar to our lakehead system  our north dakota system depends upon demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the ability of crude oil producers to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements maintain their crude oil production and exploration activities 
due to increased exploration of the bakken and three forks formations within the williston basin  the state of north dakota has seen increased production levels up to  bpd in november the us portion of the williston basin now produces more than  bpd 
competition 
competitors of our north dakota system include integrated oil companies  interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other crude oil gatherers 
many crude oil producers in the oil fields served by our north dakota system have alternative gathering facilities available to them or have the ability to build their own assets  including some existing rail loading facilities 
natural gas segment we own and operate natural gas gathering  treating  processing and transportation systems as well as trucking  rail and liquids marketing operations 
we purchase and gather natural gas from the wellhead and deliver it to plants for treating and or processing and to intrastate or interstate pipelines for transmission to wholesale customers such as power plants  industrial customers and local distribution companies 
natural gas treating involves the removal of hydrogen sulfide  carbon dioxide  water and other substances from raw natural gas so that it will meet the standards for pipeline transportation 
natural gas processing involves the separation of raw natural gas into residue gas and ngls 
residue gas is the processed natural gas that ultimately is consumed by end users 
ngls separated from the raw natural gas are either sold and transported as ngl raw mix or further separated through a process known as fractionation and sold as their individual components  including ethane  propane  butanes and natural gasoline 
at december   we had nine active treating plants and active processing plants  including three hydrocarbon dewpoint control facilities  or hcdp plants 
we may idle some of these plants from time to time based on current volumes 
our treating facilities have a combined capacity that approximates  mmcf d while the combined capacity of our processing facilities approximates  mmcf d  including mmcf d provided by the hcdp plants 
our natural gas business consists of the following systems east texas system includes approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines  nine natural gas treating plants and seven natural gas processing plants  including three hcdp plants 
anadarko system consists of approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines in southwest oklahoma and the texas panhandle and six natural gas processing plants 
the anadarko system also includes the palo duro system 
north texas system includes approximately  miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and nine natural gas processing plants located in the fort worth basin 
in november  we divested non core natural gas assets located predominantly outside of texas  which included over  miles of pipeline  including interstate and intrastate gas transmission pipelines  and several small gathering and processing assets 
customers 
customers of our natural gas pipeline systems include both purchasers and producers of natural gas 
purchasers are comprised of marketers  including our marketing business  and large users of natural gas  such as power plants  industrial facilities and local distribution companies 
producers served by our systems consist of small  medium and large independent operators and large integrated energy companies 
we sell ngls resulting from our processing activities to a variety of customers ranging from large petrochemical and refining companies to small regional retail propane distributors 
our natural gas pipelines serve customers predominantly in the us gulf coast region of the united states 
customers include large users of natural gas  such as power plants  industrial facilities  local distribution companies  large consumers seeking an alternative to their local distribution company  and shippers of natural gas  such as natural gas producers and marketers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements supply and demand 
demand for our gathering  treating and processing services primarily depends upon the supply of natural gas reserves and the drilling rate for new wells 
the level of impurities in the natural gas gathered also affects treating services 
demand for these services also depends upon overall economic conditions and the prices of natural gas and ngls 
due to the current economic conditions and surplus of natural gas  we expect that near term demand for our services may decrease 
falling drilling rates appear to have stabilized near the end of and in some regions the number of drilling rigs is rising slightly 
the economic crisis combined with a surplus of natural gas supply expected from the lower states has led to lower prices and lower drilling rates 
however  our natural gas assets remain in basins that have the opportunity to grow even in a moderate pricing environment 
all three of our natural gas systems exist in regions that have shale or tight sands formations where horizontal fracturing technology can be utilized to increase production from the natural gas wells 
our east texas system is primarily located in the east texas basin 
the bossier trend  which is located on the western side of our east texas system within the east texas basin  has been the driver of growth on our east texas system for the past several years 
production in the bossier trend grew from under mmcf d in to  mmcf d in march of however  with the drop in natural gas prices  the bossier trend has seen a significant drop in development with production falling to  mmcf d in october  with modest declines experienced in the remainder of the east texas basin 
this decreased drilling activity in the bossier trend is expected to be more than offset by the increased activity focused in and around the haynesville shale 
the haynesville shale is a formation that runs from western louisiana into eastern texas  and has the potential of being the largest natural gas discovery in the united states 
if proven  the discovery could create more drilling activity around our east texas system increasing the demand for our services 
we are undertaking expansions to provide gathering  treating and transportation services to several producers in counties west and south of carthage 
in a further effort to address the continuing strong growth in natural gas production occurring in east texas  we successfully completed expansion and extension of our east texas system  referred to as the clarity project 
the clarity project included the following portions of expansion which were completed throughout and construction of the orange county compressor station was completed and placed into service in late february  the goodrich compressor station was constructed and placed into service in december  a inch segment from orange county  texas to a downstream interconnect near beaumont  texas  enabling deliveries into the interconnect  was placed into service in december  and a inch diameter pipeline segment that extends from kountze  texas to orange county was placed into service in july now that our clarity project has been completed  we are able to provide service to major industrial companies in southeast texas with interconnects to interstate pipelines  intrastate pipelines and wholesale customers 
the clarity project was designed to be expandable and is positioned for potential upstream and downstream extensions to meet the growing demand for natural gas transportation capacity 
in the second quarter of  we completed an expansion project to add compression at the carthage hub and on the shelby county lateral sections of our east texas system 
as part of the expansion project  we also increased the capacity of our east texas system in the area by installing approximately miles of inch pipeline 
the completed expansion provides an additional mmcf d of capacity for this growing region 
a substantial portion of natural gas on our north texas system is produced in the barnett shale area within the fort worth basin conglomerate 
the fort worth basin conglomerate is a mature zone that is experiencing slow production decline 
in contrast  the barnett shale area is one of the most active natural gas plays in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements north america 
while abundant natural gas reserves have been known to exist in the barnett shale area since the early s  technological advances in fracturing the shale formation allows commercial production of these natural gas reserves 
based on the latest information available for  barnett shale production has risen from approximately mmcf d in to approximately  mmcf d by the end of with substantially reduced drilling in the first half of  production volume was down to  mmcf d by october  although the number of drilling rigs began to increase in late we anticipate that throughput on the north texas system will increase modestly in each of the next several years as a result of continued barnett shale development 
the expected increase in throughput is a result of producers balancing the economics of lower commodity prices with the prolific drilling opportunities of the barnett shale 
our anadarko system is located within the anadarko basin and has experienced considerable growth as a result of the rapid development of the granite wash play in hemphill and wheeler counties in texas 
however  with rig counts down by during the first half of  production of natural gas in the region fell 
recently volume has begun to rise slightly 
while rig counts are still well below the peak levels of  a notable difference is that producers are drilling considerably more horizontal wells in the region  and the early results have been promising with high initial production rates 
this development may lead to enhanced recoveries from new and existing wells in this region 
an additional factor regarding the development of the wells in this region is the high natural gas liquids content  which enhances the economics of these wells due to the value of the natural gas liquids 
while capital markets have stabilized and our cost of capital approximates pre financial crisis levels  we will continue to be cautious regarding our capital program 
the expansion programs we are undertaking in east texas to serve the haynesville shale developments are being supported by long term contracts and include demand payments as a significant element of the contractual structure 
other potential expansions may arise as more producers begin actively developing this region and commit for additional capacity 
neither the anadarko nor the north texas systems have any major capital programs planned in the near term 
however  we will continue to pursue connections for new wells as rig counts increase and will monitor developments closely if volumes appear to rise resulting in the need for added capacity 
we will opportunistically evaluate strategic prospects to further expand the service capabilities of our existing system 
results of our natural gas business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas we serve 
we expect that the rate of decline of natural gas production has slowed or halted due to the increase in rig activity 
we expect the volumes on our anadarko system to stay level or possibly rise slightly due to high prices for ngls and the increased use of horizontal drilling in the midcontinent region of the united states 
our east texas and north texas systems are located in two areas where we believe producers are likely to remain active due to the higher probability of success associated with resource developments in these areas 
we believe the higher success rate in these two areas  coupled with the recent natural gas discovery of the haynesville shale  should temper the impact of lower natural gas production that generally results from a reduction in drilling activity 
competition 
competition from other pipeline companies is significant in all the markets we serve 
competitors of our gathering  treating and processing systems include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that gather  treat  process and market natural gas or ngls 
some of these competitors are substantially larger than we are 
competition for the services we provide varies based upon the location of gathering  treating and processing facilities 
most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering  treating and processing facilities available to them 
in addition  they have alternatives such as building their own gathering facilities or  in some cases  selling their natural gas supplies without treating and processing 
in addition to location  competition also varies based upon pricing arrangements and reputation 
on the sour natural gas systems  such as our east texas system  competition is more limited due to the infrastructure required to treat sour natural gas 
competition for customers in the marketing of residue natural gas is based primarily upon the price of the delivered natural gas  the services offered by the seller and the reliability of the seller in making deliveries 
residue natural gas also competes on a price basis with alternative fuels such as crude oil and coal  especially for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements customers that have the capability of using these alternative fuels  and on the basis of local environmental considerations 
competition in the marketing of ngls comes from other ngl marketing companies  producers  traders  chemical companies and other asset owners 
because pipelines are generally the only practical mode of transportation for natural gas over land  the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipelines 
pipelines typically compete with each other based on location  capacity  price and reliability 
many of the large wholesale customers we serve have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities 
accordingly  many of these customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines or third parties that may hold capacity on the various pipelines 
in addition  a number of new interstate natural gas pipelines are being constructed in areas currently served by some of our intrastate pipelines 
when completed  these new pipelines may compete for customers with our existing pipelines 
trucking and liquids marketing operations we also include our trucking and liquids marketing operations in our natural gas segment 
these operations include the transportation of ngls  crude oil and other products by truck and railcar from wellheads and treating  processing and fractionation facilities to wholesale customers  such as distributors  refiners and chemical facilities 
in addition  our trucking and liquids marketing operations resell these products 
a key component of our business is ensuring market access for the liquids extracted at our processing facilities 
on average  this accounts for approximately half of the volumes transported by our trucking and liquids marketing business and is a major source of its growth in this area 
our services are provided using trucks  trailers and rail cars  product treating and handling equipment and ngl storage facilities 
in  we expanded our fleet by acquiring the assets of a common carrier trucking company to meet the growing supply of ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide from our processing facilities  as well as to capitalize on the opportunity to better serve our us gulf coast customers 
this acquisition increased the size of our truck fleet from to trucks and trailers 
customers 
most of the customers of our trucking and liquids marketing operations are wholesale customers  such as refineries and propane distributors 
our trucking and liquids marketing operations also market products to wholesale customers such as petrochemical plants 
supply and demand 
supply is sourced from a variety of areas in the us gulf coast  with a significant amount of the ngl volume coming from our own gathering and processing facilities 
crude oil and natural gas prices and production levels affect the supply of these products 
the demand for our services is affected by the demand for ngls and crude oil by large industrial refineries and similar customers in the regions served by this business 
competition 
our trucking and liquids marketing operations have a number of competitors  including other trucking and railcar operations  pipelines  and  to a lesser extent  marine transportation and alternative fuels 
in addition  the marketing activities of our trucking and liquids marketing operations have numerous competitors  including marketers of all types and sizes  affiliates of pipelines and independent aggregators 
marketing segment our marketing segment s primary objectives are to maximize the value of the natural gas purchased by our gathering systems and the throughput on our gathering and intrastate wholesale customer pipelines and to mitigate financial risk 
to achieve this objective  our marketing segment transacts with various counterparties to provide natural gas supply  transportation  balancing  storage and sales services 
since our gathering and intrastate wholesale customer pipeline assets are geographically located within texas and oklahoma  the majority of activities conducted by our marketing segment are focused within these areas  or points downstream of this location 
customers 
natural gas purchased by our marketing business is sold to industrial  utility and power plant end use customers 
in addition  gas is sold to marketing companies at various market hubs 
these sales are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements typically priced based upon a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to end use customers incorporate a pass through charge for costs of transportation and additional margin to compensate us for associated services 
supply and demand 
supply for our marketing business depends to a large extent on the natural gas reserves and rate of drilling within the areas served by our natural gas business 
demand is typically driven by weather related factors with respect to power plant and utility customers and industrial demand 
our marketing business uses third party storage capacity to balance supply and demand factors within its portfolio 
our marketing business pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
our marketing business leases third party pipeline capacity downstream from our natural gas assets under firm transportation contracts  which capacity is dependent on the volumes of natural gas from our natural gas assets 
this capacity is leased for various lengths of time and at rates that allow our marketing business to diversify its customer base by expanding its service territory 
additionally  this transportation capacity provides assurance that our natural gas will not be shut in  which can result from capacity constraints on downstream pipelines 
competition 
our marketing segment has numerous competitors  including large natural gas marketing companies  marketing affiliates of pipelines  major oil and natural gas producers  independent aggregators and regional marketing companies 
regulation ferc allowance for income taxes in interstate common carrier pipeline rates in december  the ferc released its first case specific review of the income tax allowance issue reaffirming its income tax allowance policy and directing the pipeline under review to provide certain evidence necessary to determine its income tax allowance 
the ferc s bp west coast remand decision and the new tax allowance policy were appealed to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  or the dc circuit court 
in may  the dc circuit court upheld the income tax allowance policy adopted by the ferc for master limited partnerships  or mlps  and other non taxable entities 
on the basis of the santa fe pacific pipeline  lp  or sfpp  order  the lp circuit court concluded that the ferc s new policy statement applied to sfpp and resolved the principal defect of the lakehead policy  which was the inadequately explained differential treatment of the tax liability of the individual and corporate partners 
on that basis  the dc circuit court affirmed the ferc s tax allowance policy as being reasonable and in accordance with the ferc s statutory discretion 
as such  the dc circuit court affirmed that an allowance should be permitted on all partnership interests  or similar legal interest  if the owner of that interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on the public utility income earned though the interest 
we believe that all applicable assets will be entitled to a tax allowance to the extent a pipeline s partners have income tax liability on the income they receive from the pipeline 
in august  the dc circuit court denied a request for rehearing of its may decision  and the decision is now final and cannot be appealed 
ferc return on equity policy for oil pipelines on april   the ferc issued a policy statement regarding the inclusion of mlps in the proxy groups used to determine the return on equity  or roe  for oil pipelines 
composition of proxy groups for determining gas and oil pipeline return on equity  ferc   rehearing denied  ferc  
no petitions for review of the policy statement were filed with the dc circuit court 
the policy statement largely upheld the prior method by which roes were calculated for oil pipelines  explaining that mlps should continue to be included in the roe proxy group for oil pipelines  and that there should be no ceiling on the level of distributions included in the ferc s current discounted cash flow  or dcf  methodology 
the policy statement further indicated that the institutional brokers estimated system  or ibes  
table of contents 
index to financial statements forecasts should remain the basis for the short term growth forecast used in the dcf calculation and there should be no modification to the current respective two thirds and one third weightings of the short and long term growth factors 
the primary change to the prior roe methodology was the policy statement s holding that the gross domestic product  or gdp  forecast used for the long term growth rate should be reduced by percent for all mlps included in the proxy group 
everything else being equal  that change will result in somewhat lower roes for oil pipelines than would have been calculated under the prior roe methodology 
the actual roes to be calculated under the new policy statement  however  are dependent on the companies included in the proxy group and the specific conditions existing at the time the roe is calculated in each case 
accounting for pipeline assessment costs in june  the ferc issued an order in docket ai describing how ferc regulated companies should account for costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the united states department of transportation s office of pipeline safety 
the order took effect on january  under the order  ferc regulated companies are generally required to recognize costs incurred for performing pipeline assessments that are part of a pipeline integrity management program as a maintenance expense in the period in which the costs are incurred 
costs for items such as rehabilitation projects designed to extend the useful life of the system can continue to be capitalized to the extent permitted under the existing rules 
the ferc denied rehearing of its accounting guidance order on september  prior to  we capitalized first time in line inspection programs  based on previous rulings by the ferc 
in january  we began expensing all first time internal inspection costs for all our pipeline systems  whether or not they are subject to the ferc s regulation  on a prospective basis 
we continue to expense secondary internal inspection tests consistent with the previous practice

regulation by the ferc of interstate common carrier liquids pipelines our lakehead  north dakota and ozark systems are our primary interstate common carrier liquids pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act  or ica 
as common carriers in interstate commerce  these pipelines provide service to any shipper who requests transportation services  provided that products tendered for transportation satisfy the conditions and specifications contained in the applicable tariff 
the ica requires us to maintain tariffs on file with the ferc that set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines  as well as the rules and regulations governing these services 
the ica gives the ferc the authority to regulate the rates we can charge for service on interstate common carrier pipelines 
the ica requires  among other things  that such rates be just and reasonable as well as nondiscriminatory 
the ica permits interested parties to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate the rates to determine if they are just and reasonable 
if the ferc finds the new or changed rate unlawful  it is authorized to require the carrier to refund  with interest  the increased revenues in excess of the amount that would have been collected during the term of the investigation at the rate properly determined to be lawful 
the ferc also may investigate  upon complaint or on its own motion  rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively 
upon an appropriate showing  a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint 
in october  congress passed the energy policy act of  or ep act  which deemed petroleum pipeline rates that were in effect for the day period ending on the date of enactment  or that were in effect on the th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint  protest or investigation during the day period  to be just and reasonable under the ica ie  grandfathered 
the ep act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates 
in order to challenge grandfathered rates  a party must show  that it was contractually barred from challenging the rates during the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements relevant day period  that there has been a substantial change after the date of enactment of the ep act in the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services that were the basis for the rate  or that the rate is unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential 
the ferc determined our lakehead system rates are not covered by the grandfathering provisions of the ep act because they were subject to challenge prior to the effective date of the statute 
we believe that the rates for our north dakota and ozark systems should be found to be covered by the grandfathering provisions of the ep act 
the ep act required the ferc to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for petroleum pipelines  and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings 
the ferc responded to this mandate by issuing order no 
adopted an indexing rate methodology for petroleum pipelines 
under these regulations  which became effective january   petroleum pipelines are able to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index 
rate increases made within the ceiling levels may be protested  but such protests must show that the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline s increase in costs 
if the indexing methodology results in a reduced ceiling level that is lower than a pipeline s filed rate  order no 
requires the pipeline to reduce its rate to comply with the lower ceiling  although a pipeline is not required to reduce its rate below the level grandfathered under the ep act 
under order no 
 a pipeline must utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates 
the ferc  however  uses cost of service ratemaking  market based rates  and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach in certain specified circumstances 
under order no 
 the original inflation index adopted by the ferc was equal to the annual change in the producer price index for finished goods  or ppi fg  minus one percentage point 
the index was subject to review every five years 
rates were then subject to an annual adjustment  based upon changes in the ppi fg minus one percentage point  in order to accurately reflect the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry 
in december  as part of the ferc s five year review of the oil pricing index july through june  the ferc concluded that the ppi fg accurately reflected the actual cost changes experienced by the industry 
in february  the ferc issued an order on remand  concluding that for the current five year period  the oil pricing index should be the ppi fg 
in order to calculate the ceiling rate levels  oil pipelines were permitted to use the ppi fg adjustment as though it had been in effect since as of july   the index was equal to ppi fg plus percentage points  resulting in a positive index adjustment of for the period of july  through june  in  the ferc is expected to issue a notice of inquiry regarding the oil pipeline indexing methodology 
the oil pipeline industry  shipper companies and any other interested parties will then have the ability to comment on the existing methodology ppi fg plus and provide feedback as to a newly applicable methodology  which is anticipated to go into effect july  the only change expected is an adjustment to the modifier added to or subtracted from the inflation index 
regulation by the ferc of intrastate natural gas pipelines our texas intrastate pipelines are generally not subject to regulation by the ferc 
however  to the extent our intrastate pipelines transport natural gas in interstate commerce  the rates  terms and conditions of such transportation are subject to ferc jurisdiction under section of the natural gas policy act  or ngpa 
in addition  under ferc regulations we are subject to market manipulation and transparency rules 
our operations are subject to regulation under the texas utilities code and the texas natural resources code  as implemented by the texas railroad commission  or trrc 
generally  the trrc is vested with authority to ensure that rates charged for natural gas sales and transportation services are just and reasonable 
the rates we charge for transportation services are deemed just and reasonable under texas law  unless challenged in a complaint 
we cannot predict whether such a complaint may be filed against us or whether the trrc will change its method of regulating rates 
the texas natural resources code provides that an informal complaint process that is conducted by the texas railroad commission shall apply to any rate issues associated with gathering or transmission systems  thus subjecting the intrastate pipeline activities of enbridge to the jurisdiction of the texas railroad commission via its informal complaint process

index to financial statements on december   the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which proposes to require interstate natural gas pipelines and certain non interstate natural gas pipelines to post capacity  daily scheduled flow information  and daily actual flow information 
on november   the ferc issued order no 
 which requires interstate pipelines to post information concerning daily actual flows of no notice service  commencing january  order no 
also requires non interstate pipelines ie  intrastate pipelines that deliver more than million mmbtu per year to post daily on an internet website and in ferc prescribed formats certain information concerning receipt and delivery point capacity and scheduled volumes 
the final effective date for required compliance with this ferc order  which is pending until the resolution of requests for rehearing  shall be days following the ferc s issuance of a final order resolving such requests for rehearing 
until the ferc issues such final order  the rules remain subject to change 
adoption of this proposal by the ferc will result in additional administrative costs stemming from the additional record keeping and reporting requirements 
in addition  on november   the ferc issued a notice of inquiry  or noi  seeking comment on whether it should impose additional reporting requirements on intrastate pipelines providing service under section of the ngpa  such as several of our east texas systems 
in particular  the ferc seeks comment on whether it should require such pipelines to post the details of their transactions with shippers in a manner more comparable to the requirements applicable to interstate pipelines 
ferc has not yet taken any further action on this noi  and we cannot at this stage predict what  if any  additional reporting requirements may be adopted 
natural gas gathering pipeline regulation section b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga 
we own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction 
however  as noted in intrastate pipeline regulation  above  to the extent our gathering systems buy and sell natural gas  such gatherers  in their capacity as buyers and sellers of natural gas  will be subject to ferc order a 
additionally  if one of our gathering systems were to fall under the definition of major non interstate pipeline  such gatherer would be subject to ferc order no 
 as described in intrastate pipeline regulation above  subject to a court ruling otherwise 
state regulations of gathering facilities typically address the safety and environmental concerns involved in the design  construction  installation  testing and operation of gathering facilities 
in addition  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory requirements are also addressed  however  historically rates have not fallen under the purview of state regulations for gathering facilities 
also  some states have  or are considering providing  greater regulatory scrutiny over the commercial regulation of the natural gas gathering business 
many of the producing states have previously adopted some form of complaint based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access or perceived rate discrimination 
our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to significant and unduly burdensome state or federal regulation of rates and services 
sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids the price at which we sell natural gas currently is not subject to federal or state regulation except for certain systems in texas 
our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability  terms and cost of pipeline transportation 
as noted above  the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry  most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies that remain subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
these initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances 
the stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and to facilitate price transparency in markets for the wholesale sale of physical natural gas 
our sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids currently are not regulated and are made at market prices 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to the ferc s jurisdiction under the ica 

table of contents 
index to financial statements certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could increase the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other marketers of these products 
other regulation the governments of the united states and canada have  by treaty  agreed to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment for the passage of oil and natural gas through the pipelines of one country across the territory of the other 
individual border crossing points require us government permits that may be terminated or amended at the discretion of the us government 
these permits provide that pipelines may be inspected by or subject to orders issued by federal or state government agencies 
tariffs and transportation rate cases lakehead system under published tariffs as of december  including the transportation rate surcharges related to lakehead system expansions for transportation on the lakehead system  the rates for transportation of heavy crude oil from the international border near neche  north dakota  where the lakehead system enters the united states unless otherwise stated  to principal delivery points are set forth below published transportation rate per barrel to clearbrook  minnesota to superior  wisconsin to chicago  illinois area to marysville  michigan area to buffalo  new york area chicago to the international border near marysville the transportation rates as of december  for light and medium crude oil and ngls are lower than the transportation rates set forth in this table to compensate for differences in the costs of shipping different types and grades of liquid hydrocarbons 
the lakehead system periodically adjusts transportation rates as allowed under the ferc s indexing methodology and the tariff agreements described below 
upon completion of the alberta clipper project  we anticipate filing increased rates for transportation to be effective april  base rates the base portion of the transportation rates for our lakehead system are subject to an annual adjustment  which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the ferc  and are determined in compliance with the ferc approved indexing methodology 
sep ii surcharge under the settlement agreement with capp that the ferc approved in and reconfirmed in  lakehead implemented a transportation rate surcharge related to the sep ii project 
this surcharge  which is added to the base transportation rates  is a cost of service based calculation that is trued up annually usually in april for actual costs and throughput from the previous calendar year and is not subject to indexing 
the initial term of the sep ii portion of the settlement agreement was for years  beginning in terrace surcharge under the tariff agreement approved by the ferc in  the lakehead system also implemented a transportation rate surcharge for the terrace expansion program of approximately per barrel for light crude oil from the canadian border to chicago 
on april   pursuant to an agreement between the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements lakehead system and enbridge pipelines inc  the lakehead system s share of the surcharge was increased to per barrel 
this surcharge was in effect until april   when the lakehead system s share of the surcharge changed to per barrel 
the lakehead system s share will remain at this level until  at which time the surcharge will return to per barrel through  when the agreement expires 
in addition to the terrace surcharge  included in the tariff agreement is the terrace schedule c adjustment 
under the tariff agreement  when terrace phase iii facilities are in service and annual actual average pumping exiting clearbrook is less than  cubic meters  or m  per day  an adjustment is made to the terrace surcharge 
in  this adjustment was per barrel  based on annual actual average pumping exiting clearbrook of  m per day  bpd in facilities surcharge in june  the ferc approved an offer of settlement in docket no 
or between the lakehead system and capp  for a facilities surcharge framework to be implemented separately from and incrementally to the then existing surcharges in its tariff rates facilities surcharge 
enbridge energy  limited partnership  ferc  
the facilities surcharge framework was intended to be utilized to include additional projects negotiated and agreed upon between the lakehead system and capp as a transparent  cost of service based tariff mechanism 
this allows the lakehead system to recover the costs associated with particular shipper requested projects through an incremental surcharge layered on top of the existing base rates and other commission approved surcharges already in effect 
the facilities surcharge mechanism fsm settlement requires the lakehead system to adjust the facilities surcharge annually to reflect the latest estimates for the upcoming year and to true up the difference between estimates and actual cost and throughput data in the prior year 
the commission permitted the facilities surcharge to take effect as of july  and the facilities surcharge framework was expressly designed to be open ended 
in its approval of the fsm settlement  the commission accepted the lakehead system s proposal to submit for commission review and approval future agreements resulting from negotiations with capp where the parties have agreed that recovery of costs through the facilities surcharge is desirable and appropriate 
at the time the facilities surcharge was initially established  four projects were included in the surcharge the superior manifold modification project  the griffith hartsdale transfer lines project  the hartsdale tanks project  and the line toledo expansion project 
there were four facilities added to the fsm on february  docket no 
or project southern access expansion project  project tank at superior terminal and tank at griffith terminal  project clearbrook manifold  and project tank at superior terminal and tank at griffith terminal 
these projects were incorporated into the facilities surcharge 
on august   the ferc approved an amendment to the fsm settlement to allow the lakehead system to include in the facilities surcharge particular shipper requested projects that are not yet in service as of april st of each year  provided there is an annual true up of throughput and cost estimates 
enbridge energy  limited partnership  ferc  
on february th   the lakehead system filed ferc tariff no 
to update the sep ii  terrace and facilities surcharges and to reflect the inclusion of three new projects that were supported by capp

specifically  the system originates in cushing and offers transportation service to wood river  west tulsa  other mid continent system facilities  local area refineries and other interconnected non affiliated pipelines 
transportation rates for light crude oil from cushing to principle delivery points are set forth below published transportation rate per barrel to wood river  illinois to west tulsa  oklahoma the transportation rates as of december   outlined above  apply to light crude only 
medium and heavy crude oil transportation rates on these systems are higher to compensate for differences in the costs of shipping different types and grades of liquid hydrocarbons 
in addition to the routes above  the mid continent system also has a joint tariff with plains pipeline  lp  which allows for transportation from points in texas and new mexico to wood river

the added costs imposed by regulations are generally no different than those imposed on our competitors 
the failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties and or enforcement actions and added operational costs 
pipeline safety and transportation regulation our transmission and non rural gathering pipelines are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation  or dot  pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration  or phmsa  under title of the united states code of federal regulations pipeline safety act  or psa relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of transmission and non rural gathering pipeline facilities 
phmsa is the agency charged with regulating the safe transportation of hazardous materials under all modes of transportation  including intrastate pipelines 
periodically the psa has been 
table of contents 
index to financial statements reauthorized and amended  imposing new mandates on the regulator to promulgate new regulations and imposing direct mandates on operators of pipelines 
in phmsa published a final rule regarding the qualification of pipeline operations personnel 
the operator qualification regulations require pipeline operators to utilize qualified individuals to perform pipeline operations and maintenance activities or tasks 
the rule required pipeline operators to have a written plan in place by april  and to complete qualification of personnel by october  we have prepared an operator qualification plan which is in compliance with the final rule 
the implementation of this plan does not have a material effect on the operations of our pipelines 
on december   the pipeline safety improvement psi act of was enacted reauthorizing and amending the psa 
the most significant amendment required natural gas pipelines to develop integrity management programs and conduct integrity assessment tests at a minimum of seven year intervals 
such tests can include internal inspection  hydrostatic pressure tests or direct assessments on pipelines in certain high consequence areas 
phmsa has since promulgated rules for this and other mandates included in the psi act of on december   the pipeline inspection  protection  enforcement  and safety act of  referred to as pipes of  was enacted  which further amended the pipeline safety act 
many of the provisions were welcome  including strengthening excavation damage prevention and enforcement 
the most significant provisions of pipes of that will affect us  include a mandate to phmsa to remove most exemptions from federal regulations for liquid pipelines operating at low stress and mandates phmsa to undertake rulemaking requiring pipeline operators to have a human factors management plan for pipeline control room personnel  including consideration for controlling hours of service 
on december  the final rule for the control room management human factors was published 
we have incorporated the new requirements of the and psa amendments into procedures and budgets and  while we expect to incur higher regulatory compliance costs  the increase is not expected to be material 
when hydrocarbons are released into the environment  the phmsa can impose a return to service plan  which can include implementing certain internal inspections  pipeline pressure reductions  and other strategies to verify the integrity of the pipeline in the affected area 
we do not anticipate any return to service plans that will have a material impact on system throughput or compliance costs  however  we have the potential of incurring expenditures to remediate any condition in the event of a discharge or failure on our systems 
our trucking and railcar operations are also subject to safety and permitting regulation by the dot and state agencies with regard to the safe transportation of hazardous and other materials 
we believe that our pipeline  trucking and railcar operations are in substantial compliance with applicable operational and safety requirements 
in instances of non compliance  we have taken actions to remediate the situations 
nevertheless  significant expenses could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the capabilities of our current pipeline control system or other safety equipment 
environmental regulation general 
our operations are subject to complex federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment  including laws and regulations which govern the handling  storage and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials or emissions from natural gas compression facilities 
as with the pipeline and processing industry in general  complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain  and upgrade equipment and facilities 
while these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income  we believe that they do not affect our competitive position since the operations of our competitors are generally similarly affected 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition to compliance costs  violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal fines and penalties and  in some instances  injunctions banning or delaying certain activities 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
there are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations  such as leaks or spills of crude oil  liquids or natural gas or other substances from our pipelines or storage facilities 
such accidental releases could  to the extent not insured  subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage  and fines  penalties  or damages for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
although we are entitled  in certain circumstances  to indemnification from third parties for environmental liabilities relating to assets we acquired from those parties  these contractual indemnification rights are limited and  accordingly  we may be required to bear substantial environmental expenses 
however  we believe that through our due diligence process  we identify and manage substantial issues 
air and water emissions 
our operations are subject to the federal clean air act  or caa  and the federal clean water act  or cwa  and comparable state and local statutes 
we anticipate  therefore  that we will incur costs in the next several years for air pollution control equipment and spill prevention measures in connection with maintaining existing facilities and obtaining permits and approvals for any new or acquired facilities 
in  the environmental protection agency  or epa  published the greenhouse gas recordkeeping and reporting rule  which requires applicable facilities to record and report greenhouse gas emissions beginning january  while the operations of our pipelines are subject to the rule  we do not believe that the rule requirements will have a material effect on our operations 
the oil pollution act  or opa  was enacted in and amends parts of the cwa and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to oil spills 
under the opa  we could be subject to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill from our facilities into navigable waters  along shorelines or in an exclusive economic zone of the united states 
the opa also imposes certain spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements for many of our non pipeline facilities  such as the preparation of detailed oil spill emergency response plans and the construction of dikes or other containment structures to prevent contamination of navigable or other waters in the event of an oil overflow  rupture or leak 
for our liquid pipeline facilities  the opa imposes requirements for emergency plans to be prepared  submitted and approved by the dot 
for our non transportation facilities  such as storage tanks that are not integral to pipeline transportation system  the opa regulations are promulgated by the epa 
we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations 
hazardous substances and waste management 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla also known as the superfund law  and similar state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons  including the owners or operators of waste disposal sites and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
we may generate some wastes that fall within the definition of a hazardous substance 
we may  therefore  be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of any costs required to clean up and restore sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
analogous state laws may apply to a broader range of substances than cercla and  in some instances  may offer fewer exemptions from liability 
we have not received any notification that we may be potentially responsible for material cleanup costs under cercla or similar state laws 
employee health and safety 
the workplaces associated with our operations are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health administration  or osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate worker health and safety 
we have an ongoing safety  procedure and training program for our employees and believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable osha requirements  including

index to financial statements industry consensus standards  record keeping requirements  monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances  and hazard communication standards 
site remediation 
we own and operate a number of pipelines  gathering systems  storage facilities and processing facilities that have been used to transport  distribute  store and process crude oil  natural gas and other petroleum products 
many of our facilities were previously owned and operated by third parties whose handling  disposal and release of petroleum and waste materials were not under our control 
the age of the facilities  combined with the past operating and waste disposal practices  which were standard for the industry and regulatory regime at the time  have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some facilities due to historical spills and releases 
such contamination is not unusual within the natural gas and petroleum industry 
historical contamination found on  under or originating from our properties may be subject to cercla  resource conservation recovery act and analogous state laws as described above 
under these laws  we could incur substantial expense to remediate such contamination  including contamination caused by prior owners and operators 
in addition  enbridge management  as the entity with managerial responsibility for us  could also be liable for such costs to the extent that we are unable to fulfill our obligations 
we have conducted site investigations at some of our facilities to assess historical environmental issues  and we are currently addressing soil and groundwater contamination at various facilities through remediation and monitoring programs  with oversight by the applicable governmental agencies where appropriate 
employees neither we nor enbridge management have any employees 
our general partner has delegated to enbridge management  pursuant to a delegation of control agreement  substantially all of the responsibility for our day to day management and operation 
our general partner  however  retains certain functions and approval rights over our operations 
to fulfill its management obligations  enbridge management has entered into agreements with enbridge and several of its affiliates to provide enbridge management with the necessary services and support personnel who act on enbridge management s behalf as its agents 
we are ultimately responsible for reimbursing these service providers based on the costs that they incur in performing these services 
insurance our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the liquid petroleum and natural gas gathering  treating  processing and transportation industry 
we maintain insurance coverage for our operations and properties considered to be customary in the industry 
the coverage limits and deductible amounts at december  for our insurance policies denominated in cad and united states dollars usd were as follows coverage limits deductible amount insurance type cad usd cad usd in millions in millions property and business interruption up to up to general liability up to up to pollution liability up to up to based on an exchange rate at december  of cad to usd when coverage was renewed 
we can make no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain will be available or adequate for any particular risk or loss or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
although we believe that our assets are adequately covered by insurance  a substantial uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

risk factors we encourage you to read the risk factors below in connection with the other sections of this annual report on form k 
risks related to our business our actual construction and development costs could exceed our forecast and our cash flow from construction and development projects may not be immediate  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase cash distributions 
our strategy contemplates significant expenditures for the development  construction or other acquisition of energy infrastructure assets 
the construction of new assets involves numerous regulatory  environmental  legal  political  materials and labor cost and operational risks that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
as a result  we may not be able to complete our projects at the costs currently estimated or within the time periods we have projected 
if we experience material cost overruns  we will have to finance these overruns using one or more of the following methods using cash from operations  delaying other planned projects  incurring additional indebtedness  or issuing additional equity 
any or all of these methods may not be available when needed or may adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 
our revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately on our expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for example  if we build a new pipeline or expand an existing facility  the design  construction  development and installation may occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increase in revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service and customers begin using the systems 
if our revenues and cash flow do not increase at projected levels because of substantial unanticipated delays or other factors  we may not meet our obligations as they become due and we may need to reduce or reprioritize our capital budget  sell non strategic assets  access the capital markets or reassess our level of distributions to unitholders to meet our capital requirements 
our ability to access capital markets and credit on attractive terms to obtain funding for our capital projects and acquisitions may be limited 
our ability to fund our capital projects and make acquisitions depends on whether we can access the necessary financing to fund these activities 
domestic and international economic conditions affect the functioning of capital markets and the availability of credit 
adverse economic conditions  such as those prevalent during the recessionary period of and  periodically result in weakness and volatility in the capital markets  which in turn can limit  temporarily or for extended periods  our ability to raise capital through equity or debt offerings 
additionally  the availability and cost of obtaining credit commitments from lenders can change as economic conditions and banking regulations reduce the credit that lenders have available or are willing to lend 
these conditions  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector and the re pricing of market risks  can make it difficult to obtain funding for our capital needs from the capital markets on acceptable economic terms 
as a result  we may revise the timing and scope of these projects as necessary to adapt to prevailing market and economic conditions 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding for our capital needs will be available from bank credit arrangements or capital markets on acceptable terms  if needed and to the extent required 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to implement our development plan  enhance our existing business  complete acquisitions and construction projects  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations

standard poor s s p  dominion bond rating service dbrs and moody s investors service moody s rate our non credit enhanced  senior unsecured debt at bbb with a stable outlook  bbb with a stable outlook and baa with a stable outlook  respectively 
although we are not aware of any current plans by the ratings agencies to lower their respective ratings on such debt  we cannot be assured that such credit ratings will not be downgraded 
currently  we are parties to certain international swap and derivative association  inc  or isda  agreements associated with the derivative financial instruments we use to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices 
these isda agreements require us to provide assurances of performance if our counterparties exposure to us exceeds certain levels or thresholds 
we generally provide letters of credit to satisfy such requirements 
at december   we have provided million in the form of letters of credit as assurances of performance for our then outstanding derivative financial instruments 
if our credit ratings had declined to bbb for s p or baa for moody s  at december   we would have been required to provide letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million to satisfy this requirement of our isda agreements 
the amount of any letters of credit we would have to establish under the terms of our isda agreements would reduce the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facility 
we may not have sufficient cash flows to enable us to continue to pay distributions at the current level 
we may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to enable us to pay distributions at the current level 
the amount of cash we are able to distribute depends on the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which can fluctuate quarterly based upon a number of factors  including the level of capital expenditures we make  the amount of cash reserves established by enbridge management  our ability to access capital markets and borrow money  our debt service requirements and restrictions in our credit agreements  fluctuations in our working capital needs  and the cost of acquisitions 
in addition  the amount of cash we distribute depends primarily on our cash flow rather than net income or net loss 
therefore  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record net losses or may make no distributions during periods when we record net income 
our acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful if we incorrectly predict operating results  are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and integrate acquired assets or businesses or are unable to raise financing on acceptable terms 
the acquisition of complementary energy delivery assets is a component of our strategy 
acquisitions present various risks and challenges  including the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of the acquired operations or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring such operations  a decrease in liquidity as a result of utilizing significant amounts of available cash or borrowing capacity to finance an acquisition  the loss of critical customers or employees at the acquired business  the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not fully and adequately indemnified  the risk of failing to effectively integrate the operations or management of acquired assets or businesses or a significant delay in such integration  and diversion of management s attention from existing operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  we may be unable to identify acquisition targets and consummate acquisitions in the future or be unable to raise  on terms we find acceptable  any debt or equity financing that may be required for any such acquisition 
our financial performance could be adversely affected if our pipeline systems are used less 
our financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes transported on our liquids or natural gas pipeline systems 
decreases in the volumes transported by our systems can directly and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the volume transported on our pipelines can be influenced by factors beyond our control including competition  regulatory action  weather conditions  storage levels  alternative energy sources  decreased demand  fluctuations in energy commodity prices  economic conditions  supply disruptions  availability of supply connected to our pipeline systems  and availability and adequacy of infrastructure to move supply into and out of our systems 
as an example  the volume of shipments on our lakehead system depends heavily on the supplies of western canadian crude oil 
insufficient supplies of western canadian crude oil will adversely affect our business by limiting shipments on our lakehead system 
decreases in conventional crude oil exploration and production activities in western canada and other factors  including supply disruption  higher development costs and competition  can slow the rate of growth of our lakehead system 
the volume of crude oil that we transport on our lakehead system also depends on the demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the volumes of crude oil and refined products delivered by others into these regions and the province of ontario 
pipeline capacity for the delivery of crude oil to the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states currently exceeds refining capacity 
in addition  our ability to increase deliveries to expand our lakehead system in the future depends on increased supplies of western canadian crude oil 
we expect that growth in future supplies of western canadian crude oil will come from oil sands projects in alberta 
full utilization of additional capacity as a result of the current and future expansions of our lakehead system  including the alberta clipper and southern access projects  will largely depend on these anticipated increases in crude oil production from oil sands projects 
a reduction in demand for crude oil or a decline in crude oil prices may make certain oil sands projects uneconomical since development costs for production of crude oil from oil sands is greater than development costs for production of conventional crude oil 
oil sands producers may cancel or delay plans to expand their facilities  as some oil sands producers have already done  if crude oil prices remain at levels that do not support expansion 
additionally  measures adopted by the government of the province of alberta to increase its share of revenues from oil sands development coupled with a decline in crude oil prices could reduce the volume growth we have anticipated in executing our construction projects to increase the capacity of our crude oil pipelines 
the volume of shipments on natural gas and ngl systems depends on the supply of natural gas and ngls available for shipment from the producing regions that supply these systems 
supply available for shipment can be affected by many factors  including commodity prices  weather and drilling activity among other factors listed above 
volumes shipped on these systems are also affected by the demand for natural gas and ngls in the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements markets these systems serve 
existing customers may not extend their contracts for a variety of reasons  including a decline in the availability of natural gas from our mid continent  us gulf coast and east texas producing regions  or if the cost of transporting natural gas from other producing regions through other pipelines into the markets served by the natural gas systems were to render the delivered cost of natural gas on our systems uneconomical 
we may be unable to find additional customers to replace the lost demand or transportation fees 
competition may reduce our revenues 
our lakehead system faces current  and potentially further competition for transporting western canadian crude oil from other pipelines  which may reduce our volumes and the associated revenues 
for our cost of service arrangements  these lower volumes will increase our transportation rates 
the increase in transportation rates could result in rates that are higher than competitive conditions will otherwise permit 
our lakehead system competes with other crude oil and refined product pipelines and other methods of delivering crude oil and refined products to the refining centers of minneapolis st 
paul  minnesota  chicago  detroit  michigan  toledo  buffalo  new york  and sarnia and the refinery market and pipeline hub located in the patoka wood river area of southern illinois 
refineries in the markets served by our lakehead system compete with refineries in western canada  the province of ontario and the rocky mountain region of the united states for supplies of western canadian crude oil 
our ozark pipeline system will face a significant increase in competition when a new pipeline from hardisty to patoka is completed in we also encounter competition in our natural gas gathering  treating  processing and transmission businesses 
a number of new interstate natural gas transmission pipelines being constructed could reduce the revenue we derive from the intrastate transmission of natural gas 
many of the large wholesale customers served by our natural gas systems have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities 
thus  many of these wholesale customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines and or from third parties that may hold capacity on other pipelines 
most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering and processing facilities available to them 
in addition  they have other alternatives  such as building their own gathering facilities or  in some cases  selling their natural gas supplies without processing 
some of our natural gas marketing competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger supplies of natural gas than those available to us  which could allow those competitors to price their services more aggressively than we do 
our gas marketing operations involve market and regulatory risks 
as part of our natural gas marketing activities  we purchase natural gas at prices determined by prevailing market conditions 
following our purchase of natural gas  we generally resell natural gas at a higher price under a sales contract that is generally comparable in terms to our purchase contract  including any price escalation provisions 
the profitability of our natural gas operations may be affected by the following factors our ability to negotiate on a timely basis natural gas purchase and sales agreements in changing markets  reluctance of wholesale customers to enter into long term purchase contracts  consumers willingness to use other fuels when natural gas prices increase significantly  timing of imbalance or volume discrepancy corrections and their impact on financial results  the ability of our customers to make timely payment  inability to match purchase and sale of natural gas on comparable terms  and changes in  limitations upon or elimination of the regulatory authorization required for our wholesale sales of natural gas in interstate commerce 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility and risks associated with our hedging activities 
the prices of natural gas  ngls and crude oil are inherently volatile  and we expect this volatility will continue 
we buy and sell natural gas and ngls in connection with our marketing activities 
our exposure to commodity price volatility is inherent to our natural gas and ngl purchase and resale activities  in addition to our natural gas processing activities 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to reduce our commodity price exposure  we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the level of the hedges 
however  because we are not fully hedged  we will continue to have commodity price exposure on the unhedged portion of the fees we derive from the commodities we receive in kind as payment for our gathering  processing  treating and transportation services 
we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices on to percent of the natural gas  ngls and condensate we expect to receive in the near term 
as a result of this unhedged exposure  a substantial decline in the prices of these commodities could adversely affect our financial performance 
additionally  our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows 
our hedging activities can result in substantial losses if hedging arrangements are imperfect or ineffective and our hedging policies and procedures are not followed properly or do not work as intended 
further  hedging contracts are subject to the credit risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the contracts  particularly during periods of weak and volatile economic conditions 
in addition  certain of the financial instruments we use to hedge our commodity risk exposures must be accounted for on a mark to market basis 
this causes periodic earnings volatility due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
changes in  or challenges to  our rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the rates charged by several of our pipeline systems are regulated by the ferc or state regulatory agencies or both 
if one of these regulatory agencies  on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties  were to lower our tariff rates  the profitability of our pipeline businesses would suffer 
if we were permitted to raise our tariff rates for a particular pipeline  there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect  which delay could further reduce our cash flow 
furthermore  competition from other pipeline systems may prevent us from raising our tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit us to do so 
the regulatory agencies that regulate our systems periodically implement new rules  regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction 
new initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for our services 
we believe that the rates we charge for transportation services on our interstate common carrier oil and open access natural gas pipelines are just and reasonable under the ica and nga  respectively 
however  because the rates that we charge are subject to review upon an appropriately supported protest or complaint  or a regulator s own initiative  we cannot predict what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future for service on our interstate common carrier oil and open access natural gas pipelines 
furthermore  because rates charged for transportation services must be competitive with those charged by other transporters  the rates set forth in our tariffs will be determined based on competitive factors in addition to regulatory considerations 
increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny may reduce our revenues 
our interstate pipelines and certain activities of our intrastate natural gas pipelines are subject to ferc regulation of terms and conditions of service 
in the case of interstate natural gas pipelines  ferc also establishes requirements respecting the construction and abandonment of pipeline facilities 
ferc has pending proposals to increase posting and other compliance requirements applicable to natural gas markets 
such changes could prompt an increase in ferc regulatory oversight of our pipelines and additional legislation that could increase our ferc regulatory compliance costs and decrease the net income generated by our pipeline systems 

table of contents 
index to financial statements compliance with environmental and operational safety regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities 
our pipeline  gathering  processing and trucking operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational and worker safety 
numerous governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with the laws and regulations they administer and permits they issue  oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions 
our failure to comply with these laws  regulations and operating permits can result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations 
our operation of liquid petroleum and natural gas gathering  processing  treating and transportation facilities exposes us to the risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities 
additionally  operational modifications necessary to comply with regulatory requirements and resulting from our handling of liquid petroleum and natural gas  historical environmental contamination  accidental releases or upsets  regulatory enforcement  litigation or safety and health incidents can also result in significant cost 
we may incur joint and several strict liability under these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of liquid petroleum and natural gas and wastes on  under or from our properties and facilities  many of which have been used for gathering or processing activities for a number of years  oftentimes by third parties not under our control 
private parties  including the owners of properties through which our gathering systems pass and facilities where our liquid petroleum and natural gas or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal  may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage 
we may also incur costs in the future due to changes in environmental and safety laws and regulations  or re interpretations of enforcement policies or claims for personal  property or environmental damage 
we may not be able to recover these costs from insurance or through higher rates 
our operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 
in june of  the us house of representatives passed a cap and trade bill known as the american clean energy and security act of  which is now being considered by the us senate 
in addition  more than one third of the states already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
further  on april   the united states supreme court in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
in july  the epa released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act and other potential methods of regulating greenhouse gases 
on april   epa responded to the massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa decision with a proposed finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations  and that certain greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change 
moreover  on september   epa finalized a rule requiring nation wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions beginning january  the rule applies primarily to large facilities emitting  metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year  and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gas  as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and engines 
finally  on september   epa proposed a rule that would  in general  require facilities that emit more than  tons per year of greenhouse gas equivalents to obtain permits to demonstrate that best practices and technology are being used to minimize greenhouse gas emissions 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
canada is one of many foreign nations participating in the kyoto protocol  a treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
the treaty requires canada to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below levels by while the united states is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol  its congress has been actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the development of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows  in addition to the demand for our services 
pipeline operations involve numerous risks that may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
operation of complex pipeline systems  gathering  treating  processing and trucking operations involves many risks  hazards and uncertainties 
these events include adverse weather conditions  accidents  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  the performance of the facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions  fires  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  landslides or other similar events beyond our control 
these types of catastrophic events could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution and impairment of our operations  any of which could also result in substantial losses for which we may bear a part or all of the cost 
for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas  including residential communities  commercial business centers  industrial sites and other public gathering locations  the level of damage resulting from these catastrophic events could be greater 
measurement adjustments on our pipeline system can be materially impacted by changes in estimation  commodity prices and other factors 
oil measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operations associated with our liquid petroleum pipelines 
the three types of oil measurement adjustments that routinely occur on our systems include physical  which results from evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement including sediment and water measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents  degradation  which result from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation  which are a function of crude oil prices  the level of our carriers inventory and the inventory positions of customers 
quantifying oil measurement adjustments is inherently difficult because physical measurements of volumes are not practical as products continuously move through our pipelines and virtually all of our pipeline systems are located underground 
in our case  measuring and quantifying oil measurement losses is especially difficult because of the length of our pipeline systems and the number of different grades of crude oil and types of crude oil products we transport 
accordingly  we utilize engineering based models and operational assumptions to estimate product volumes in our system and associated oil measurement losses 
natural gas measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines 
the quantification and resolution of measurement adjustments is complicated by several factors including the significant quantities ie  thousands of measurement meters that we use throughout our natural gas systems  primarily around our gathering and processing assets  varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems  and variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies 
each of these factors may contribute to measurement adjustments that can occur on our natural gas systems 
we are exposed to credit risks of our customers  and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations 
some of our customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness 
severe financial problems encountered by our customers could limit our ability to collect amounts owed to us  or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements 
in addition  many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity 
the combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices  a reduction in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements borrowing bases under reserve based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of our customers liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to us 
furthermore  some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks  which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us 
financial problems experienced by our customers could result in the impairment of our assets  reduction of our operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services  which could reduce our revenues 
risks arising from our partnership structure and relationships with our general partner and enbridge management the interests of enbridge may differ from our interests and the interests of our security holders  and the board of directors of enbridge management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict  not just the interests of our security holders  in making important business decisions 
enbridge indirectly owns all of the shares of our general partner and all of the voting shares of enbridge management  and elects all of the directors of both companies 
furthermore  some of the directors and officers of our general partners and enbridge management are also directors and officers of enbridge 
consequently  conflicts of interest could arise between our unitholders and enbridge 
our partnership agreement limits the fiduciary duties of our general partner to our unitholders 
these restrictions allow our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest by considering the interests of all of the parties to the conflict  including enbridge management s interests  our interests and those of our general partner 
in addition  these limitations reduce the rights of our unitholders under our partnership agreement to sue our general partner or enbridge management  its delegate  should its directors or officers act in a way that  were it not for these limitations of liability  would constitute breaches of their fiduciary duties 
we do not have any employees 
in managing our business and affairs  we rely on employees of enbridge  and its affiliates  who act on behalf of and as agents for us 
a decrease in the availability of employees from enbridge could adversely affect us 
our partnership agreement and the delegation of control agreement limit the fiduciary duties that enbridge management and our general partner owe to our unitholders and restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by enbridge management and our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty 
our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that our general partner would otherwise owe to our unitholders under state fiduciary duty law 
through the delegation of control agreement  these modified fiduciary duties also apply to enbridge management as the delegate of our general partner 
for example  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions  including the determination of which factors it will consider in resolving conflicts of interest  in its sole discretion 
this entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires  and it has no duty or obligation to give consideration to any interest of  or factors affecting  us  our affiliates or any unitholder  provides that any standard of care and duty imposed on our general partner will be modified  waived or limited as required to permit our general partner to act under our partnership agreement and to make any decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in our partnership agreement  so long as such action is reasonably believed by the general partner to be in our best interests  and provides that our general partner and its directors and officers will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our unitholders for any acts or omissions if they acted in good faith 
these and similar provisions in our partnership agreement may restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by enbridge management or our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty 

table of contents 
index to financial statements potential conflicts of interest may arise among enbridge and its shareholders  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
because the fiduciary duties of the directors of our general partner and enbridge management have been modified  the directors may be permitted to make decisions that benefit enbridge and its shareholders or enbridge management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders 
conflicts of interest may arise from time to time among enbridge and its shareholders  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
conflicts of interest may also arise from time to time between us and our unitholders  on the one hand  and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
in managing and controlling us as the delegate of our general partner  enbridge management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict and may resolve those conflicts by making decisions that benefit enbridge and its shareholders or enbridge management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders 
the following decisions  among others  could involve conflicts of interest whether we or enbridge will pursue certain acquisitions or other business opportunities  whether we will issue additional units or other equity securities or whether we will purchase outstanding units  whether enbridge management will issue additional shares  the amount of payments to enbridge and its affiliates for any services rendered for our benefit  the amount of costs that are reimbursable to enbridge management or enbridge and its affiliates by us  the enforcement of obligations owed to us by enbridge management  our general partner or enbridge  including obligations regarding competition between enbridge and us  and the retention of separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for us and enbridge management 
in these and similar situations  any decision by enbridge management may benefit one group more than another  and in making such decisions  enbridge management may consider the interests of all groups  as well as other factors  in deciding whether to take a particular course of action 
in other situations  enbridge may take certain actions  including engaging in businesses that compete with us  that are adverse to us and our unitholders 
for example  although enbridge and its subsidiaries are generally restricted from engaging in any business that is in direct material competition with our businesses  that restriction is subject to the following significant exceptions enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from continuing to engage in businesses  including the normal development of such businesses  in which they were engaged at the time of our initial public offering in december  such restriction is limited geographically only to those routes and products for which we provided transportation at the time of our initial public offering  enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us as part of a larger acquisition  so long as the majority of the value of the business or assets acquired  in enbridge s reasonable judgment  is not attributable to the competitive business  and enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us if that business is first offered for acquisition to us and the board of directors of enbridge management and our unitholders determine not to pursue the acquisition 
since we were not engaged in any aspect of the natural gas business at the time of our initial public offering  enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from competing with us in any aspect of the natural gas business 
in addition  enbridge and its subsidiaries would be permitted to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum over routes that are not the same as our lakehead system  even if such transportation is in direct material competition with our business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements these exceptions also expressly permitted the reversal by enbridge in of one of its pipelines that extends from sarnia to montreal  quebec 
as a result of this reversal  enbridge competes with us to supply crude oil to the ontario market 
we can issue additional common or other classes of units  including additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares  which would dilute your ownership interest 
the issuance of additional common or other classes of units by us  including the issuance of additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares may have the following effects the amount available for distributions on each unit may decrease  the relative voting power of each previously outstanding unit may decrease  and the market price of the class a common units may decline 
additionally  the public sale by our general partner of a significant portion of the class a or class b common units that it currently owns could reduce the market price of the class a common units 
our partnership agreement allows the general partner to cause us to register for public sale any units held by the general partner or its affiliates 
a public or private sale of the class a or class b common units currently held by our general partner could absorb some of the trading market demand for the outstanding class a common units 
holders of our limited partner interests have limited voting rights 
our unitholders have limited voting rights on matters affecting our business  which may have a negative effect on the price at which our common units trade 
in particular  the unitholders did not elect our general partner or the directors of our general partner or enbridge management and have no rights to elect our general partner or the directors of our general partner or enbridge management on an annual or other continuing basis 
furthermore  if unitholders are not satisfied with the performance of our general partner  they may find it difficult to remove our general partner 
under the provisions of our partnership agreement  our general partner may be removed upon the vote of at least of the outstanding common units excluding the units held by the general partner and its affiliates and a majority of the outstanding i units voting together as a separate class excluding the number of i units corresponding to the number of shares of enbridge management held by our general partner and its affiliates 
such removal must  however  provide for the election and succession of a new general partner  who may be required to purchase the departing general partner interest in us in order to become the successor general partner 
such restrictions may limit the flexibility of the limited partners in removing our general partner  and removal may also result in the general partner interest in us held by the departing general partner being converted into class a common units 
we are a holding company and depend entirely on our operating subsidiaries distributions to service our debt obligations 
we are a holding company with no material operations 
if we cannot receive cash distributions from our operating subsidiaries  we will not be able to meet our debt service obligations 
our operating subsidiaries may from time to time incur additional indebtedness under agreements that contain restrictions  which could further limit each operating subsidiary s ability to make distributions to us 
the debt securities we issue and any guarantees issued by any of our subsidiaries that are guarantors will be structurally subordinated to the claims of the creditors of any of our operating subsidiaries who are not guarantors of the debt securities 
holders of the debt securities will not be creditors of our operating subsidiaries who have not guaranteed the debt securities 
the claims to the assets of these non guarantor operating subsidiaries derive from our own ownership interest in those operating subsidiaries 
claims of our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors will generally have priority as to the assets of such operating subsidiaries over our own ownership interest claims and will therefore have priority over the holders of our debt  including the debt securities 
our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors may include general creditors  trade creditors

enbridge management s discretion in establishing our cash reserves gives it the ability to reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
enbridge management may establish cash reserves for us that in its reasonable discretion are necessary to fund our future operating and capital expenditures  provide for the proper conduct of business  and comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners 
these cash reserves affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our holders of common units 
risks related to our debt and our ability to make distributions agreements relating to our debt restrict our ability to make distributions  which could adversely affect the value of our class a common units  and our ability to incur additional debt and otherwise maintain financial and operating flexibility 
our most significant operating subsidiary is restricted by its first mortgage notes from making distributions to us  other than in additional partnership interests in it  unless the distribution is in cash  the distribution amount does not exceed the current available cash of that subsidiary  a default does not exist under the first mortgage notes immediately after giving effect to the distribution and timely notice of the distribution has been given to the holders of the first mortgage notes 
in addition  we are prohibited from making distributions to our unitholders during the existence of certain defaults under our credit facility or during a period in which we have elected to defer interest payments on the junior notes  subject to limited exceptions as set forth in the related indenture 
further  the agreements governing our credit facility and our subsidiary s first mortgage notes may prevent us from engaging in transactions or capitalizing on business opportunities that we believe could be beneficial to us by requiring us to comply with various covenants  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on incurring additional debt  entering into mergers or consolidations or sales of assets  and granting liens 
although the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional debt  they impose restrictions on our ability to enter into mergers or consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  to incur liens to secure debt and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
a breach of any restriction under our credit facility or our indentures or our subsidiary s first mortgage notes could permit the holders of the related debt to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements immediately due and payable and  in the case of our credit facility  terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
any subsequent refinancing of our current debt or any new indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have similar or greater restrictions 
tax risks to common unitholders the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if we were to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to additional amounts of entity level taxation for state tax purposes  then our cash available for distribution to unitholders could be substantially reduced 
as long as we qualify to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  we are not subject to federal income tax 
although a publicly traded limited partnership is generally treated as corporation for federal income tax purposes  a publicly traded partnership such as us can qualify to be treated as a partnership for federal 
table of contents 
index to financial statements income tax purposes under current law so long as for each taxable year at least of our gross income is derived from specified investments and activities 
we believe that we qualify to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes because we believe that at least of our gross income for each taxable year has been and is derived from such specified investments and activities 
although we intend to meet this gross income requirement  we may not find it possible  regardless of our efforts  to meet this gross income requirement or may inadvertently fail to meet this gross income requirement 
if we do not meet this gross income requirement for any taxable year and the internal revenue service the irs does not determine that such failure was inadvertent  we would be treated as a corporation for such taxable year and each taxable year thereafter 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or certain other matters affecting us 
additionally  current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes without regard to our sources of income or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
legislation has been proposed that would eliminate partnership tax treatment for certain publicly traded partnerships 
although such legislation would not apply to us as currently proposed  it could be amended prior to enactment in a manner that does apply to us 
we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted 
moreover  any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may be applied retroactively 
if we were to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of 
under current law  distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed as corporate distributions  and no income  gain  loss  or deduction would flow through to our unitholders 
if we were treated as a corporation at the state level  we may also be subject to the income tax provisions of certain states 
moreover  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise  or other forms of taxation 
for example  we are required to pay texas franchise tax at a minimum effective rate of of our gross income apportioned to texas in the prior year 
if we become subject to federal income tax and additional state taxes  the additional taxes we pay will reduce the amount of cash we can distribute each quarter to the holders of our class a and b common units and the number of i units that we will distribute quarterly 
therefore  our treatment as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or becoming subject to a material amount of additional state taxes could result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to our unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our units 
moreover  our payment of additional federal and state taxes could materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
if the irs contests our curative tax allocations or other federal income tax positions we take  the market for our class a common units may be impacted and the cost of any irs contest will reduce our cash available for distribution or payments on our debt securities 
our partnership agreement allows curative allocations of income  deduction  gain and loss by us to account for differences between the tax basis and fair market value of property at the time the property is contributed or deemed contributed to us and to account for differences between the fair market value and book basis of our assets existing at the time of issuance of any class a common units 
if the irs does not respect our curative allocations  ratios of taxable income to cash distributions received by the holders of class a common units will be materially higher than previously estimated 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions we have taken or may take on certain tax matters 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we have taken or may take 
a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we have taken or may take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our class a common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution or payments on our debt securities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the tax liability of our unitholders could exceed their distributions or proceeds from sales of class a common units 
because our unitholders will generally be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute  our unitholders will be required to pay any federal income tax and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their allocable share of our income  even if they do not receive cash distributions from us 
unitholders will not necessarily receive cash distributions equal to the tax on their allocable share of our taxable income 
tax gain or loss on the disposition of our class a common units could be more or less than expected 
if a unitholder disposes of class a common units  the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the unitholder s tax basis in those class a common units 
because distributions in excess of a unitholder s allocable share of our net taxable income decrease the unitholder s tax basis in their class a common units  the amount  if any  of such prior excess distributions with respect to their class a common units sold will  in effect  become taxable income to the unitholder if the class a common units are sold at a price greater than the unitholder s tax basis in those class a common units  even if the price the unitholder receives is less than the unitholder s original cost 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized includes a unitholder s share of our nonrecourse liabilities  if a unitholder sells class a common units  the unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale 
as a result of investing in our class a common units  a unitholder may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in the states where we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business 
in addition to federal income taxes  a unitholder will likely be subject to other taxes  including state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we or our subsidiaries conduct business or own property now or in the future  even if such unitholder does not live in any of those jurisdictions 
our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions 
further  our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business in the states of alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kansas  kentucky  louisiana  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  missouri  montana  new york  south carolina  north carolina  north dakota  oklahoma  tennessee  texas and wisconsin 
most of these states impose an income tax on individuals  corporations  and other entities 
as we make acquisitions or expand our business  we may acquire property or conduct business in additional states or in foreign jurisdictions that impose a personal income tax 
it is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all required us federal  foreign  state and local tax returns 
ownership of class a common units raises issues for tax exempt entities and other investors 
an investment in our class a common units by tax exempt entities  such as employee benefit plans  individual retirement accounts known as iras  keogh plans and other retirement plans  regulated investment companies and foreign persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non us persons will be required to file non us federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
tax exempt entities and non us persons should consult their tax adviser before investing in our class a common units 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and our unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the class a common units 
when we issue additional class a common units or engage in certain other transactions  we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and our general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  under our valuation methods  subsequent purchasers of class a common units may have a greater portion of their internal revenue code section b adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our valuation methods  or our allocation of the section b adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets  and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of class a common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the class a common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in our termination as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have been terminated for federal tax purposes if there are sales or exchanges which  in the aggregate  constitute or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve month period 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders  which would result in us filing two tax returns and our unitholders could receive two schedules k for one fiscal year and could result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions available in computing our taxable income 
in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in such unitholder s taxable income for the year of termination 
our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  but instead  we would be treated as a new partnership for federal tax purposes 
if treated as a new partnership for federal tax purposes  we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred 
we treat each purchaser of class a common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual class a common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could result in a unitholder owing more tax and may adversely affect the value of the class a common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of our class a common units and to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our class a common units  we have adopted certain depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
these positions may result in an understatement of deductions and losses and an overstatement of income and gain to our unitholders 
for example  we do not amortize certain goodwill assets  the value of which has been attributed to certain of our outstanding class a common units 
a subsequent holder of those class a common units is entitled to an amortization deduction attributable to that goodwill under internal revenue code section b 
however  because we cannot identify these class a common units once they are traded by the initial holder  we do not give any subsequent holder of a class a common unit any such amortization deduction 
this approach understates deductions available to those unitholders who own those class a common units and results in a reduction in the tax basis of those class a common units by the amount of the deductions that were allowable but were not taken 
the irs may challenge the manner in which we calculate our unitholder s basis adjustment under internal revenue code section b 
if so  because neither we nor a unitholder can identify the class a common units 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to which this issue relates once the initial holder has traded them  the irs may assert adjustments to all unitholders selling class a common units within the period under audit as if all unitholders owned class a common units with respect to which allowable deductions were not taken 
any position we take that is inconsistent with applicable treasury regulations may have to be disclosed on our federal income tax return 
this disclosure increases the likelihood that the irs will challenge our positions and propose adjustments to some or all of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to this position or other positions we may take could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from a unitholder s sale of class a common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the class a common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns 
a unitholder whose class a common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of class a common units may be considered as having disposed of those class a common units 
if so  such unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those class a common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a unitholder whose class a common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of class a common units may be considered as having disposed of those class a common units  such unitholder may no longer be treated as a partner with respect to those class a common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those class a common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those class a common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their class a common units

impact of current economic conditions the challenging economic conditions we faced at the beginning of appear to be improving at the outset of as a result of the decisive steps we took in  we began with stable investment grade credit ratings combined with adequate capital and liquidity to complete our commercially supported internal growth projects and maintain the current distribution rate to our unitholders 
in addition  we are well positioned to pursue opportunities for accretive acquisitions in or near the areas in which we have a competitive advantage 
throughout the year we took strategic steps to enhance our liquidity position and stabilize our credit ratings 
we limited our capital expenditure activities to those projects strategic to us 
we enhanced our liquidity and credit ratings by entering into a joint funding arrangement for the united states portion of the alberta clipper project with our general partner and other affiliates of ours and enbridge 
following our announcement of the alberta clipper joint funding arrangement  the major credit ratings agencies removed the negative outlooks on our long term debt ratings 
finally  in november  in an effort to further satisfy our financing needs  we sold non core natural gas pipeline assets located predominantly outside of texas for million as we discuss in more detail below in results of operations  natural gas other matters 
the steps we have taken are intended to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our remaining growth programs and sustain the present distribution rate to our unitholders  while preserving our credit rating 
although global economic conditions continue to slowly improve  we will maintain our focus on improving unitholder value through our commercially supported internal growth projects  while continually seeking opportunities to enhance the operational efficiency of our existing systems 
results of operations overview we provide services to our customers and returns for our unitholders primarily through the following activities interstate pipeline transportation and storage of crude oil and liquid petroleum  gathering  treating  processing and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids  or ngls  through pipelines and related facilities  and supply  transportation and sales services  including purchasing and selling natural gas and ngls 
we conduct our business through three business segments liquids  natural gas and marketing 
these segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of our long term objectives  to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance

our unhedged commodity position is fully exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices 
these fluctuations can be significant as evidenced by the volatility of commodity prices during we employ derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our commodity position and to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas  ngl and crude oil prices 
some of these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under the provisions of authoritative accounting guidance  which can create volatility in our earnings that can be significant 
however  these fluctuations in earnings do not affect our cash flow 
cash flow is only affected when we settle the derivative instrument 
summary analysis of operating results liquids our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota and mid continent systems 
these systems largely consist of ferc regulated interstate crude oil and liquid petroleum pipelines  gathering systems and storage facilities 
the lakehead system  together with the enbridge system in canada  forms the longest liquid petroleum pipeline system in the world 
these systems generate revenues primarily from charging shippers a rate per barrel to gather  transport and store crude oil and liquid petroleum 
operating income from our liquids segment increased million to million for the year ended december  from the million contributed for the year ended december  the increase in operating income of our liquids segment is primarily due to the following transportation rate increases that went into effect in january  april and july  which include increases in our tolls associated with the annual index rate ceiling adjustments  additional facilities added and a true up of prior year transportation rate surcharges  completion and start up of the second stage of our southern access project  and the phase v expansion of our north dakota system  
table of contents 
index to financial statements higher delivered volumes on our lakehead system associated with the ongoing development of the oil sands located in alberta referred to as the alberta oil sands  additional revenue we recognized in resulting from our joint tolling arrangement with mustang pipe line  llc  or mustang  revenue recognized in resulting from our application of regulatory accounting related to our southern access project and alberta clipper project  and additional spot storage fee revenue generated by our mid continent storage terminal system 
the above increases to operating income were partially offset by lower average crude oil prices associated with the allowance oil we receive  and increased operating costs and depreciation associated with the additional assets we have placed into service 
natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines as well as natural gas treating and processing plants and related facilities 
the revenues of our natural gas segment are associated with services we provide to gather and process natural gas and to transport natural gas on our pipelines 
generally  our revenues are in the form of fee for service arrangements and or sales of natural gas and ngls 
in november  we sold non core natural gas pipeline assets located predominantly outside of texas for cash totaling approximately million  excluding any subsequent settlement for working capital as provided in the sale agreement 
we have presented in income from discontinued operations the income and loss we derived from these assets for the years ended december   and we also recorded net impairment charges of million in the year ended december  related to the disposition of these natural gas assets 
the following factors affected the operating income of our natural gas business for the year ended december  compared to the same period of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net losses of million associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance in compared with million of net gains we experienced in the same period of  a decrease of approximately million in losses associated with the revaluation of our in kind natural gas imbalances and inventories due to less volatile commodities prices in as compared with the same period in  decline in transportation volumes associated with lower natural gas production in the areas we serve  improved system gain loss experience resulting from the processes and quality improvements implemented  hurricanes did not disrupt our operations in as they did in  and cost reduction measures we instituted in to address rising operating and administrative costs  partially offset by increased depreciation associated with our completed expansion projects 
marketing our marketing segment provides supply  transmission  storage and sales services to producers and wholesale customers on our gathering  transmission and customer pipelines  as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
our marketing activities are primarily undertaken to realize incremental revenue on gas purchased at the wellhead  increase pipeline utilization and provide other services that are valued by our customers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the operating results of our marketing segment for the year ended december  compared to the same period of were affected by the following a reduction in operating revenues and additional margin from the sale of natural gas to our customers as a result of narrowing natural gas transportation differentials between market centers and reduced market volatility  and unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains of million in compared to million of losses generated in the same period of associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance 
derivative transactions and hedging activities we use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates and reduce variability in our cash flows 
based on our risk management policies  all of our derivative financial instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability and or forecasted transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on commodity prices or interest rates 
we record all derivative instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair market value pursuant to the requirements of applicable authoritative accounting guidance

year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income for the year ended december   representing an increase of million over the same period in the favorable results are primarily attributable to transportation rate increases that went into effect during  partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs  and depreciation 
operating revenue for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the same period in the increase in operating revenue is due to the following increased average rates for transportation on all of our major systems as construction projects were completed as noted below  additional revenue we recognized in resulting from our joint tolling arrangement with mustang  higher delivered volumes on our lakehead system  
table of contents 
index to financial statements additional storage fee revenue generated by our mid continent storage terminal system  and revenue recognized in resulting from our application of the provisions of regulatory accounting 
these increases in operating revenue were partially offset by lower average crude oil prices associated with the allowance oil we receive in connection with our transportation services 
the increases in average transportation rates on all three liquids systems contributed approximately million of additional operating revenue 
the rate increases included the following effective january   we increased the rates for transportation on our north dakota system to include an updated calculation of the two surcharges related to the phase v expansion program  effective april   we increased the rates for transportation on our lakehead system in connection with the completion of stage of our southern access project 
we also increased the transportation rates on our lakehead system for additional facilities we added for which we receive a cost of service return and a true up for costs associated with our southern access stage project  and effective july   we increased the average transportation rates on all three of our liquids systems in connection with the annual index rate ceiling adjustment 
during the year ended december   we recognized an aggregate of approximately million of operating revenues associated with our lakehead system related to prior periods 
we recognized million of revenue after determining that we had incorrectly invoiced three shippers for transportation services provided from october through december in connection with a joint tariff arrangement between enbridge energy  limited partnership  or the olp  and mustang pipe line  llc  or mustang 
we also recognized million of revenue during the year ended december  for volumetric differences associated with the transportation of crude oil primarily during the years ended december  and the volumetric differences resulted from discrepancies between the volumes we measured as delivered to the mustang pipeline system at lockport  illinois and the volumes that mustang reported as delivered at patoka 
average delivery volumes on our lakehead system increased approximately percent  to million bpd for the year ended december  from million bpd during the same period in this increase contributed an additional million to operating revenue 
the increase in average deliveries on our lakehead system is primarily derived from increases of crude oil supplies from upstream production facilities associated with the ongoing development of the alberta oil sands 
the increases in crude oil supplies from the alberta oil sands are a result of two new upgraders that began operations in northern alberta during  the ramp up of expanding bitumen projects  and increased production out of the bakken formation located in the williston basin that covers parts of north dakota  montana  and saskatchewan 
also contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended december   was an approximately million increase in contract storage and spot storage fees generated by our mid continent storage terminal system 
our mid continent system includes approximately storage tanks we own with a total storage capacity of million barrels 
during  we recognized million of revenue and a corresponding regulatory receivable for amounts we will recover in future periods under the terms of the transportation agreements established for our southern access project 
the revenue we recognized is due to fewer volumes being transported on our system than anticipated when our current rates were established under the cost of service recovery model 
these revenues were earned during  but will not be realized as cash until when we update our transportation rates to account for the lower actual delivered volume than estimated 
in april  we applied the provisions of regulatory accounting to the operations of our southern access project when the facilities rate surcharge associated with the project was approved by the ferc 
the rates for the southern access project are based on a cost of service recovery model that follows the ferc s authoritative guidance and is subject to annual filing requirements with the ferc 
the rates we are allowed to charge shippers associated with our southern access project include an allowance that provides a rate of return to our partners 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our transportation tariffs allow our pipelines to deduct an allowance from our customers for the transportation of their crude oil 
we recognize revenue for this allowance at the prevailing market price for crude oil 
the average prices of crude oil during the year ended december  were substantially lower than the average prices for the same period of for example  the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil has decreased approximately percent for the year ended december   as compared with the same period in as a result of the decrease in crude oil prices  we have experienced an approximate million decrease in allowance oil revenues 
operating and administrative expenses for the liquids segment increased million for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the increase in these costs is primarily attributable to the following increased workforce related costs associated with the operational  administrative  regulatory  and compliance support necessary for our systems resulting from the recently completed expansions  higher operating costs associated with our lease of line from an affiliate of our general partner which contributed million to our costs  which we are recovering through a tolling surcharge on our lakehead system with the net effect on our cash flow and operating income expected to approximate zero over the life of the lease  increased costs for repair and maintenance activities and our pipeline integrity program  property tax increases associated with assets we have constructed and placed in service coupled with modest increases on existing assets 
additionally  no favorable property tax settlements were realized in  and increases in other variable costs incurred in relation to our expanded pipeline systems 
our general partner charges us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel who are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
we have experienced an increase in workforce related costs as a result of the growth and expansion of our liquids system operations 
power costs decreased million in the year ended december   compared with the same period in the decline in power costs is primarily associated with the additional capacity provided by our southern access project that has enabled us to more efficiently utilize our pipelines to transport crude oil 
the increase in depreciation expense of million is attributable to the additional assets we have placed in service during and  the most significant of which are the southern access project stage one and two assets that we placed in service during the second quarter of and the second quarter of  respectively 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income for the year ended december   representing an increase of over the same period in the favorable results are attributable to transportation rate increases that went into effect during  together with higher volumes transported on our liquids systems  partially offset by higher power  operating and administrative costs  and depreciation 
operating revenue for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the same period in the increase in operating revenue is due to the following increased average rates for transportation on all of our major systems as noted below  higher delivery volumes on our lakehead and north dakota systems  additional revenue resulting from higher crude oil prices associated with the allowance oil we receive in connection with our transportation services  and additional contract storage fee revenue generated by our mid continent storage terminal system 

table of contents 
index to financial statements increases in average transportation rates on all three liquids systems together with longer hauls contributed approximately million of additional operating revenue 
we filed new tariff rates in on our lakehead system  effective april   to reflect the recent completion of four projects the southern access mainline expansion  two superior terminal tank projects  two griffith terminal tank projects and the clearbrook manifold project 
we also implemented new tariff rates on our north dakota system  effective january   to reflect the completion of our north dakota phase v expansion 
additionally  we increased the average transportation rates on all three of our liquids systems in connection with the annual index rate ceiling adjustment that went into effect july  average delivery volumes on our lakehead system increased approximately percent  to million bpd for the year ended december  from million bpd during the same period in this increase contributed an additional million to operating revenue 
the increase in average deliveries on our lakehead system is primarily derived from increases of crude oil supplies from upstream production facilities associated with the ongoing development of the alberta oil sands 
our transportation tariff allows our pipelines to deduct an allowance from our customers for the transportation of their crude oil 
we recognize revenue for this allowance at the prevailing market price for crude oil 
the average prices of crude oil during the year ended december  were substantially higher than the average prices for the same period of for example  the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased approximately percent for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in as a result of the increase in crude oil prices  we experienced an approximate million increase in allowance oil revenues 
also contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended december   was an approximately million increase in contract storage and spot storage fees generated by our mid continent storage terminal system from the additional storage tanks we placed in service during mid and late across our mid continent system  we added a net of seven storage tanks during contributing an additional million barrels of capacity bringing the total storage capacity to approximately million barrels and tanks 
this additional storage capacity is expected to provide ongoing fixed  variable  and spot storage revenue 
operating and administrative expenses for the liquids segment increased million for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the increase in these costs is primarily attributable to the following additional workforce related costs for the operational  administrative  regulatory  and compliance support services necessary for our growing systems  increased costs related to repair and maintenance activities  unfavorable oil measurement adjustments as described below  further costs incurred in connection with the crude oil release and fire on line of our lakehead system  and modest increases in property taxes due to favorable settlements of property tax assessments that we realized during the year ended december  which were not present for the same period in oil measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operations associated with our liquid petroleum operations 
the three types of oil measurement adjustments that routinely occur on our systems include physical  which result from evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement including sediment and water measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents  degradation resulting from mixing at the interface of our pipeline systems or within our terminals between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation  which are a function of crude oil prices  the level of our carriers inventory and the inventory positions of customers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements power costs increased million in the year ended december   compared with the same period in  predominantly due to the higher delivery volumes coupled with higher utility rates we are charged by our power suppliers 
we have experienced a trend of increasing electricity rates from our power suppliers due to higher natural gas and coal costs associated with volatile pricing of these commodities 
the increase in depreciation expense of million is attributable to the additional assets we have placed in service during and for the year ended december   including the southern access expansion stage one assets that we placed in service during the second quarter of along with the assets placed into service on our north dakota and mid continent systems 
other matters spearhead pipeline acquisition in may  we purchased a portion of a crude oil pipeline system from ccps transportation  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of our general partner  for approximately million  representing the carrying value in the records of our general partner 
the portion of the system  which we refer to as spearhead north  includes approximately seven storage tanks and miles of pipeline that our general partner reversed to provide northbound service from flanagan  illinois to griffith  indiana 
the acquisition of spearhead north complements the existing operations of our lakehead system  as our newly constructed southern access pipeline ends in flanagan where it connects to spearhead north 
line exchange and lease in connection with the development of a diluent pipeline being constructed by enbridge pipelines southern lights  llc  or southern lights  a wholly owned subsidiary of our general partner  we completed the transfer of a mile section of pipeline  which we refer to as line  from our lakehead system to southern lights in exchange for a newly constructed pipeline for transporting light sour crude oil 
in connection with the exchange  at the request of shippers and to ensure adequate southbound pipeline capacity prior to the completion of the alberta clipper project  we agreed to lease line from southern lights for monthly payments of million 
the transfer and lease became effective february   which was the in service date for the light sour pipeline 
the lease of line will be effective until the earliest of i july   ii upon the transfer of the canadian portion of line from enbridge pipelines  inc  or enbridge pipelines  to enbridge southern lights lp  a wholly owned subsidiary of enbridge pipelines or iii early termination of the lease 
we are able to terminate the lease at any time during the term by providing southern lights with written notice  at which time we would be required to return line to southern lights 
the costs associated with the lease are being recovered through a tolling surcharge on our lakehead system and the net effect on our cash flow over the life of the transaction is expected to approximate zero 
the exchange resulted in a million increase in property  plant and equipment and the capital account of our general partner included in partners capital on our december  consolidated statement of financial position  representing the million cost of the light sour pipeline that was in excess of the million net book value of the line assets we exchanged 
subsequent to the initial exchange  an additional million of costs were incurred by southern lights through december  that have been transferred to us through the capital account of our general partner  which are included in the million cost presented above 
the light sour pipeline is newer and has a slightly higher capacity than line  which will allow us to transport additional volumes of light sour crude oil on our lakehead system with less integrity and maintenance costs  although depreciation and property tax expense is anticipated to increase in future periods due to the higher book value associated with these assets 
future prospects for liquids historically  western canada has been a key source of oil supply serving us energy needs 
canada s oil sands  one of the largest oil reserves in the world  are becoming an increasingly prominent source of supply 
combined conventional and oil sands established reserves of approximately billion barrels compare with saudi arabia s proved reserves of approximately billion barrels 
the national energy board of canada  or neb  estimates that total western canadian sedimentary basin  or wcsb  production averaged approximately 
table of contents 
index to financial statements million bpd in and million bpd in relative to recent years  development of the alberta oil sands is expected to moderate due to declining demand and volatile commodity prices and it is unlikely that all announced and planned oil sands projects will proceed as planned 
the canadian association of petroleum producers  or capp  in june estimated future production from the alberta oil sands to grow steadily during the next years  with an additional million bpd of incremental supply available by  based on a subset of currently approved applications and announced expansions 
we and enbridge are actively working with our customers to develop transportation options that will allow canadian crude oil greater access to markets in the united states 
crude oil price volatility in and has caused some oil sands producers to cancel or defer projects that were planned to commence over the next decade 
cancellations and project deferrals of oil sands projects are expected to temper the rate of growth over the next several years relative to prior forecasts 
if the rate of crude oil production from the western canadian sedimentary basin declines  immediate need for new pipeline infrastructure will likely decline 
in addition to our expansions  a competitor pipeline system is expected to be placed into service during to transport crude oil from hardisty to wood river and patoka and to cushing  with an initial capacity of  bpd and an ultimate capacity of  bpd 
this competing pipeline  together with our southern access and alberta clipper expansions should provide sufficient pipeline capacity in the near term to meet the demand for transportation of crude oil production derived from the alberta oil sands 
therefore  further expansion activities in and around our liquids systems will primarily focus on additional storage opportunities in the cushing region and further development of our north dakota system 
partnership projects southern access we completed the second and final stage of our southern access project and placed it into service on april  the related tolling surcharge has been adjusted to include costs of this phase of the expansion and became effective april  this stage provides additional upstream pumping capacity and a new pipeline from delavan  wisconsin to flanagan 
completion of the total southern access project created a inch  mile pipeline with approximately  bpd of incremental capacity on our lakehead system  which can be further expanded to million bpd with expenditures for additional pumping equipment 
the commercial structure for this expansion is a cost of service based surcharge that has been added to the existing transportation rates 
we anticipate that earnings before interest  income tax  depreciation and amortization expenses associated with this project will be approximately million to million annually in the first full year that both stages of the southern access project are fully operational 
alberta clipper the alberta clipper project involves construction of a new inch diameter pipeline from hardisty to superior  generally within or alongside our existing rights of way in the united states and enbridge s existing rights of way in canada 
the alberta clipper project will interconnect with our existing mainline system in superior where it will provide access to our full range of delivery points and storage options  including chicago  toledo  sarnia  patoka and cushing 
the project will have an initial capacity of  bpd  is expandable to  bpd and will form part of the existing enbridge system in canada and our lakehead system in the united states 
the alberta clipper project is a fully cost of service agreement with a return of basis points over the neb multi pipeline rate of return 
construction on the canadian segment of the alberta clipper project was mechanically completed in december  and remains on schedule to be ready for service on april  this segment has an estimated cost of billion cad  including allowance for funds used during construction afudc  with expenditures to date totaling billion cad 
as of january  construction is approximately complete on the united states segment  and it also remains on schedule to be ready for service by april  the cost of the united states segment is estimated at billion  with expenditures to date totaling billion 
as announced in july 
table of contents 
index to financial statements  enbridge has committed to fund of the united states segment of the alberta clipper project through us and our subsidiaries 
similar to the southern access project  the costs of the alberta clipper project are expected to be recoverable through surcharges on mainline tolls in both canada and the united states 
we are financing the billion of expected construction costs for the united states portion of the project through a joint funding arrangement whereby our general partner and other affiliates of ours and enbridge participate jointly in financing a portion of the construction project in return for an interest in approximately two thirds of the earnings and cash flows 
the joint funding arrangement also contemplates our issuance of additional term debt in one or more capital markets transactions  following the in service date of the project  to refinance our initial debt financing of the project 
our general partner will also refinance its portion of its initial debt financing of the project on the same terms 
we anticipate that the first full year earnings before interest  income tax  depreciation and amortization expenses resulting from operating this pipeline project will approximate million  of which we will be entitled to approximately million 
we expect the increase in transportation rates associated with the alberta clipper project to contribute to our revenues beginning in the second quarter of for both the canadian and united states segments of the alberta clipper project  tariffs will be filed with the appropriate regulators to be effective on april   the date the project is expected to be ready for service 
the tariff for the united states segment  and its effective date  will be filed on the basis of the alberta clipper us term sheet  despite a petition filed in january by a shipper requesting the ferc to delay the tariff 
following that petition filing  several shippers filed interventions requesting to be part of the process 
the alberta clipper us term sheet was approved by capp on june  and by the ferc on august  we have reviewed and will respond to the shipper petition  which we believe to be without merit 
north dakota in december  we completed an approximate billion further expansion of our north dakota system  which consists of upgrades to existing pump stations  additional tankage  as well as extensive use of drag reducing agents  or dra  that are injected into the pipeline 
this expansion of our north dakota system  referred to as phase vi  increased system capacity to  bpd from the  bpd that was previously available 
the related tolling surcharge has been adjusted to include costs of this phase of the expansion that became effective january  the commercial structure for this expansion is a cost of service based surcharge that was added to the existing transportation rates 
the tolling methodology is similar to the structure being used on the recently completed phase v expansion project and was approved by the ferc in october enbridge and other projects spearhead pipeline enbridge completed construction on the  bpd expansion of the spearhead pipeline to a capacity of approximately  bpd on schedule in early and commenced operation in may the spearhead pipeline is complementary to our lakehead system as western canadian crude oil is carried on our lakehead system as far as chicago and then transferred to the spearhead pipeline 
natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  as well as treating and processing plants and related facilities 
collectively  these systems include approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  nine natural gas treating plants and natural gas processing plants  excluding inactive plants and including plants that we idle from time to time based on current volumes  and trucks  trailers and railcars used for transporting ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the following tables set forth the operating results of our natural gas segment assets and approximate average daily volumes of our major systems in millions of british thermal units per day  or mmbtu d  for the periods presented and amounts have been revised to exclude the results of our discontinued operations  which are discussed below in the section labeled other matters

we derive revenue in our natural gas segment from the following types of arrangements fee based arrangements under a fee based contract  we receive a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transporting raw natural gas and providing other similar services 
these revenues correspond with the volumes and types of services we provide and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
revenues of our natural gas segment that are derived from transmission services consist of reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas on some of our intrastate pipeline systems 
customers paying these fees typically pay a reservation fee each month to reserve capacity plus a nominal commodity charge based on actual transmission volumes 
additional revenues from our intrastate pipelines are derived from the combined sales of natural gas and transmission services 
other arrangements we also use other types of arrangements to derive revenues for our natural gas segment 
these arrangements expose us to commodity price risk  which we substantially mitigate with offsetting physical purchases and sales of natural gas  ngls and condensate  and by the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge open positions in these commodities 
we hedge a significant amount of our exposure to commodity price risk to support the stability of our cash flows 
we provide additional information in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report about the derivative activities we use to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk 
the other types of arrangements we use to derive revenues for our natural gas business are categorized as follows percentage of proceeds contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of the natural gas and ngls we process in the form of residue natural gas  ngls  condensate and sulfur  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 

table of contents 
index to financial statements percentage of liquids contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of ngls and condensate extracted from natural gas that requires processing  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 
this contract structure is similar to percentage of proceeds arrangements except that we only receive a percentage of the ngls and condensate 
percentage of index contracts under these contracts  we purchase raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index price 
we then resell the natural gas  generally for the index price  keeping the difference as our fee 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  we gather or purchase raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased natural gas is consumed during processing 
we extract and retain the ngls produced during processing for our own account  which we sell at market prices 
in instances where we purchase raw natural gas at the wellhead  we also sell for our own account at market prices  the resulting residue gas 
in those instances when we gather and process raw natural gas for the account of the producer  we must return to the producer residue natural gas with an energy content equivalent to the original raw natural gas we received as measured in british thermal units  or btu 
under the terms of each of these contract structures  we retain a portion of the natural gas and ngls as our fee in exchange for providing these producers with our services 
we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices in the near term on approximately to percent of the natural gas  ngls and condensate we expect to receive as compensation for our services 
as a result of entering into these derivative instruments  we have largely fixed the amount of cash that we will pay and receive in the future when we sell the processed natural gas  ngls and condensate  even though the market price of these commodities will continue to fluctuate during that time 
many of the derivative financial instruments we use do not qualify for hedge accounting 
as a result we record the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting in our operating results 
this accounting treatment produces unrealized non cash gains and losses in our reported operating results that can be significant during periods when the commodity price environment is volatile 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment contributed million of operating income for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the million contributed in the corresponding period of the following discussion presents the primary factors affecting the operating income of our natural gas business for the year ended december  as compared with the same period of a million decrease resulting from million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net losses from derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance  as compared with gains of million for the same period of  lower average daily volumes of natural gas on our systems  as a result of lower natural gas production associated with reduced drilling by natural gas producers in the areas we serve  a decrease of approximately million in revaluation losses associated with our inventories and in kind natural gas imbalances due to less volatile commodity prices during the year of when compared to the same period in  improved system gain loss experience resulting from the processes and quality improvements implemented  hurricanes did not disrupt our operations in as they did in  and cost reduction measures we instituted in to address rising operating and administrative costs  partially offset by higher depreciation expense associated with our system growth 
changes in the average forward and daily prices of natural gas  ngls and condensate from december  to december   produced unrealized  non cash  mark to market net losses of million for the year ended december  from the derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting we use to economically hedge a portion of the natural gas  ngls and condensate associated with our natural gas business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the average forward and daily prices for natural gas were lower at december  in relation to prices at december   producing gains in our portfolio of natural gas derivatives  while the average forward and daily prices for ngls and condensate were higher at december  than at december   producing losses 
comparatively  at december   the average forward and daily prices for both natural gas and ngls were significantly lower than the prices at december   which produced million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains for the derivative instruments we used to fix the price of the natural gas purchased for processing and for the derivatives we used to hedge the sales prices of a portion of the ngls derived from processing natural gas 
the following table depicts the effect that unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains and losses had on the operating results of our natural gas segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  in millions hedge ineffectiveness non qualified hedges derivative fair value gains losses revenue for our natural gas business is derived from the fees or commodities we receive from the gathering  transportation  processing and treating of natural gas and ngls for our customers 
we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices in the near term on approximately to percent of the natural gas  ngls and condensate we expect to receive as compensation for our services 
as a result of this unhedged commodity price exposure  our margins generally increase when the prices of these commodities are rising and generally decrease when the prices are declining 
during the year ended december   ngl and condensate prices increased  while natural gas prices declined  creating a favorable environment for processing ngl and condensate 
comparatively  during the year ended december   commodity prices for ngl  condensate and natural gas experienced significant price erosion 
the rapid decline in commodity prices during the year ended december   led to million of revaluation losses with respect to our in kind natural gas imbalances as well as million of non cash charges to reduce the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to fair market value 
although commodity prices were significantly lower for the year ended december   when compared to the same period in  a rapid decline in commodity prices did not occur and as a result we did not incur similar revaluation losses and non cash charges in the period 
our volumes and revenues are the result of wellhead supply contracts and drilling activity in the areas served by our natural gas business  primarily the bossier trend  barnett shale  granite wash  and most recently the haynesville shale 
during the year ended december   natural gas volumes on our systems decreased percent resulting from declines in production and shut in natural gas 
due to the significant decline in natural gas prices over the past year  producers have reduced drilling activity levels compared to and the number of approved drilling permits in texas for the year ended december  has declined from the same period in existing active drilling rigs in the areas we serve have also declined during the year ended december  from levels that existed in the corresponding period in although conditions in the overall commodities markets have stabilized when compared to the volatility that existed in  natural gas rig counts remain below recent peak levels 
weak demand coupled with low commodity prices have resulted in lower volumes being transported on our systems 
as commodity prices continue to stabilize  natural gas producers will likely increase drilling activity in the areas we serve 
we are positioned to capitalize on any future increases in natural gas production  in large part due to the expansions we have completed 
another factor that could lead to more demand for our services is the recent discovery of the haynesville shale in western louisiana and eastern texas 
the haynesville shale has the potential of being the largest natural gas discovery in the united states 
if proven  the discovery could create more drilling activity around our east texas system  increasing the demand for our services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements a variable element of our natural gas segment s operating income is derived from processing natural gas under keep whole arrangements on our east texas  north texas and anadarko systems 
operating income derived from keep whole processing arrangements for the year ended december  was million  representing a decrease of million  or percent  from the million we produced for the same period in the favorable pricing environment that existed for ngls and condensate for the year ended december  was less favorable for the same period in  reducing the operating income we derive from keep whole processing arrangements 
natural gas measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines 
the quantification and resolution of measurement losses is complicated by several factors including varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems  changes in weather  temperatures and variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies 
during the year ended december  we recognized approximately million fewer losses related to measurement than in the same period for we implemented processes and quality improvements to enhance the operating conditions on our natural gas systems  which continue to reduce the level of system gain loss 
during the months from september to december  we experienced operational disruptions to our onshore natural gas facilities as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike 
our facilities sustained minimal physical damage from the hurricanes  although some of our natural gas systems had lower throughput and revenues from the months of september to december due to the inability of third party downstream facilities to receive deliveries of our natural gas and ngls 
these temporary disruptions curtailed our ability to gather unprocessed natural gas at our processing plants and transport natural gas to markets in the texas and louisiana regions 
approximately million of lost revenue associated with the hurricanes occurred during the september to december timeframe 
hurricanes did not disrupt our natural gas operations during the year ended december  operating and administrative costs of our natural gas segment were million lower for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to our implementation of enhanced cost reduction measures 
our efforts to closely monitor and reduce expenditures have yielded positive results by reducing the costs associated with material and supplies purchases  consolidating spend with particular vendors and lowering the costs for repairs and maintenance activities when compared to the year ended december  our cost reduction measures included temporarily idling some of our processing and treating facilities in response to current economic conditions 
the lower operating and administrative costs were partially offset by greater depreciation expense for our natural gas segment for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  as a result of the capital projects completed and placed into service in year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment contributed million of operating income for the year ended december   an increase of million from the million contributed in the corresponding period of the following discussion presents the primary factors affecting the operating income of our natural gas business for the year ended december  as compared with the same period of million of unrealized  non cash mark to market net gains from derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance  as compared with losses of million for the same period of  volume growth associated with the substantial completion of our east texas natural gas system expansion and extension  referred to as the clarity project  coupled with strong production from the bossier trend  granite wash and barnett shale formations  reduced revenues of approximately million associated with the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike in the third and fourth quarters of  when third party facilities downstream of our operations were damaged or without power 
physical damage to our facilities was minimal with certain of our natural gas assets incurring capital and operating costs of approximately million for repairs 
our three major natural gas systems have been returned to pre hurricane levels

index to financial statements increased use of fee based arrangements to compensate us for our services are at lower margins relative to contract structures that contain commodity price risk  declines in the prices of natural gas and ngls from july to december  decreased the value of our in kind natural gas imbalance receivables and produced non cash charges to reduce the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to net realizable value  and increased workforce  repair and maintenance  materials and supplies  property taxes and depreciation associated with our system growth 
the operating income of our natural gas segment for the year ended december  was positively affected by unrealized non cash  mark to market net gains of million  representing an increase of million from the million of losses we recorded for the same period of during the second half of  significant declines in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas  ngls and condensate produced non cash  mark to market net gains in our portfolio of derivative instruments 
the declining price environment that was prevalent during the second half of was not present during most of the year ended december  we expect the net mark to market gains to be offset when the related physical transactions are settled 
despite the substantial fluctuations in commodity prices during  an overall favorable pricing environment contributed to higher average prices for the sale of natural gas and ngls we receive as in kind payment for our services 
the improved margins were also enhanced by an approximate increase in average daily volumes on our natural gas systems 
the increase in average daily volume of our natural gas business is directly attributable to the significant investments we have made to expand the capacity and service capability of our systems 
we completed the following projects during the years ended december  and  which have contributed to the increase in average daily volumes and operating results of our major natural gas systems in may our expansion of the aker treating plant on our east texas system was completed and placed into service adding million cubic feet per day  or mmcf d  of treating capacity 
the million expansion and extension of our east texas natural gas system  referred to as the clarity project  is substantially complete and includes the goodrich compressor station was constructed and placed into service in december  a inch diameter pipeline segment that extends from kountze to orange county was placed into service in july  a inch segment from orange county to a downstream interconnect near beaumont enabling deliveries into the interconnect was placed into service in december  construction of the orange county compressor station is nearly complete and is expected to be placed into service in february  a inch diameter pipeline that extends from goodrich to kountze was completed in october  which enables deliveries into a major interstate pipeline  a inch diameter pipeline that extends from an interconnect with our existing pipeline at bethel to crockett  texas was completed and placed into service in late july  a inch diameter pipeline in close proximity to our marquez treating facility was completed and placed into service in june  a inch diameter pipeline that runs from the marquez treating facility to crockett and the inch diameter pipeline that runs from crockett to goodrich  texas were both completed and placed into service in late march  and the marquez treating plant with capacity of approximately mmcf d and additional pipeline capacity to the existing southeast section of this area was completed and placed into service in march 
table of contents 
index to financial statements we expect to finish the final compression station during the first quarter of the total added capacity related to this project when completed will approximate mmcf d 
in the first quarter of we completed construction of a mile  inch diameter pipeline from a lateral on our east texas system to gather additional production being developed in east texas 
construction of the weatherford gas processing facility within our north texas system was completed in september with a processing capacity of approximately mmcf d 
at the end of  additional processing capacity was added to the weatherford processing facility to increase its capacity from mmcf day to mmcf day 
in the latter half of  we completed construction of three hydrocarbon dewpoint control facilities on our east texas system to add processing capacity to meet the increasingly more stringent pipeline gas quality specifications 
these facilities have a cumulative capacity of mmcf d and obtain a significant portion of their revenues from fees rather than keep whole processing or percentage of liquids revenues 
construction of the hidetown processing facility on our anadarko system with approximate capacity of mmcf d was completed and placed into service at the end of april during the second quarter of  we refurbished our zybach processing plant to address operational inefficiencies experienced by the plant 
as a result of the service and repairs  processing volumes were restored to expected levels 
the processing margins we derive from processing natural gas under keep whole arrangements that exist within our east texas  north texas and anadarko systems declined percent for the year ended december  in relation to the same period of operating income derived from keep whole processing arrangements for the year ended december  was million  representing a decrease of million from the million we produced for the same period in during the last half of  ngl and crude oil prices began to decline faster than natural gas prices  which have the effect of reducing revenue we derive from our processing assets 
in addition we continue to experience a trend of replacing or renegotiating some of our existing keep whole contracts with percentage of liquids  or pol  type contracts and other similar arrangements 
this trend should reduce our exposure to the commodity price spread between natural gas and ngls for the portion of the operating income we derive from processing natural gas under keep whole arrangements 
during the months from september to december  we experienced operational disruptions to our natural gas facilities as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike 
our facilities in texas sustained minimal physical damage from the hurricanes  although some of our natural gas systems had lower throughput and revenues for the months of september through december due to the inability of third party downstream facilities to receive deliveries of our natural gas and ngls 
these temporary disruptions curtailed our ability to gather unprocessed natural gas at our processing plants  transport natural gas to markets  and to access natural gas liquids we own at third party facilities held under force majeure 
our lost revenue associated with the hurricanes approximates million 
we did not recover any of these losses through insurance 
the majority of our facilities returned to normal operation by the end of september as a result of the significant price erosion in daily natural gas prices in the second half of  we recorded million of revaluation losses with respect to our in kind natural gas imbalances 
ngl prices also experienced similar declines in prices which required us to recognize million of charges to reduce the cost basis of our ngls 
operating and administrative costs of our natural gas segment were million greater for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of increased workforce related costs associated with the expansion of our systems  maintenance activities and other costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
our general partner charges us for the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel that are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
in addition we have experienced an increase in outside contract labor cost  given the high demand and competitive rates within our industry as a result of pipeline expansions across the areas we serve 

table of contents 
index to financial statements materials  supplies and other costs along with repair and maintenance costs were higher predominantly due to the increase in volumes and expansion of our natural gas systems 
repair and maintenance costs include compressor maintenance  downtime for routine and unscheduled maintenance  pipeline integrity costs and other similar items that have increased with the expansion of our natural gas systems 
we expect workforce related costs in addition to materials  supplies and other costs to increase in relation to the increase in volumes of natural gas services we provide 
depreciation expense for our natural gas segment was higher for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  as a result of the capital projects completed and placed into service throughout and the last quarter of in september  we acquired the transportation assets of petron  a trucking company located in alexandria  louisiana  for million in cash 
the acquisition was necessitated by the growing supply of ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide from our processing facilities  as well as the need to better serve our us gulf coast customers 
the operations of the newly acquired truck fleet increased our operating and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of future prospects for natural gas during  the volatility that existed in the capital markets required us to implement a less aggressive capital program in our natural gas business 
we will continue to maintain a focus on internal growth programs  even though the disruption to capital markets has begun to subside 
also  if opportunities should arise for us to expand our natural gas systems through accretive acquisitions in or near the areas we serve  we will pursue them on a selected basis 
the haynesville shale has been referred to as one of the largest natural gas fields in the continental united states 
drilling activity has been increasing over the last two years  as initial discoveries have yielded high production rates and low drilling costs relative to other areas in the united states 
this production area is defined as being within western louisiana and east texas areas  with a substantial amount of the texas production overlaying our existing natural gas assets 
this has enabled us to pursue new development opportunities  such as the shelby county loop project  even though overall capital spending by producers has been reduced 
we are continuing to look for more opportunities to leverage the developing haynesville shale area  as we believe we are well positioned with the scale of our east texas assets 
partnership projects haynesville shale expansion in february  we announced plans to expand our east texas system by constructing three lateral pipelines into the east texas portion of the haynesville shale 
in addition  we plan to construct a large diameter lateral pipeline from shelby county to carthage  expanding our recently completed shelby county loop expansion 
the expansion into the haynesville shale area is expected to increase our capacity in our east texas system to mmcf d 
shelby county loop and compression we commenced construction during the third quarter of to add compression at the carthage hub and on the shelby county lateral sections of our east texas system 
we have also initiated construction to increase the capacity of the east texas system in the area by installing approximately miles of inch pipeline 
during the second quarter of  construction on the approximately million project was substantially completed with additional compression added in the third quarter of

the mile pipeline  which is expected to have a capacity of at least one billion cubic feet per day  is designed to provide an outlet for increasing supplies of natural gas originating in the east texas and fort worth producing basins and in the growing haynesville shale play 
the pipeline would interconnect with pipelines accessing the perryville  louisiana hub as well as louisiana industrial markets and pipelines serving southeastern us markets 
the pipeline would provide our customers with additional markets and options when transporting their natural gas

other matters asset disposition in november  we sold our non core natural gas pipeline assets located predominantly outside of texas for cash totaling approximately million excluding any subsequent settlement for working capital as provided in the sale agreement 
the natural gas pipeline assets we sold include primarily intrastate and interstate natural gas transmission systems and related facilities  which serve onshore and offshore markets in the southeastern united states and along the gulf coast 
the natural gas pipeline assets include over  miles of pipeline with diameters ranging from to inches 
the areas in which the natural gas pipeline assets operate are not strategic to the ongoing central operations of our core natural gas segment assets 
the following table presents the operating results of the non core natural gas pipeline assets that we sold in november we derived the results from historical financial information and have excluded these amounts from our discussion of the operating results of our natural gas business 
included in the operating results are net charges of million which represent a charge for million we recorded as an impairment to reduce the carrying value of the assets to our estimate of the fair value of these assets  partially offset by a million reduction to this amount we realized upon the completion of the sale

kpc is an interstate natural gas transmission system  which serves the wichita  kansas and kansas city  kansas markets and includes approximately  miles of pipeline ranging in diameter from to inches  along with three compressor stations 
kpc represented a business within our natural gas segment that we did not consider strategic to the ongoing central operations of our core natural gas segment assets 
the operating results of the kpc system were not material to our consolidated operating results or those of our natural gas segment for the year ended december  we recognized a gain of million on the sale of kpc  which is presented in income from discontinued operations 
marketing the following table sets forth the operating results for the marketing segment assets for the periods presented and amounts have been revised to exclude the results of our discontinued operations related to the sale of non core natural gas assets in november  as discussed in the section labeled natural gas for the year ended december  in millions operating results operating revenues cost of natural gas operating and administrative depreciation and amortization operating expenses operating income loss our marketing business derives a majority of its operating income from selling natural gas received from producers on our natural gas segment pipeline assets to customers requiring the natural gas 
a majority of the natural gas we purchase is produced in texas markets where we have expanded access to several interstate natural gas pipelines over the last several years  which we can use to transport natural gas to primary markets where it can be sold at more favorable prices 
our marketing business is exposed to commodity price fluctuations because the natural gas purchased by our marketing business is generally priced using an index that is different from the pricing index at which the gas is sold 
this price exposure arises from the relative difference in natural gas prices between the contracted index at which the natural gas is purchased and the index under which it is sold  otherwise known as the spread 
the spread can vary significantly due to local supply and demand factors 
wherever possible  this pricing exposure is economically hedged using derivative financial instruments 
however  the structure of these economic hedges often precludes our use of hedge accounting under authoritative accounting guidance  which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
in addition to the market access provided by our intrastate natural gas pipelines  our marketing business also contracts for firm transportation capacity on third party interstate and intrastate pipelines to allow access to additional markets 
to offset the demand charges associated with these transportation agreements  we look for market conditions that allow us to lock in the price differential between the pipeline receipt point and pipeline delivery point 
this allows our marketing business to lock in a fixed sales margin inclusive of pipeline demand charges 
we accomplish this by transacting basis swaps between the index where the natural gas is purchased and the index where the natural gas is sold 
by transacting a basis swap between those two indices  we can effectively lock in a margin on the combined natural gas purchase and the natural gas sale  mitigating our exposure to cash flow volatility that could arise in markets where transporting the natural gas becomes uneconomical 
however  the structure of these transactions precludes our use of hedge accounting under authoritative accounting guidance  which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition to natural gas basis swaps  we contract for storage to assist with balancing natural gas supply and end use market sales 
in order to mitigate the absolute price differential between the cost of injected natural gas and withdrawn natural gas  as well as storage fees  the injection and withdrawal price differential is hedged by buying fixed price swaps for the forecasted injection periods and selling fixed price swaps for the forecasted withdrawal periods 
when the injection and withdrawal spread increases or decreases in value as a result of market price movements  we can earn additional profit through the optimization of those hedges in both the forward and daily markets 
although all of these hedge strategies are sound economic hedging techniques  these types of financial transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under authoritative accounting guidance 
as such  the non qualified hedges are accounted for on a mark to market basis  and the periodic change in their market value  although non cash  will impact our operating results 
natural gas purchased and sold by our marketing segment is priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at their request  we will enter into long term  fixed price purchase or sales contracts with our customers and generally will enter into offsetting hedged positions under the same or similar terms 
marketing pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store and transport natural gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage  or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts  and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the operating income we derive from the sale of natural gas declined as a result of narrowing of the differences in the prices of natural gas between the prices we pay to purchase natural gas and the prices we receive for the natural gas we sell to customers for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in although the volumes that our marketing business received from our natural gas segment assets remained relatively stable when compared to the year ended december   the revenue and related margin from the sale of those natural gas volumes declined 
the volatility existing in the overall commodities markets during the year ended december   resulted in more opportunities for us to benefit from differences between the purchase and sales prices of natural gas  which resulted in higher operating income 
the less volatile pricing environment existing during the year ended december  reduced the differences between the purchase and sales prices of natural gas  which in turn reduced our operating income for the period 
the operating results of our marketing segment for the year ended december  were positively affected by unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains of million associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance 
the non cash  mark to market net gains during the year ended december  resulted from the continued narrowing of natural gas purchase and sales prices between market centers  which benefited our hedged transportation positions 
during the year ended december   increases in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas produced million of non cash  mark to market net losses in our portfolio of derivative instruments as a result of the lower fixed price hedged transportation positions we had on our natural gas purchases and sales 
we expect all mark to market net gains to be offset when the related physical transactions are settled 
operating and administrative costs for our marketing segment were million lower for the year ended december  compared to the same period in consistent with our natural gas business  our cost reduction initiatives implemented during resulted in lower operating and administrative costs 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating income of our marketing segment declined to million for the year ended december  from income of million for the corresponding period in included in the operating income for the year ended december  are approximately million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market losses 
table of contents 
index to financial statements associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under authoritative accounting guidance  compared to the million of unrealized mark to market net losses for the comparable period of the unrealized  mark to market net losses for the year ended december  result from decreases in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas from december  we expect the mark to market net losses to be offset when the related physical transactions are settled 
operating income for the year ended december  was also negatively affected by non cash charges of million we recorded to reduce the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to net realizable value  which is million more than the million non cash charge we recorded for the same period of natural gas and ngl prices declined significantly from the record highs experienced in july of due to our hedging structures  we expect that a majority of these charges will be offset by future financial transactions that will settle at the time the natural gas inventory is sold 
the operating and administrative expenses of our marketing business are slightly more for the year ended december  as compared with the same period of due to additional workforce related costs associated with the employees and related benefits for personnel that are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
corporate year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the corresponding period in the increase is primarily the result of a higher weighted average outstanding debt balance in as compared with  along with higher commitment fees we incurred to establish the day credit facilities that we terminated in december  along with increased amortization of debt issuance cost 
the debt issuances that impacted the entire year ended december  are as follows million of our senior notes issued in april  million of our senior notes issued in april  and million of our senior notes issued in december our weighted average interest rate was for the year ended december   as compared with for the same period in we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
our variable interest rate borrowing cost is determined at the time of each borrowing or interest rate reset based upon a posted london interbank offered rate  or libor  for the period of borrowing or interest rate reset  plus a defined credit spread 
in order to mitigate the negative effect high interest rates have on our cash flows  we purchased interest rate caps  which establish a ceiling averaging approximately on the interest rates we pay on up to million of our variable rate indebtedness through january the interest rate caps do not qualify for hedge accounting and  as a result  the fair values of these derivative financial instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position with the changes in fair value recorded as corresponding increases or decreases in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains associated with the changes in fair value of these derivatives that resulted from the increase in interest rates from the may date these derivative financial instruments were purchased to december

at december   we had approximately million in outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects for the construction of assets that will be recorded as property  plant and equipment during we expect to analyze potential acquisitions with a focus on natural gas pipelines  refined products pipelines  terminals  and related facilities 
we will seek opportunities for accretive acquisitions throughout the united states  particularly in the us gulf coast area  where asset acquisitions are anticipated in and around our existing natural gas business 
we expect that the funds needed to achieve such acquisitions will be obtained through a combination of cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities 
forecasted expenditures we categorize our capital expenditures as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets and includes the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life 
we also began including a portion of our expenditures for connecting natural gas wells  or well connects  to our natural gas gathering systems as core maintenance expenditures beginning in  which totaled million for the year ended december  enhancement expenditures include our capital expansion projects and other projects that improve the service capability of our existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable us to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards

index to financial statements we estimate our capital expenditures based upon our strategic operating and growth plans  which are also dependent upon our ability to produce or otherwise obtain the financing necessary to accomplish our growth objectives 
the following table sets forth our estimates of capital expenditures we expect to make for system enhancement and core maintenance for the year ending december  although we anticipate making the expenditures in  these estimates may change due to factors beyond our control  including weather related issues  construction timing  changes in supplier prices or poor economic conditions 
additionally  our estimates may also change as a result of decisions made at a later date to revise the scope of a project or undertake a particular capital program or an acquisition of assets 
we made capital expenditures of billion  including million on core maintenance activities  for the year ended december  for the full year ending december   we anticipate our capital expenditures to approximate the following total forecasted expenditures in billions system enhancements core maintenance activities alberta clipper we maintain a comprehensive integrity management program for our pipeline systems which relies on the latest technologies that include internal pipeline inspection tools 
these internal inspection tools identify internal and external corrosion  dents  cracking  stress corrosion cracking and combinations of these conditions 
we regularly assess the integrity of our pipelines utilizing the latest generations of metal loss  caliper and crack detection internal inspection tools 
we also conduct hydrostatic testing to determine the integrity of our pipeline systems 
accordingly  we incur substantial expenditures each year for our integrity management programs 
under our capitalization policy expenditures that replace major components of property or extend the useful lives of existing assets are capital in nature while expenditures to inspect and test our pipelines are usually considered operating expenses 
the capital components of our programs have increased over time as our pipeline systems age 
we anticipate beginning a comprehensive program in to upgrade sections of our liquids petroleum pipeline system located in eastern michigan that were installed in the late s 
this program will likely extend over several years and will require additional capital expenditures

core maintenance capital  however  is anticipated to increase over that period of time due to the growth of our pipeline systems and the aging of portions of these systems 
we anticipate funding the system enhancement capital expenditures temporarily through borrowing under the terms of our credit facility  with permanent debt and equity funding being obtained when appropriate 
core maintenance expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
we expect to incur continuing annual capital and operating expenditures for pipeline integrity measures to ensure both regulatory compliance and to maintain the overall integrity of our pipeline systems 
expenditure levels have continued to increase as pipelines age and require higher levels of inspection  maintenance and capital replacement 
acquisitions we continue to assess ways to generate value for our unitholders  including reviewing opportunities that may lead to acquisitions  dispositions or other strategic transactions  some of which may be material 
we evaluate opportunities against operational  strategic and financial benchmarks before pursuing 
in the current environment we will consider acquisitions in geographic areas of current focus where assets are complementary to our existing systems 
we will also consider acquisitions that step out from our current geographical areas and lines of business on a very selective basis

derivative activities we use derivative instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to mitigate the volatility of our cash flows and manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
based on our risk management policies  all of our derivative instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability or anticipated transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on commodity prices or interest rates

cash distributions we make quarterly distributions to our general partner and the holders of our limited partner interests in an amount equal to our available cash 
as defined in our partnership agreement  available cash represents for any calendar quarter  the sum of all of our cash receipts plus net reductions to reserves less all of our cash disbursements and net changes to reserves 
we retain reserves to provide for the proper conduct of our business  to stabilize distributions to our unitholders and the general partner and  as necessary  to comply with the terms of any of our agreements or obligations 
enbridge management  as the delegate of our general partner under a delegation of control agreement  computes the amount of our available cash 
as the owner of our i units  enbridge management does not receive distributions in cash 
instead  each time that we make a cash distribution to our general partner and the holders of our class a and class b common units  the number of i units owned by enbridge management and the percentage of our total units owned by enbridge management will increase automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement with the result that the number of i units owned by enbridge management will equal the number of enbridge management s listed and voting shares that are then outstanding 
the amount of this increase in i units is determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average price of one of enbridge management s listed shares on the nyse for the trading day period immediately preceding the ex dividend date for enbridge management s shares multiplied by the number of shares outstanding on the record date 
the cash equivalent amount of the additional i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to be made to our general partner 
in october  we effected the conversion of all our outstanding class c units into class a common units in accordance with the terms of our partnership agreement 
the conversion became effective upon the determination by our general partner that the converted class c units would have  as a substantive matter  like intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics  in all material respects  to the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of our outstanding class a common units 
our general partner made this determination after adjustments were made to the capital accounts of our limited partners in connection with the private placement of class a common units 
for purposes of calculating the sum of all distributions of available cash  the cash equivalent amount of the additional i units that are issued when a distribution of cash is made to our general partner and owners of our common units is treated as a distribution of available cash  even though the i unit holder will not receive cash 
we retain the cash for use in our operations to finance a portion of our capital expansion projects

our annual cash distribution rate is per unit  or per quarter for the years ended december  and we expect that all cash distributions will be paid out of operating cash flows over the long term 
however  from time to time  we may temporarily borrow under our credit facility or use cash retained by issuance of payment in kind distributions for the purpose of paying cash distributions 
we may do this until we realize the full impact of assets being developed on operations or to respond to expected short term aberrations in our performance caused by market disruption events or depressed commodity prices 
we expect that our major capital expansion projects will be accretive to distributable cash flow when they are completed and operational 
long term sustainability of our distributions is a key focus of the management assigned to oversee our operation 
increases in our distribution rate are made when sustainable for the long term and upon the approval of the board of directors of enbridge management 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements

we immediately shut down our pipelines in the vicinity and dispatched emergency response crews to oversee containment  cleanup and repair of the pipeline 
we completed the excavation and repairs and returned the line to service within five days 
line b was restarted january   once repairs on the pipeline were completed 
the volume of oil released was approximately  barrels  which was largely contained in an area surrounding the pipeline leak 
we continue to work with federal and state environmental and pipeline safety regulators to investigate the cause of the leak 
we have the potential of incurring additional costs in connection with this incident  including expenditures necessary to remediate any operating condition that is determined to have caused the incident 
we do not expect the costs related to the containment  cleanup and repair of the pipeline to significantly impact our operating results  cash flows or financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates our selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as new accounting pronouncements have been issued 
accounting decisions generally involve an interpretation of existing accounting principles and the use of judgment in applying those principles to the specific circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to comply with all applicable accounting principles and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of these principles is critical 
however  not all situations we encounter are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in such cases  we must use our best judgment to implement accounting policies that clearly and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements accurately present the substance of these situations 
we accomplish this by analyzing similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them and consulting with experts about the appropriate interpretation and application of the accounting literature to these situations 
in addition to the above  certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities 
the basis for our estimates is historical experience  consultation with experts and other sources we believe to be reliable 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate  actual results can and often do differ from these estimates 
any effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the following paragraphs address the more significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
each of these areas involve complex situations and a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates related to the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities with the audit  finance risk committee of enbridge management s board of directors 
revenue recognition and the estimation of revenues and cost of natural gas in general  we recognize revenue when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for our natural gas and marketing businesses  we must estimate our current month revenue and cost of natural gas to permit the timely preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we generally cannot compile actual billing information nor obtain actual vendor invoices within a timeframe that would permit the recording of this actual data prior to preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we record an estimate each month for our operating revenues and cost of natural gas based on the best available volume and price data for natural gas delivered and received  along with a true up of the prior month s estimate to equal the prior month s actual data 
as a result  there is one month of estimated data recorded in our operating revenues and cost of natural gas for each period reported 
we believe that the assumptions underlying these estimates will not be significantly different from the actual amounts due to the routine nature of these estimates and the consistency of our processes 
crude oil over short balance and crude oil measurement gains losses crude oil over short balance and crude oil measurement gains losses are inherent in the transportation of crude oil due to evaporation  measurement differences and blending of commodities in transit in addition to other factors 
we estimate our crude oil measurement gains losses and our crude oil over short balance based on mathematical calculations and physical measurements  which include assumptions about the type of crude oil  its market value  normal physical losses due to evaporation and capacity limitations of the system 
a material change in these assumptions may result in a change to the carrying value of our crude oil over short balance or revision of our crude oil measurement gain loss estimates 
we include the crude oil measurement gains losses in our operating and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income and the crude oil over short balance in accounts payable and other in the consolidated statements of financial position if the balance is a liability and in inventory if the balance is in an asset position 
capitalization policies  depreciation methods and impairment of property  plant and equipment we capitalize expenditures related to property  plant and equipment  subject to a minimum rule  that have a useful life greater than one year for assets purchased or constructed  existing assets that are replaced  
table of contents 
index to financial statements improved  or the useful lives have been extended  or all land  regardless of cost 
acquisitions of new assets  additions  replacements and improvements other than land costing less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance and repair costs  including any planned major maintenance activities  are expensed as incurred 
during construction  we capitalize direct costs  such as labor and materials  and other costs  such as direct overhead and interest at our weighted average cost of debt  and  in our regulated businesses that apply the authoritative accounting provisions applicable to regulated operations  an equity return component 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets and include the replacement of system components and equipment that are worn  obsolete or near the end of their useful lives 
examples of core maintenance expenditures include valve automation programs  cathodic protection  zero hour compression overhauls and electrical switchgear replacement programs 
enhancement expenditures improve the service capability of our existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable us to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards 
examples of enhancement expenditures include costs associated with installation of seals  liners and other equipment to reduce the risk of environmental contamination from crude oil storage tanks  costs of sleeving a major segment of a pipeline system following an integrity tool run  natural gas or crude oil well connects  natural gas plants and pipeline construction and expansion 
we also began including a portion of our capital expenditures for well connects associated with our natural gas system assets as core maintenance expenditures beginning in regulatory guidance issued by the ferc requires us to expense certain costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the us department of transportation s office of pipeline safety 
under this guidance  costs to prepare a plan to implement the program  identify high consequence areas  develop and maintain a record keeping system and inspect  test and report on the condition of affected pipeline segments to determine the need for repairs or replacements  are required to be expensed 
costs of modifying pipelines to permit in line inspections  certain costs associated with developing or enhancing computer software and costs associated with remedial mitigation actions to correct an identified condition continue to be capitalized 
we typically expense the cost of initial in line inspection programs  crack detection tool runs and hydrostatic testing costs conducted for the purposes of detecting manufacturing or construction defects consistent with industry practice and the regulatory guidance issued by the ferc 
however  we capitalize initial construction hydrostatic testing cost and subsequent hydrostatic testing programs conducted for the purpose of increasing pipeline capacity in accordance with our capitalization policies 
also capitalized are certain costs such as sleeving or recoating existing pipelines  unless the expenditures are incurred as a single event and not part of a major program  in which case we expense these costs as incurred 
we record property  plant and equipment at its original cost  which we depreciate on a straight line basis over the lesser of its estimated useful life or the estimated remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins the assets serve 
our determination of the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions  including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by our assets  normal wear and tear of the facilities  and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs 
we routinely utilize consultants and other experts to assist us in assessing the remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins we serve 
we record depreciation using the group method of depreciation which is commonly used by pipelines  utilities and similar entities 
under the group method  for all segments  upon the disposition of property  plant and equipment  the net book value less net proceeds is typically charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss on disposal is recognized 
however  when a separately identifiable group of assets  such as a stand alone pipeline system is sold  we recognize a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income for the difference between the cash received and the net book value of the assets sold 
changes in any of our assumptions may alter the rate at which we recognize depreciation in our consolidated financial statements 
at regular intervals  we retain the services of independent consultants to assist us with assessing the reasonableness of the useful lives we have established for the property  plant and equipment of our major systems 
based on the results of these assessments we may make modifications to the assumptions we use to determine our depreciation rates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment when events or circumstances such as economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors indicate we may not recover the carrying amount of the assets 
we continually monitor our businesses  the market and business environments to identify indicators that could suggest an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the asset for recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from operating the asset as a going concern 
these cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing  demand  competition  operating cost  contract renewals  and other factors 
we recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques 
the determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding future cash flows and weighted average cost of capital 
any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized 
goodwill is allocated to two of our segments  natural gas and marketing 
pursuant to the authoritative accounting provisions for goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill  but test it for impairment annually based on carrying values as of the end of the second quarter  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
in testing goodwill for impairment  we make critical assumptions that include but are not limited to projections of future financial performance  which include commodity price and volume assumptions  the expected growth rate of our natural gas and marketing assets  residual value of the assets and market weighted average cost of capital 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
at the time we determine that an impairment has occurred  we will reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value 
our intangible assets consist of customer contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas supply opportunities and contributions we have made in aid of construction activities that will benefit our operations 
we amortize these assets on a straight line basis over the weighted average useful lives of the underlying assets  representing the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
we evaluate the carrying value of our intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of intangibles  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the intangibles are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangibles and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the intangibles are written down to their fair value 
fair value measurements we apply the authoritative accounting provisions for measuring fair value to our derivative instruments and disclosures associated with our outstanding indebtedness 
we define fair value as an exit price representing the expected amount we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with market participants at the measurement date 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we employ a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs we use to measure fair value into three distinct categories based upon whether such inputs are observable in active markets or unobservable 
we classify assets and liabilities in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our methodology for categorizing assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value pursuant to this hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest level to unobservable inputs as outlined below level we include in this category the fair value of assets and liabilities that we measure based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
we consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
the fair value of our assets and liabilities included in this category consists primarily of exchange traded derivative instruments 
level we categorize the fair value of assets and liabilities that we measure with either directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the measurement date where pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets for the identical instrument as level this category includes both otc transactions valued using exchange traded pricing information in addition to assets and liabilities that we value using either models or other valuation methodologies derived from observable market data 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various inputs including a quoted prices for assets and liabilities  b time value  c volatility factors  and d current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the assets and liabilities  can be derived from observable data  or supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
level we include in this category the fair value of assets and liabilities that we measure based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs which are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources 
ie  values supported by lesser volumes of market activity 
we may also use these inputs with internally developed methodologies that result in our best estimate of the fair value 
level assets and liabilities primarily include debt and derivative instruments for which we do not have sufficient corroborating market evidence  such as binding broker quotes  to support classifying the asset or liability as level the approximate fair values of our long term debt obligations are determined using a standard methodology that incorporates pricing points that are obtained from independent third party investment dealers who actively make markets in our debt securities  which we use to calculate the present value of the principal obligation to be repaid at maturity and all future interest payment obligations for any debt outstanding 
we utilize a mid market pricing convention for valuation as a practical expedient for assigning fair value to our derivative assets and liabilities 
our assets are adjusted for the non performance risk of our counterparties using their credit default swap spread rates  which are updated quarterly 
likewise  in the case of our liabilities  our nonperformance risk is considered in the valuation  and are also adjusted quarterly based on current default swap spread rates on our outstanding indebtedness 
we present the fair value of our derivative contracts net of cash paid or received pursuant to collateral agreements on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated statements of financial position when we believe a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable master netting agreement 
our credit exposure for over the counter derivatives is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of the contracts 
as appropriate  valuations are adjusted for various factors such as credit and liquidity considerations 
derivative financial instruments our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt and commodity prices of natural gas  ngls  condensate and fractionation margins the relative price difference between the price we receive from ngl sales and the corresponding cost of natural gas purchases 
in order to manage the risks to unitholders  we use a variety of derivative financial instruments including futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to create

index to financial statements offsetting positions to specific commodity or interest rate exposures 
in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance  we record all derivative financial instruments on our consolidated statements of financial position at fair market value 
we record the fair market value of our derivative financial instruments in the consolidated statements of financial position as current and long term assets or liabilities on a net basis by counterparty 
derivative balances are shown net of cash collateral received or posted where master netting agreements exist 
for those instruments that qualify for hedge accounting under authoritative accounting guidance  the accounting treatment depends on the intended use and designation of each instrument 
for our derivative financial instruments related to commodities that do not qualify for hedge accounting  the change in market value is recorded as a component of cost of natural gas in the consolidated statements of income 
for our derivative financial instruments related to interest rates that do not qualify for hedge accounting  the change in fair market value is recorded as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
our formal hedging program provides a control structure and governance for our hedging activities specific to identified risks and time periods  which are subject to the approval and monitoring by the board of directors of enbridge management or a committee of senior management of our general partner 
we employ derivative financial instruments in connection with an underlying asset  liability or anticipated transaction and we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting treatment that we use are cash flow hedges 
we enter into cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions 
price assumptions we use to value the cash flow and fair value hedges can affect net income for each period 
we use published market price information where available  or quotations from over the counter otc market makers to find executable bids and offers 
the valuations also reflect the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions  including credit risk of our counterparties 
the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements change quarterly as these valuations are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at inception  we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item  the risk management objectives  and the methods used for assessing and testing correlation and hedge effectiveness 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or the fair value of the hedged item 
furthermore  we regularly assess the creditworthiness of our counterparties to manage against the risk of default 
if we determine that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively by including changes in the fair value of the derivative in current earnings 
we record the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments designated and qualifying as effective cash flow hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in fair market value is recognized immediately in earnings 
we determine the change in fair market value of financial instruments designated and qualifying as fair value hedges each period which we record in earnings 
in addition  we calculate the change in the fair market value of the hedged item which is also recorded in earnings 
to the extent that the two valuations offset  the hedge is effective and net earnings is not affected 
our earnings are also affected by use of the mark to market method of accounting as required under gaap for derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
we use derivative financial instruments such as basis swaps and other similar derivative financial instruments to economically hedge market price risks associated with inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions 
however  these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance  and as a result we record changes in fair value of these instruments on the balance sheet and through earnings ie  using the mark to market method rather than deferring them until the firm commitment or anticipated transactions affect earnings 
the use of mark to market accounting for financial instruments can cause non cash earnings volatility due to changes in the underlying indices  primarily commodity prices

index to financial statements commitments  contingencies and environmental liabilities we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to past or current operations 
we expense amounts we incur for remediation of existing environmental contamination caused by past operations that do not benefit future periods by preventing or eliminating future contamination 
we record liabilities for environmental matters when assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other factors 
these amounts also consider prior experience in remediating contaminated sites  other companies clean up experience and data released by government organizations 
our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information and are included in accounts payable and other and other long term liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position at their undiscounted amounts 
we evaluate recoveries from insurance coverage separately from the liability and  when recovery is probable  we record and report an asset separately from the associated liability in our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize liabilities for other commitments and contingencies when  after fully analyzing the available information  we determine it is either probable that an asset has been impaired  or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a range of probable loss can be estimated  we accrue the most likely amount  or if no amount is more likely than another  the minimum of the range of probable loss 
we typically expense legal costs associated with loss contingencies as such costs are incurred

qualitative factors hedge accounting we record all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair market value  which we adjust each period for changes in the fair market value  which we refer to as marking to market  or mark to market 
the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay to transfer a liability or receive to sell an asset in an orderly transaction with market participants  to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date  taking into account the current unrealized losses or gains on open contracts 
we use actively traded external market quotes and indices to value substantially all of the derivative financial instruments we utilize 
in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance  if a derivative financial instrument does not qualify as a hedge  or is not designated as a hedge  the derivative is marked to market each period with the increases and decreases in fair market value recorded in our consolidated statements of income as increases and decreases in cost of natural gas for our commodity based derivatives and interest expense for our interest rate derivatives 
cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual derivative contract is settled by making or receiving a payment to or from the counterparty or by making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative contract 
typically  we settle our derivative contracts when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs 
if a derivative financial instrument qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge  which is a hedge of a forecasted transaction or future cash flows  any unrealized mark to market gain or loss is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income  also referred to as aoci  a component of partners capital  until the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
to the extent that the hedge instrument is effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the income statement 
at inception and on a quarterly basis  we formally assess whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in fair market value is recognized each period in earnings 
realized gains and losses on derivative financial 
table of contents 
index to financial statements instruments that are designated as hedges and qualify for hedge accounting are included in cost of natural gas for commodity hedges and interest expense for interest rate hedges in the period in which the hedged transaction occurs 
gains and losses deferred in aoci related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain in aoci until the underlying physical transaction occurs unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
generally  our preference is for our derivative financial instruments to receive hedge accounting treatment whenever possible to mitigate the non cash earnings volatility that arises from recording the changes in fair value of our derivative financial instruments through earnings 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment as set forth in the authoritative accounting guidance  very specific requirements must be met in terms of hedge structure  hedge objective and hedge documentation 
if a derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as a hedge of the change in fair market value of an underlying asset or liability  the gain or loss resulting from the change in fair market value of the derivative financial instrument is recorded in earnings and is adjusted by the gain or loss resulting from the change in fair market value of the underlying asset or liability 
any ineffective portion of a fair value hedge s change in fair market value is recorded in earnings as the amount that is not offset by the gain or loss on the change in fair market value of the underlying asset or liability 
although we do not presently hold any derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges  in the past we have designated derivatives as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt in periods of high interest rates to achieve effectively lower variable rates 
we include the gains and losses associated with derivative financial instruments designated and qualifying as fair value hedges of our debt obligations in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income 
similar to derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to qualify as a fair value hedge very specific requirements must be met in terms of hedge structure  hedge objective and hedge documentation 
non qualified hedges many of our derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment as set forth in the authoritative accounting guidance 
however  we have transaction types associated with our commodity and interest rate derivative financial instruments where the hedge structure does not meet the requirements to apply hedge accounting 
as a result  these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting and are referred to as non qualified 
these non qualified derivative financial instruments are marked to market each period with the change in fair value  representing unrealized gains and losses  included in cost of natural gas or interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
these mark to market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility that can often be significant from period to period  but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices 
the cash flow impact occurs when the underlying physical transaction takes place in the future and the associated financial instrument contract settlement is made 
the following transaction types do not qualify for hedge accounting and contribute to the volatility of our income and cash flows commodity price exposures transportation in our marketing segment  when we transport natural gas from one location to another  the pricing index used for natural gas sales is usually different from the pricing index used for natural gas purchases  which exposes us to market price risk relative to changes in those two indices 
by entering into a basis swap  where we exchange one pricing index for another  we can effectively lock in the margin  representing the difference between the sales price and the purchase price  on the combined natural gas purchase and natural gas sale  removing any market price risk on the physical transactions 
although this represents a sound economic hedging strategy  the derivative financial instruments ie  the basis swaps we use to manage the commodity price risk associated with these transportation contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  since only the future margin has been fixed and not the future cash flow 
as a result  the changes in fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in earnings 
storage in our marketing segment  we use derivative financial instruments ie  natural gas swaps to hedge the relative difference between the injection price paid to purchase and store natural gas and the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements withdrawal price at which the natural gas is sold from storage 
the intent of these derivative financial instruments is to lock in the margin  representing the difference between the price paid for the natural gas injected and the price received upon withdrawal of the gas from storage in a future period 
we do not pursue cash flow hedge accounting treatment for these storage transactions since the underlying forecasted injection or withdrawal of natural gas may not occur in the period as originally forecast 
this can occur because we have the flexibility to make changes in the underlying injection or withdrawal schedule  based on changes in market conditions 
in addition  since the physical natural gas is recorded at the lower of cost or market  timing differences can result when the derivative financial instrument is settled in a period that is different from the period the physical natural gas is sold from storage 
as a result  derivative financial instruments associated with our natural gas storage activities can create volatility in our earnings 
natural gas collars in our natural gas segment  we had previously entered into natural gas collars to hedge the sales price of natural gas 
the natural gas collars were based on a nymex price  while the physical gas sales were based on a different index 
to better align the index of the natural gas collars with the index of the underlying sales  we de designated the original cash flow hedging relationship with the intent of contemporaneously re designating the natural gas collars as hedges of forecasted physical natural gas sales with a nymex pricing index 
however  because the fair value of these derivative instruments was a liability to us at re designation  they are considered net written options and  pursuant to the authoritative accounting guidance  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these derivatives are being marked to market  with the changes in fair value from the date of de designation recorded to earnings each period 
as a result  our operating income will be subject to greater volatility due to movements in the prices of natural gas until the underlying long term transactions are settled 
optional natural gas processing volumes in our natural gas segment  we use derivative financial instruments to hedge the volumes of ngls produced from our natural gas processing facilities 
our natural gas contracts allow us the option of processing natural gas when it is economical and ceasing to do so when processing becomes uneconomic 
we have entered into derivative financial instruments to fix the sales price of a portion of the ngls that we produce at our discretion and to fix the associated purchases of natural gas required for processing 
we will typically designate derivative financial instruments associated with ngls we produce at our discretion as cash flow hedges when the processing of natural gas is probable of occurrence 
however  we are precluded from designating the derivative financial instruments entered to manage the respective commodity price risk when we are unable to accurately forecast the ngls to be processed at our discretion 
as a result  our operating income will be subject to increased volatility due to fluctuations in ngl prices until the underlying transactions are settled or offset 
forward contracts in our natural gas segment  we use forward contracts to fix the price of ngls we purchase and store in inventory and to fix the price of ngls that we sell from inventory to meet the demands of our customers that sell and purchase ngls 
prior to april   forward contracts were not treated as derivative financial instruments pursuant to the normal purchase normal sale  or npns  exception allowed under authoritative accounting guidance  since the forward contracts resulted in physical receipt or delivery of ngls 
however  evolving markets for ngls have increased opportunities for a portion of our forward contracts to be settled net rather than physically receiving or delivering the ngls 
accordingly  we have revoked the npns exception on certain forward contracts associated with the liquids marketing operations of dufour petroleum  lp  our wholly owned subsidiary  executed after april  the forward contracts for which we have revoked the npns election do not qualify for hedge accounting and are being marked to market each period with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
as a result  our operating income will be subject to additional volatility associated with fluctuations in ngl prices until the forward contracts are settled 
interest rate risk exposures interest rate caps at the corporate level  our earnings and cash flows are affected by fluctuations in interest rates associated with our variable interest rate debt 
our variable interest rate borrowing cost is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements determined at the time of each borrowing or interest rate reset based upon a posted libor for the period of borrowing or interest rate reset  increased by a defined credit spread 
in order to mitigate the negative effect that increasing interest rates can have on our cash flows  we have entered into interest rate caps  which establish a ceiling averaging approximately on the interest rates we pay on up to million of our variable rate indebtedness 
although our interest rate caps protect us from the adverse effect of higher interest rates  they do not qualify for hedge accounting and  as a result  changes in the market value of these instruments will create additional volatility in our earnings 
in all instances related to the commodity price exposures described above  the underlying physical purchase  storage and sale of natural gas and ngls are accounted for on a historical cost or market basis rather than on the mark to market basis we employ for the derivative financial instruments we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage and transportation assets 
this difference in accounting ie  the derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair market value while the physical transactions are recorded at historical cost can and has resulted in volatility in our reported net income  even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated 
the following table presents the unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of our derivatives  which are recorded as an element of cost of natural gas and interest expense in our consolidated statements of income and disclosed as a reconciling item on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  in millions natural gas segment hedge ineffectiveness non qualified hedges marketing non qualified hedges commodity derivative fair value gains losses corporate non qualified interest rate hedges derivative fair value gains losses derivative positions our derivative financial instruments are included at their fair values in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows december  in millions other current assets other assets  net accounts payable and other other long term liabilities the changes in the net assets and liabilities associated with our derivatives are primarily attributable to the effects of new derivative transactions we have entered at prevailing market prices  settlement of maturing derivatives that were in gain positions and the change in forward market prices of our remaining hedges 
our portfolio of derivative financial instruments is largely comprised of long term natural gas and ngl sales and purchase agreements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we record the change in fair value of our highly effective cash flow hedges in aoci until the derivative financial instruments are settled  at which time they are reclassified to earnings 
also included in aoci are unrecognized losses of approximately million associated with derivative financial instruments that qualified for and were classified as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions that were subsequently de designated 
these losses are reclassified to earnings over the periods during which the originally hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
for the years ended december   and  we reclassified from aoci to cost of natural gas on our consolidated statements of income net gains of million and net losses of million and million  respectively 
additionally  for the year ended december   we reclassified from aoci to interest expense on our consolidated statement of income net losses of million 
we estimate that approximately million  representing unrealized net losses from our cash flow hedging activities based on pricing and positions at december   will be reclassified from aoci to earnings during the next twelve months 
as of december   we have provided letters of credit totaling million in lieu of providing cash collateral to our counterparties pursuant to the terms of our international securities dealers association isda agreements 
counterparty credit risk the table below summarizes our derivative balances by counterparty credit quality negative amounts represent our net obligations to pay the counterparty 
december  in millions counterparty credit quality aaa aa a lower than a credit valuation adjustment total as determined by nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations 
as the net receivable of our derivative financial instruments has decreased in response to changes in forward commodity prices  our outstanding financial exposure to third parties has also declined 
when credit thresholds are met pursuant to the terms of our isda financial contracts  we have the right to require collateral from our counterparties 
we have included any cash collateral received in the balances listed above 
when we are in a position of posting collateral to cover our counterparties exposure to our non performance  the collateral is provided through letters of credit  which are not reflected above 
the isda agreements and associated credit support  which govern our financial derivative transactions  contain no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our outstanding transactions 
a change in ratings is not an event of default under these instruments  and the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to transacting under the isda agreements 
in the event of a credit downgrade  additional collateral may be required to be posted under the agreement if we are in a liability position to our counterparty  but the agreement will not automatically terminate or require immediate settlement of amounts due 
the isda agreements  in combination with our master netting agreements  and credit arrangements governing our interest rate and commodity swaps require that collateral be posted per tiered contractual 
table of contents 
index to financial statements thresholds based on each counterparty s credit rating 
we generally provide letters of credit to satisfy such collateral requirements under our isda agreements 
these agreements will require additional collateral postings of up to on net liability positions in the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade  but the agreements do not contain additional triggers or automatic termination clauses relating to credit downgrades 
automatic termination clauses which exist are related only to non performance activities  such as the refusal to post collateral when contractually required to do so 
when we are holding an asset position  our counterparties are likewise required to post collateral on their liability our asset exposures  also determined by the tiered contractual collateral thresholds 
counterparty collateral may consist of cash or letters of credit  both of which must be fulfilled with immediately available funds 
at december   we were in an overall net liability position of million  which included assets of million 
based on our forward positions at december   if our credit ratings were downgraded to bbb by s p or baa by moody s  we would be required to provide million in the form of either cash collateral or letters of credit to satisfy the requirements of our isda agreements 
counterparties to our derivative financial instruments include credit concentrations with us financial institutions  international financial institutions  investment banking entities and  to a lesser extent  international integrated oil companies 
at december   approximately million of our liabilities for derivative financial instruments were due from us to us financial institutions  including investment banks 
we are in net liability positions of million and million with non us financial institutions and small non integrated energy companies  respectively  representing amounts payable by us 
we also have approximately million of receivables that are payable to us from integrated oil companies 
we are holding no cash collateral on our asset exposures and we have provided letters of credit totaling million relating to our liability exposure pursuant to the margin thresholds in effect at december  under our isda agreements
