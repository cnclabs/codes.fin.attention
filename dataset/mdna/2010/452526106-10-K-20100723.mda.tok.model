item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
refer to forward looking statements following the index and item a risk factors of this form k 
overview our business we develop  manufacture and sell a complete line of reagents and automated systems used primarily by donor centers  hospitals and reference laboratories for testing to detect and identify certain properties of human blood for the purpose of blood transfusion 
we have manufacturing facilities in the united states us and canada and sell our products through our direct sales network in the us  canada  western europe and japan as well as through third party distributors in other markets 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to continuing compliance with multiple country specific statutes  regulations and standards 
for example  in the us the food and drug administration fda regulates all aspects of the blood banking industry  including the marketing of reagents and instruments used to detect and identify blood properties 
additionally  we are subject to government legislation that governs the delivery of healthcare 
for example  in the us the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law in march and contains elements that could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered in the us included in the legislation is a excise tax on medical device makers beginning in in the markets of western europe  the testing of donor and patient blood for the purpose of transfusion is primarily automated 
however  in the us  we estimate approximately of laboratories perform this testing manually today 
these laboratories are primarily in the small to medium sized hospital segment 
our strategy is to drive automation in the blood bank with the goal of improving operations as well as patient safety 
we have introduced several serology instruments in the past  and we continue to focus on developing new instruments and improving our existing instruments 
in late fiscal  we began the worldwide introduction of our fourth generation automated instrument  neo 
targeted at large hospitals  donor centers and reference laboratories  neo replaces our previous high volume instrument  galileo  and due to added functionality  we believe neo is a more attractive instrument for the hospital market 
neo delivers the market s highest type and screen throughput and broadest test menu as well as new stat priority functionality for improved workflow 
launched worldwide in  echo  our third generation automated instrument  is a compact bench top  fully automated walk away serology instrument that meets the needs of the small to medium sized hospital market as well as integrated delivery networks that want to standardize the operations of their laboratories 
echo offers an extensive test menu and significant labor reduction while increasing productivity and patient safety 
both our high and lower volume serology instruments use capture technology  our proprietary reagents  as well as certain traditional reagents to perform the automated testing 
in fiscal  we entered the field of molecular immunohematology  which is the dna analysis of blood for the purpose of transfusion  with our purchase of bioarray solutions 
bioarray acquisition on august   we acquired bioarray solutions ltd 
bioarray  a privately held company based in warren  new jersey for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash  including approximately million of acquisition related transaction costs 
we have included the financial results of bioarray in our consolidated financial statements beginning august  bioarray pioneered the development of molecular diagnostic systems that enable the dna typing genotyping of blood for transfusion donors and recipients 
in this transaction  we acquired the broad intellectual property portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications that bioarray generated through its substantial investments in research and development 
through the development of technologies supported by the patents  bioarray developed a novel and flexible technology platform that allows for a variety of dna based testing 
the platform combines semiconductor technology  microparticle chemistry and molecular biology to bring a high degree of flexibility and performance to qualitative and quantitative dna and protein analysis 
using this technology platform  bioarray offers complete assay solutions called the beadchip system 
the beadchip system includes beadchips featuring proprietary array designs as well as a semi automated instrument the array imaging system and basis that reads and interprets test results 
the ensuing integrated assay delivery system enables users to simultaneously perform dozens of customized tests on each patient sample in a semi automated fashion 
we believe this versatility makes the beadchip format ideally suited to a wide scope of applications 
the beadchip system is currently installed in a number of leading donor and transfusion centers worldwide 
in late fiscal  we received ce conformit europ enne mark approval for the human platelet antigen hpa product as well as our current instrument 
in june  after our fiscal year end  we received ce mark approval for our human erythrocyte antigen hea product 
the beadchip system is currently available for research use only in the us we believe that molecular immunohematology  or the dna analysis of blood for the purpose of transfusions  will revolutionize transfusion medicine 
we believe that our acquisition of bioarray provides new  strategic growth markets for the company in both our current market of transfusion through an offering complementary to our current serology product offerings as well as potential new markets 
our leadership in blood banking industry automation and bioarray s leadership in molecular diagnostic systems for specialty transfusion applications should allow us to develop and deliver more precise molecular immunohematology solutions to enhance patient outcomes 
we also believe our proven strength in developing automated instruments combined with our fda licensing and ce mark process experience  our established distribution network  our sales and marketing capabilities as well as our financial resources will generate enhanced long term growth opportunities for the commercialization of bioarray s beadchip system 
we are currently working on the next generation molecular immunohematology instrument that we believe will facilitate the further commercialization of this innovative technology 
our current plan is to have a research use only instrument available in the first half of calendar recent developments a significant recent development is the work on our next generation automated instrument to allow the full scale commercialization of our molecular immunohematology offering  which is discussed above under bioarray acquisition 
the following discusses other recent developments in our business 
worldwide launch of neo in late fiscal  we began the worldwide introduction of our fourth generation automated instrument for serology testing  neo  which replaces our current high volume instrument  galileo 
we believe galileo  which was launched in western europe in and in the us in  has reached its natural replacement cycle of five to seven years 
like galileo  neo is targeted at high volume customers large hospitals  donor centers and reference laboratories 
we believe neo will have broader market appeal in the hospital segment than galileo due to added functionality and faster turnaround times 
during february  neo received ce mark approval in the european union and in april neo received fda clearance in the us continued market penetration of the echo instrument we launched our third generation automated instrument for serology testing  echo  in the first quarter of fiscal echo features stat functionality  exceptional mean time between failures and what we believe is the fastest turnaround time in the industry 
echo is targeted at small to medium sized hospitals  the largest segment of our market  as well as at integrated delivery networks  in combination with neo  to facilitate standardization across facilities 
fda administrative action in june  we announced that the fda  in an administrative action based on a january inspection  issued a notice of intent to revoke our biologics license with respect to our reagent red blood cells and anti e monoclonal blood grouping reagent products 
under this administrative action  we have the opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance before the fda initiates revocation proceedings or takes other action 
the fda did not order the recall of any of our products or restrict us from selling these products 
this administrative action was a follow on to a warning letter that we had received in may we had been working on an fda approved remediation plan  submitted after the warning letter  but had failed to make adequate progress at the time of the fda s follow up inspection in january in early calendar during our third quarter of fiscal  we formalized efforts to improve our quality systems through the quality process improvement project  which is discussed in further detail below 
in august in response to the june administrative action  we submitted a detailed remediation plan that outlined our actions and timelines to correct the fda s noted deficiencies from the january inspection 
the quality process improvement project served as the basis for the detailed remediation plan 
during our third fiscal quarter of  we completed the remediation portion of the project 
during june  after our fiscal year end  the fda conducted an inspection of our facilities 
we have no update on our compliance status at this time 
quality process improvement project during our third quarter of fiscal  we formalized our efforts to improve the processes and procedures of our quality department through establishing the quality process improvement project 
the project expanded the role of consultants hired in april the project s objective is to both remediate the deficiencies noted by fda and to deliver on our commitment of maintaining a world class quality system 
during fiscal and fiscal  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  on the project 
these costs were reflected in cost of sales and primarily represent the cost of external consultants who were assisting us with the project 
during our third fiscal quarter of  we completed the remediation portion of the project 
the project continues with a focus on establishing a world class quality system 
we will primarily use internal resources on the project going forward 
instruments we continue to focus on increasing market share and  therefore  revenue through our automation strategy  which has instrument placements at its core 
we believe our innovative automation offering is a key competitive advantage we have in the industry 
for markets in which we sell directly to the end user eg  a hospital  the process is as follows we receive the order  we schedule installation of the instrument and customer staff training  the customer performs validation testing of the instrument  which begins generating recurring reagent revenue and the revenue ramps up to its expected annualized run rate once the validation process has been completed 
revenue and expenses related to the sale of instruments is accounted for under fasb accounting standards codificationtm asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc 
asc mandates the deferral of certain revenue for sales agreements that have multiple deliverables while also mandating the upfront expensing of the related costs 
the reagent contracts that are signed when customers automate typically have reagent price guarantee clauses 
when instruments are sold versus rented the instrument costs are expensed when the sale is made and the related instrument revenue is deferred and recorded as income over the term of the underlying reagent contract 
if an instrument is rented  then the revenue and expenses are recognized ratably over the contract period 
while the overall transaction economics may be similar  this accounting treatment may result in margin improvement or degradation depending on the sales mix of instruments purchased or rented by customers in the period 
for echo  in fiscal  we experienced a rental rate of more than for new instrument orders in the us historically  our high volume instrument  galileo  was purchased of the time in the us market 
as of may  and  we had deferred revenue of approximately million and million  respectively  and a major portion of these balances related to the deferral of revenue from sales of instruments 
results of operations comparison of years ended may  and may  for the year ended may  change amount in thousands net sales gross profit gross profit percentage operating expenses income from operations non operating income expense income before income tax provision for income tax net income earnings per share per common share basic per common share diluted the determination of gross margin is exclusive of amortization expense which is presented separately as an operating expense in the statements of income 
revenue increased by approximately million  or approximately  during the year ended may  compared with the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to approximately million from price contributions  which included incremental revenue from both contractual and discretionary sources  and approximately million from volume contributions  which included incremental revenue primarily from instrument placements 
revenue also benefited by approximately million in fiscal from foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately of our fiscal consolidated revenue is from the us and approximately is from international sales largely denominated in local currency 
our significant currencies besides the us dollar are the euro  the canadian dollar  the british pound and the japanese yen 
as a result  our consolidated revenue expressed in dollars benefits when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens in relation to other currencies 
for fiscal  our consolidated gross margin decreased to from achieved in fiscal  primarily due to expenses related to our quality process improvement project  which were reflected in cost of sales 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million on our quality process improvement project compared with approximately million spent in fiscal operating expenses increased approximately  primarily due to our acquisition of bioarray which closed on august   increased legal expenses and increased research and development expenses related to various projects  including our next generation instrument for molecular immunohematology 
net income increased approximately in fiscal over the prior year 
in fiscal  we received orders for our high volume instruments  galileo and neo  including in the rest of the world  including distributors  and in the us and canada 
in fiscal  we received orders for our echo instrument  including in the rest of the world  including distributors  and in the us and canada 
as of may   we had an instrument backlog of galileo neos and echos 
net sales for the year ended may  change amount in thousands traditional reagents capture reagents instruments molecular immunohematology traditional reagent revenue increased by approximately million  or approximately  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to price contributions  which included incremental revenue from both contractual and discretionary sources 
traditional reagent sales  which accounted for approximately of total revenue in fiscal  have historically been a significant portion of our revenue 
our revenue mix is changing over time as we place more instruments in the market  which results in increased sales of our capture reagents 
capture revenue increased by approximately million  or approximately  in fiscal over the prior year primarily due to increased volume 
sales of capture reagents are largely dependent on the number of installed instruments requiring the use of our proprietary capture technology 
as we continue to place more instruments in the market  we expect revenue from capture reagents to continue to increase 
revenue from instruments increased by approximately million  or approximately in fiscal compared with the prior year due to increased instrument placements 
instrument revenue is typically recognized over the life of either the instrument rental period or the underlying reagent contract period 
historically  when instruments are sold versus rented revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the underlying reagent contract period when the contract includes a price guarantee which our contracts typically do 
in fiscal  approximately million of deferred revenue was recognized from previous instrument sales compared with million recognized in fiscal in fiscal  we deferred approximately million of instrument and associated service revenues related to instrument sales compared with million in the prior year 
as of may  and  deferred instrument and service revenues on the balance sheet totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
over the past three years  the proportion of instruments rented versus sold has increased 
therefore  our deferred revenue balance has declined 
molecular immunohematology revenue increased by approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to the introduction of our molecular offering outside the us our molecular immunohematology products are a result of our august  bioarray acquisition 
gross margin for the year ended may  change amount margin amount margin amount in in in traditional reagents capture reagents instruments molecular immunohematology the determination of gross margin is exclusive of amortization expense which is presented separately as an operating expense in the statements of income 
gross margins on traditional reagents decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year  primarily due to expenses related to our quality process improvement project 
during the current fiscal year  we spent approximately million on our quality process improvement project compared with approximately million spent in fiscal these costs were primarily reflected in traditional reagent cost of sales 
for fiscal  capture product gross margins decreased to from in the prior year primarily due to the allocation of revenue from capture reagents to instruments related to reagent rentals as well as due to manufacturing variances 
in a reagent rental  the reagent revenue stream is used to fund all components of the customer s acquisition  including the reagents themselves as well as the instrument and instrument related items  such as training 
reagent gross margin is negatively impacted as a portion of reagent revenue is allocated to instruments over the life of the contract but none of the costs associated with the reagents are allocated 
gross margins on instruments increased to in fiscal from in the prior year  primarily due to sales mix 
in the current year  more instruments were rented versus sold compared to the prior year 
an instrument rental results in revenue and expenses related to the instrument being recognized evenly over the contract period 
when we sell an instrument and the sales contract has reagent price guarantees  which our contracts typically do  the instrument costs are expensed upfront and the related instrument revenue is deferred and recognized over the contract period 
current year and prior year margins benefited from the recognition of revenue deferred from prior periods 
in fiscal and fiscal  we recognized million and million  respectively  of deferred revenue related to instrument sales and service 
operating expenses for the year ended may  change amount in thousands research and development selling and marketing distribution general and administrative amortization expense total operating expenses certain prior year operating expenses have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal over the prior year  primarily due to recognizing a full year of bioarray expenses  which was acquired on august   and the development activities for the next generation molecular immunohematology instrument 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to lower compensation expense 
distribution expenses rose by approximately million in fiscal over the prior year  primarily due to increased shipping and packaging costs 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal over the prior year  primarily due to legal expenses related to the department of justice investigation and the related lawsuits 
amortization expense increased by approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to recognizing a full year of amortization of finite lived intangibles that were recorded upon the acquisition of bioarray 
non operating income expense for the year ended may  change amount in thousands non operating income expense the year over year change in non operating income expense was primarily attributable to lower interest income due to a decrease in interest rates 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to increased pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate was in the current year compared with in the prior year 
the tax rate in the current year period was favorably impacted primarily by a settlement with a state taxing authority 
as a result of using compensation cost deductions arising from the exercise of nonqualified employee stock options and vesting of restricted shares for federal and state income tax purposes  we had an income tax shortfall of approximately million in fiscal and we realized income tax benefits of million in fiscal as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  the income tax shortfall and income tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements as a reduction of or an addition to additional paid in capital rather than as an increase or reduction of the respective income tax provisions in the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of years ended may  and may  for the year ended may  change amount in thousands net sales gross profit gross profit percentage operating expenses income from operations non operating income income before income tax provision for income tax net income earnings per share per common share basic per common share diluted the determination of gross margin is exclusive of amortization expense which is presented separately as an operating expense in the income statement 
revenue increased by approximately million  or approximately  during the year ended may  compared with the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to approximately million from price contributions  which included incremental revenue from both contractual and discretionary sources  and approximately million from volume contributions  which included incremental revenue from instrument placements 
these increases were offset by a negative currency impact of approximately million 
approximately of our fiscal consolidated revenue is from the us and is from international sales largely denominated in local currency  with the majority of this revenue in euros  canadian dollars  british pounds and yen 
as a result  our consolidated revenue expressed in dollars benefits when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens in relation to other currencies 
for fiscal  our consolidated gross margin increased to from achieved in fiscal  primarily due to margin improvements in traditional reagents and instruments 
during the current fiscal year  we spent approximately million on our quality process improvement project  which was primarily reflected in cost of sales 
operating expenses increased approximately  primarily due to our acquisition of bioarray 
net income increased approximately in fiscal over the prior year 
net sales for the year ended may  change amount in thousands traditional reagents capture reagents instruments molecular immunohematology collagen traditional reagent revenue increased by approximately million  or approximately  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to price contributions  which included incremental revenue from both contractual and discretionary sources 
traditional reagent sales  which accounted for approximately two thirds of total revenue in fiscal  have historically been a significant portion of our revenue 
we expect our revenue mix to change over time as we place more instruments in the market  which results in increased sales of our capture reagents 
capture revenue increased by approximately million  or approximately  in fiscal over the prior year primarily due to increased volume 
sales of capture reagents are largely dependent on the number of installed instruments requiring the use of our proprietary capture technology 
as we continue to place more instruments in the market  we expect revenue from capture reagents to continue to increase 
revenue from instruments increased by approximately million  or approximately in fiscal compared with fiscal due to increased instrument placements 
historically  revenue from instrument sales in the united states has been recognized over the life of the underlying reagent contract when it includes a price guarantee  which is normally five years 
in fiscal  approximately million of deferred revenue was recognized from previously placed instruments compared to million recognized in fiscal we deferred approximately million of instrument and associated service revenues related to instrument placements in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal we had increased rentals of instruments in the current year  which resulted in revenue being recognized over the term of the contract as earned  versus deferred and amortized as in the case of the instrument being sold 
as of may  and may   deferred instrument and service revenues totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the sale of molecular immunohematology products produced by bioarray resulted in million in revenue during fiscal bioarray was acquired on august  we discontinued manufacturing collagen products in the second quarter of fiscal when our commitment to a third party expired  which resulted in a revenue decrease of million in fiscal gross margin for the year ended may  change amount margin amount margin amount in in in traditional reagents capture reagents instruments molecular immunohematology collagen the determination of gross margin is exclusive of amortization expense which is presented separately as an operating expense in the income statement 
gross margins on traditional reagents increased to in fiscal from in the prior year  primarily due to higher revenue without a proportionate increase in cost of sales 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million on our quality process improvement project 
these costs were primarily reflected in traditional reagent cost of sales 
for fiscal  capture product gross margins decreased to from in the prior year primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations and product sales mix 
gross margins on instruments increased to in fiscal from in the prior year  primarily due to sales mix 
in the prior year  more instruments were sold and in the current year more instruments were rented 
where sales contracts have reagent price guarantee clauses which our automation contracts typically do  instrument costs are expensed when the sale is made  but the related instrument revenue is deferred and recorded as income over the term of the contract 
when an instrument is rented  revenue and expenses for the transaction are recognized evenly over the life of the contract 
additionally  current year margins benefited from the recognition of revenue deferred from prior periods 
in fiscal  we recognized million more deferred revenue than in the prior year 
operating expenses for the year ended may  change amount in thousands research and development selling and marketing distribution general and administrative restructuring expense amortization expense total operating expenses certain prior year operating expenses have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal over the prior year  primarily due to the acquisition of bioarray  which took place in the first quarter of this fiscal year  and the development activities around the acquired molecular immunohematology offering 
selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to the addition of new affiliates in france and the united kingdom  and the bioarray acquisition 
distribution expenses rose by approximately million in fiscal over the prior year  primarily due to an increase in freight charges and other general expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal over the prior year  primarily due to the addition of bioarray and our affiliates in the united kingdom and france 
amortization expense increased by approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal due to amortization of finite lived intangibles that were recorded upon the acquisition of bioarray and our affiliate in the united kingdom 
both acquisitions occurred in the first quarter of this fiscal year 
non operating income for the year ended may  change amount in thousands non operating income the year over year decrease in non operating income was primarily attributable to lower interest income due to our lower cash balance as well as a decrease in interest rates 
cash on hand was lower in fiscal as a result of the acquisitions made in the first fiscal quarter 
additionally  non operating income was lower as a result of higher foreign exchange losses related to an intercompany receivable 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to increased pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate was in the current year compared with in the prior year 
the tax rates in the current year periods were favorably impacted primarily by an increase in research and development credits following the bioarray acquisition and lower statutory rates in italy 
as a result of using compensation cost deductions arising from the exercise of nonqualified employee stock options and vesting of restricted shares for federal and state income tax purposes  we realized income tax benefits of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the majority of the exercises that contribute to the tax benefit are exercises of options that were granted prior to the adoption of asc compensation stock compensation asc 
therefore  as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  these income tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements as additions to additional paid in capital rather than as reductions of the respective income tax provisions in the consolidated financial statements because the related compensation deductions were not recognized as compensation expense for financial reporting purposes 
our income tax liability is reduced by these amounts 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow 
this cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating  investing and financing needs 
we have adequate working capital and sources of capital to operate our current business and to meet our existing capital requirements 
at may   we had working capital of million  compared to million of working capital at may  the following table shows the cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing and financing activities for fiscal years  and  as well as the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents for those same years for the year ended may  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents were million as of may   as compared to million as of may  the increase in our cash position resulted from operating cash flow in the current year 
operating activities cash flow from operations generally increases proportionately with increases in net income 
in fiscal  net cash generated by operating activities was million compared with million in fiscal the year over year increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to the million year over year increase in net income 
in fiscal  net cash generated by operating activities was million compared with million in fiscal the year over year increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to the million year over year increase in net income 
investing activities generally  the primary use of cash for investing activities is related to the purchase of property and equipment 
however  in fiscal  we used a significant amount of cash for acquisitions 
in fiscal  million of net cash was used in investing activities compared with million of cash used in the fiscal cash used in investing activities in the current year related to the purchase of property and equipment 
in the prior year  we paid million for the acquisition of bioarray and our uk distributor as well as million for the purchase of property and equipment 
for fiscal  million of net cash was used in investing activities compared with million of cash used in the fiscal we paid million for the acquisition of bioarray and our uk distributor in fiscal for the purchase of property and equipment  we spent million in the fiscal compared with million spent in fiscal financing activities for financing activities  the typical use of cash is for the repurchase of our common stock and the typical cash proceeds relates to the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal  compared with million in the prior year 
during fiscal  we used million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
also reflected in repurchase of common stock in the cash flow statement is approximately million in withholding taxes we paid 
this payment was in compliance with statutory tax withholding requirements for the exercise of options and vesting of restricted shares in exchange for surrender of the company s shares of equal value 
during fiscal  we received million cash from the exercise of employee stock options compared with million in the same period of the prior year 
for fiscal we had a tax shortfall of million and in fiscal we had a tax benefit of million from the exercise of nonqualified employee stock options 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million compared with net cash generated by financing activities of million in the prior year 
during fiscal  we used million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
also reflected in repurchase of common stock in the cash flow statement is approximately million in withholding taxes we paid 
this payment was in compliance with statutory tax withholding requirements for the exercise of options and vesting of restricted shares in exchange for surrender of the company s shares of equal value 
we received million and million from the exercise of employee stock options in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal and fiscal  we received million and million  respectively  of excess tax benefits from share based compensation 
stock repurchase program the company instituted a stock repurchase program in june in august  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase an additional  shares of the company s common stock under this repurchase program  bringing the total authorized shares to during fiscal  approximately  shares were repurchased in the open market under the repurchase plan for approximately million 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares in the open market for approximately million 
we made no share repurchases during fiscal shares that are repurchased by the company are returned to the status of authorized but unissued 
as of may    shares had been repurchased under the program  leaving  shares available for repurchase 
the company s stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims and other issues asserted in such matters  however  there can be no assurance that such matters or any future legal matters will not have an adverse effect on the company or our financial position 
contingent liabilities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
future cash requirements and restrictions we expect that cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we expect to continue to generate net positive cash flow 
in the longer term  we will be able to use a portion of the acquired net operating loss tax carry forwards from the bioarray acquisition  subject to certain conditions and limitations  which will positively impact cash flows 
we have normal maintenance capital expenditure requirements that we plan to fund through operating cash flow 
additionally  we internally finance the rental agreements for our instruments and also plan to fund this activity through operating cash flows 
there are no restrictions on our subsidiaries with respect to sending dividends  or making loans or advances to immucor 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations and commercial commitments  primarily for the next five years  are detailed in the table below contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to the obligations in the table above  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above  we have also recorded a liability for interest of million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet financial arrangements as of may  critical accounting policies and estimates general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and certain assumptions could prove to be incorrect 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following i 
revenue recognition ii 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts iii 
inventories iv 
goodwill v 
taxation vi 
stock based compensation i revenue recognition in accordance with asc  revenue recognition asc  we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services are rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
reagent sales revenue from the sale of our reagents to end users is primarily recognized upon shipment when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  unless there are specific contractual terms to the contrary 
revenue from the sale of our reagents to distributors is recognized fob customs clearance when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
instrument sales contracts for the sale or rental of our instruments typically have multiple deliverables 
in such cases  we recognize revenue on the sale of instruments in accordance with asc our instrument sales contracts with multiple deliverables include the sale or rental of an instrument including delivery  installation and training  the servicing of the instrument during the first year  and  in many cases  price guarantees for reagents and consumables purchased during the contract period 
we have determined the fair value of certain of these elements  such as training and first year service 
we do not believe it is possible to determine the fair value of price guarantees at the time of the sale 
if the contract contains price guarantees  which our contracts typically do  the entire arrangement consideration is deferred and recognized over the related guarantee period 
for contracts without price guarantees  the sales price in excess of the fair values of training and service is allocated to the instrument itself and recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations relating to training and or installation 
the fair value of a training session is recognized as revenue when services are provided 
the fair value of first year service is recognized over the first year of the contract 
the allocation of the total consideration  which is based on the estimated fair value of the units of accounting  requires judgment by management 
in revenue deferral situations  the costs related to the instruments are recognized when the instrument is installed and accepted by the customer 
revenue from the sale of our instruments without multiple deliverables is generally recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations 
revenue from rentals of our instruments is recognized over the term of the rental agreement 
instrument service contract revenue is recognized over the term of the service contract 
ii trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables at may  and may   totaling million and million  respectively  are net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their debts 
the collectibility of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
if it is determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered 
iii inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market net realizable value 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company also allocates certain production related general and administrative costs to inventory and incurred approximately million  million and million of such costs in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company had approximately million and million of general and administrative costs remaining in inventory as of may  and may   respectively 
we use a standard cost system as a tool to monitor production efficiency 
the standard cost system applies estimated labor and manufacturing overhead factors to inventory based on budgeted production and efficiency levels  staffing levels and costs of operation  based on the experience and judgment of management 
actual costs and production levels may vary from the standard established and such variances are charged to the consolidated statement of income as a component of cost of sales 
since us generally accepted accounting principles require that the standard cost approximate actual cost  periodic adjustments are made to the standard rates to approximate actual costs 
no material changes have been made to the inventory policy during fiscal  or iv goodwill consistent with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets that have finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using primarily the income  or discounted cash flows  approach 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed during the year resulted in no impairment charges 
v income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  and we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  carry back opportunities  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we assess the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of income tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
although an update to asc  income taxes asc  which we adopted at the beginning of fiscal  provides further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements  the new threshold and measurement attribute prescribed by the fasb will continue to require significant judgment by management 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations 
vi stock based employee compensation we adopted the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc  on june   using the modified prospective transition method  which requires that i compensation costs be recorded as earned for all unvested stock options outstanding at the beginning of the first fiscal year of adoption based on the grant date fair value  and ii compensation costs for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to the adoption be recorded  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc on adoption  we elected to attribute the value of share based compensation to expense using the straight line method  which was the method previously used for disclosing our required pro forma information 
we elected to estimate the fair value of our share based payment awards using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes model  which was previously used for disclosing our pro forma information 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the black scholes model requires the input of assumptions regarding the expectations of future volatility  term of the grant until exercise  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
we have calculated our additional paid in capital pool apic pool based on the actual income tax benefits received from exercises of stock options granted after the effective date of asc using the long method 
the apic pool is available to absorb any tax deficiencies subsequent to the adoption of asc the adoption of asc s fair value method negatively impacts our results of operations 
the future impact of adoption will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future  expected volatilities and expected useful lives  among other factors  present at the grant date 
recently issued accounting standards adopted by the company in fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

in may  the fasb established asc  subsequent events asc 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
the effective date of asc is interim or annual financial periods ending after june  this codification topic does not apply to subsequent events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable generally accepted accounting principles that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions 
asc applies to both interim financial statements and annual financial statements and should not result in significant changes in the subsequent events that are reported 
asc introduces the concept of financial statements being available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which a company has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  whether that represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
asc should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
the adoption of asc during the first quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
topic was updated by fasb asu further discussion of related accounting treatment is noted below 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu  measuring liabilities at fair value asu  which is an amendment of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asu provides clarification for circumstances where a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
in that situation  entities are required to measure fair value in one or more of the following techniques a valuation technique that uses either a the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  or b the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as an asset 
another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of asc  such as an income approach or a market approach 
asu also clarifies that a reporting entity is not required to adjust the fair value of a liability to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability 
the provisions of this update are effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
the adoptions of the provisions of this update to asc during the second quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  effective immediately  which amended asc the amendments were made to address concerns about conflicts with sec guidance and other practice issues 
among the provisions of the amendment  the fasb defined a new type of entity  termed an sec filer  which is an entity required to file or furnish its financial statements with the sec 
while an sec filer is still required by gaap to evaluate subsequent events through the date its financial statements are issued  it is no longer required to disclose in the financial statements that it has done so or the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the adoption of the provisions of asc during the third quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
not yet adopted by the company in june  the fasb issued an update to asc  consolidation asc 
this update changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on  among other things  the other entity s purpose and design and the reporting entity s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity s economic performance 
this update will require a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
a reporting entity will be required to disclose how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the reporting entity s financial statements 
the update will be effective at the start of a reporting entity s first fiscal year beginning after november   which corresponds to the company s first quarter of fiscal early application is not permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this update to asc to have a material impact on its financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverables revenue arrangements asu  which is an amendment of asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
this update addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to allow the vendor to account for deliverables separately instead of as one combined unit by amending the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  b third party evidence or c best estimate of selling price 
the residual method of allocation has been eliminated and arrangement consideration is now required to be allocated to all deliverables at the inception of the arrangement using the selling price method 
additionally  expanded disclosures will be required relating to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements

in april  the fasb issued asu  effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades asu  which is an amendment of asc  compensation stock compensation 
this update clarifies that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity 
this update will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december   which corresponds to the company s fourth quarter of fiscal early application is permitted 
the company currently accounts for the above mentioned share based payment awards as equity  therefore the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on its financial statements
