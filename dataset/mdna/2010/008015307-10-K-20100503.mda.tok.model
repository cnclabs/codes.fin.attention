management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a is provided to help provide an understanding of our business  financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
our md a is organized as follows overview 
this section contains trend analysis  a summary of the challenges we encountered this fiscal year and steps we are taking to address these challenges 
this section may contain forward looking statements 
these statements are based on our current expectations and actual results may materially differ from such expectations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to vary are those described in this overview section and in item a 
risk factors 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of results of operations for the two fiscal years presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of cash flows  a discussion of outstanding debt  working capital and capital expenditures  and commitments  both firm and contingent  that existed as of january   and trends  demands  events and uncertainties with respect to our ability to finance our continuing operations 
critical accounting policies 
this section discusses the accounting policies i that require us to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
overview the trend in the aerospace industry continues toward digital cockpits as the aerospace industry moves away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was our foundation 
in fiscal year  we made further progress in our ability to design and manufacture digital instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems 
we have maintained and strengthened our commitment to research and development to further enhance our product line as we anticipate continued movement toward digital cockpits in the aerospace industry 
we plan to position ourselves such that we have the ability to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation 
while we believe that this strategy will  over time  strengthen our position in the aerospace industry  we cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful or that we will have access to the capital resources needed to fully support this strategy 
we also have significant business tied to military programs 
as a consequence  our business can fluctuate depending on government spending on military programs for which we supply our products 
while we have been successful in obtaining contracts to supply military needs in recent years  changes in government spending could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our future military business 
while we can not fully predict the outcome of the us government s budget process  we expect that the majority of the military programs we supply will be sustained at current or near current levels 
likewise  changes in the commercial sector of the aerospace industry can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our future business 
while we have historically invested heavily in product development for both funded and unfunded programs  oem requirements may change such that additional product development efforts will be necessary to maintain or increase our revenue in the aerospace industry 
with the recent economic conditions  several of our commercial customers continue to operate with reduced operations and manufacturing 
while this may be offset by additional increases in aftermarket support  it is likely that our business will continue to be negatively affected until the economy recovers and our customers resume prior levels of production and growth 
our fiscal year results of operations  working capital and liquidity were affected by a number of factors including the following difficulties faced by our supplier base  impacting product availability  credit  and or delivery terms  some residual production inefficiencies and direct costs resulting from the interruption of business operations caused by the august  fire  cost incurred in conjunction with the moving of our earlysville  virginia operations to a leased facility in the same area  competition from larger more well capitalized companies  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses primarily related to our earlysville  virginia property held for sale  as well as clean up from the august  fire 
we have commenced and will continue to take steps to address the challenges we encountered in fiscal year among these steps are the following we employed a new chief financial officer  and a new controller in fiscal year  we hired a new vice president for technology and product development in fiscal  while reorganizing and enhancing the engineering team in a year when many other companies were down sizing  we continued to review and find ways to improve our costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses  through active marketing efforts  we are working to sell our earlysville  virginia plant facility  and the operations team began implementing lean manufacturing programs to improve our production throughput and operating efficiencies 
results of operations our senior management regularly reviews the performance of our operations including reviews of key performance metrics and the status of operating initiatives 
we review information on the financial performance of the operations  new business opportunities  customer relationships and initiatives  ir d activities  human resources  manufacturing effectiveness  cost reduction activities  as well as other subjects 
we compare performance against budget  against prior comparable periods and against our most recent internal forecasts 
we believe the overall prospects for our financial performance to be very good 
our backlog remains at high levels while our proposal activity continues to be very active  although somewhat constrained in the commercial business jet market due to the economic conditions 
the financial performance in fiscal year was partly driven by the continued recovery from the effects of the fire at the clearwater facility in august  we also completed the consolidation of the virginia manufacturing operations into the clearwater facility while successfully transitioning the remaining engineering and repair overhaul personnel to our leased facilities in charlottesville  virginia 
also  through focused and deliberate operational improvement efforts  we substantially progressed through past due backlog that was delayed by the lost capacity and lost assets from the august fire 
finally  our selective hiring practices have enabled us to add key talent to several disciplines during the past year  augmented by training programs to facilitate improved team capabilities across the company 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales were  during fiscal year  an increase of  or  when compared to  for fiscal year throughout fiscal year  we made significant progress in transitioning the business after the interruption caused by the august fire 
in that regard  we were successful in stabilizing and improving upon critical manufacturing and planning processes 
gross profit increased from for fiscal year to for fiscal year during fiscal year  the gross profit performance was negatively and significantly impacted by the effects of the fire in august the significant improvements in gross profit performance in fiscal year are due primarily to the increased manufacturing throughput combined with improvements in operational performance 
our continued improvement in gross margin will require the following improving performance in our manufacturing planning and execution processes  planning inventory purchases and movement carefully  finalizing design of new digital products to increase market offerings and reducing costs and inefficiencies in our operations through better resource management and improved accountability 
these initiatives will be complemented with a marketing and sales strategy that addresses the highly competitive and dynamic aircraft business environment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased  or  when compared to fiscal year this decrease was attributable to a non recurrence of separation costs recorded in fiscal year  b a decrease in operating expenses due to the consolidation of the earlysville  virginia operations into clearwater  and c reduced professional services expense including legal  audit  and consulting costs 
interest expense  net increased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the increase was driven by accretion expense on promissory notes entered into in fiscal year the gain from casualty loss for fiscal year of  is attributable to additional insurance proceeds received relating to the august  fire 
the gain from casualty loss in fiscal year included insurance proceeds of  offset by the net book value of inventory and fixed assets destroyed in the fire of  and  respectively 
income tax expense decreased  to a tax benefit of  for fiscal year compared to a tax expense of  for fiscal year this change was due to increased tax expense in fiscal year associated with the significantly increased profitability offset by the reversal of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal year for the year ended january   net income was approximately  or basic and diluted earnings per share  versus a net loss of approximately  or basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended january  the improvement in net income for the full year was driven by the increased sales volume  the improved gross margin performance  and the complete reversal of the  tax valuation allowance that was established in the prior year 
for the year ended january   both the basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal year included approximately and  respectively  which was attributable to the reversal of the tax valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources while net sales improved significantly in fiscal year over fiscal year  liquidity remained a challenge during fiscal year the days sales in accounts receivable unfavorably increased to days at january   up from days at january  this was due in large part to the strained world economy which caused certain customers to lengthen payment cycles 
through careful cash management and purchasing practices  our outstanding balances with production suppliers favorably improved as days purchases in accounts payable decreased to days at january   down from days at january  nevertheless  we continue to be challenged to maintain favorable payment terms with certain suppliers 
in addition  the company continues to deal with residual production issues from the impact of the august  fire 
during fiscal year  we repaid  of the remaining  in customer advances outstanding at january  we have not yet sold the earlysville  virginia facility  although active marketing efforts are continuing 
as a result  the company continues to experience liquidity constraints 
obtaining sufficient liquidity to i satisfy working capital requirements  ii repay customer advances  iii fulfill necessary capital spending and iv meet the company s debt obligations is dependent both on the continued realization of positive cash flows from operations and on obtaining alternative financing sources 
otherwise  the company will consider other alternatives to meet its cash requirements 
cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal year  a decrease in cash used of  when compared to cash used of  for fiscal year this net decrease in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to decreases in cash used in operating activities of  from increased operating net income in fiscal year  after adjustment for non cash items  when compared to operating net income in fiscal year  also after adjustment for non cash items and  from improved inventory management and certain cost reduction efforts in fiscal year when compared to increased inventory purchase levels in fiscal year  primarily offset by increases in cash used in operating activities of  from increases to accounts receivable at january  when compared to january   a period of depressed accounts receivable balances caused by reduced sales as a result of the august fire   from the repayment of customer advances through production efforts of  in fiscal year when compared to the receipt of customer advances of  in fiscal year and  from increased prepayment of expenses and deposits in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year cash used in investing activities increased  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to the purchase of  of capital improvements and equipment in fiscal year when compared to the receipt of proceeds of  received in fiscal year from the company s insurer related to fixed assets lost in the august fire 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was  compared to cash used in financing activities in fiscal year of  the change was attributable to net drawdown in fiscal year of  on our revolving credit facility compared to net repayments in fiscal year of  further  proceeds from the investors notes of  was recognized in fiscal year our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity in fiscal year and beyond continues to be highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results 
failure to successfully achieve these results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations in the future  and could require implementation of curative measures  including raising capital  deferring planned capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending  and or  if necessary  selling assets 
credit facilities our credit facilities are with wachovia bank in the amount of  which includes  and  term notes and a  revolving credit facility 
the two promissory notes as follows i a renewal and future advance promissory note in the amount of  the future advance note  and ii a renewal and amended term promissory note in the amount of  the term note and together with the future advance note  the notes 
the future advance note is collateralized by our real estate in clearwater  florida 
the term note is collateralized by our real estate in earlysville  virginia 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by the company s assets  with the exception of the company s real estate located in earlysville  virginia and clearwater  florida 
the notes will mature on i with respect to the future advance note  september   and ii with respect to the term note  june  the interest rate on the revolving credit facility as well as on the notes is one month libor which was and at january   and january   respectively plus basis points 
interest  when applicable  is to be paid monthly on the revolving credit facility 
interest and principal are paid monthly on the notes 
at january   there was  of available funds to be drawn on the revolving credit facility 
our long term debt agreements with wachovia contain certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including the requirement to maintain i at all times  a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth that does not exceed to  and ii at the end of each fiscal quarter  a cash flow coverage ratio with regard to the debt service of at least to 
as of january  and we were not in compliance with the cash flow coverage ratio covenant and the total liabilities to tangible net worth covenant  however  wachovia has provided a written waiver of the non compliance to us through june  consequently  the entire amount of long term debt is classified as a current maturity at both january  and the other restrictive covenants  among other things  require us to obtain consent from the lender prior to making a material change of management  guarantee or otherwise become responsible for obligations of any other person or entity or assuming or becoming liable for any debt  contingent or direct  in excess of  on may   the company entered into three separate unsecured loans with three separate private investors  bruce j 
stone  redmond family investments  lllp and martin l 
schaffel  herein referred to as the investors  each containing a drawdown provision allowing the company to borrow up to an aggregate of  the loan agreements provide for the issuance of warrants with an exercise price of per warrant issued at the rate of one warrant for every four dollars loaned to the company and common shares at the rate of one share for every ten dollars loaned to the company 
additionally  any amounts borrowed are subject to interest per annum  payable monthly 
on may   the company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of  based upon the cash drawdown provision of each of the three unsecured loan agreements related to the investors 
the  warrants issued to the investors pursuant to the  drawdown are exercisable at any time during the period after may  and before the warrant expiration date of april  the company s  common shares issued in connection with the  cash drawdown were not registered under the securities act of and therefore  are restricted securities as that term is defined in rule under the securities act 
the aggregate amount borrowed of  is payable in full under each of the three notes on or before april  on february   the loans were modified  among other conditions  to extend the term of the unsecured loans to april  the warrants and common shares are recorded as a separate component of interest and are being accreted into the loan balance over the term of the loan 
for the year ended january   the company recognized accretion of  presented as additional interest expense 
working capital and capital expenditures our working capital deficit at january  was  compared to  at january  the increase in working capital during fiscal year related to an increase in sales and accounts receivable as well as increases to prepaid and other current assets and the repayment of customer advances 
these favorable working capital variances are offset in part by unfavorable working capital variances associated with increases to the line of credit and the drawdown of additional debt from the investors notes payable 
credit terms provided customers are consistent with those normally offered in our industry 
future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including research and development  expansion of product lines and other factors 
furthermore  we may need to develop and introduce new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments  which would require additional resources 
currently  our constrained cash flow from operations prohibits us from meeting these challenges through organic growth 
our capital expenditures for fiscal year were  compared to  for fiscal year historically  our capital budget has been intended to replace fixed asset equipment as needed and to take advantage of technological improvements that would improve productivity 
certain critical fixtures  environmental test chambers and testing equipment that were lost in the august  fire were replaced during fiscal year additionally  renovations and reconfiguration to the florida production facility were also made in fiscal year to accommodate the equipment that was previously located in the building destroyed in the august  fire 
inflation and changing prices our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the cost of key operating resources  including labor and raw materials 
substantial increases in cost of sales and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
while we are taking steps to mitigate our risk to rising prices with prudent purchasing practices and improving our inventory management techniques  there can be no assurance that future supplies of raw materials and labor will not fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control 
certain operating costs such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase at or above the general rate of inflation  and we may be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
off balance sheet arrangements we issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit loc in favor of the ministry of defense of the republic of korea in may in the amount of  this loc provides the south korean government with financial assurance that we will perform in accordance with the offset requirements under its contract to provide imfps for south korea s t military aircraft 
the offset requirements specify that we will affect a transfer of technology in accordance with the agreement 
during fiscal year  the company completed its responsibility of transferring technology and was released of further liability associated with this obligation 
accordingly  the irrevocable standby letter of credit was terminated 
apart from this loc  we did not have any other off balance sheet arrangements as of january  contractual obligations the following table presents estimated cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of january  payments due by period less than one year one year to years greater than years to years after years total purchase commitments long term debt revolving credit facility operating leases total contractual obligations acquisitions on august  the closing date we purchased of the outstanding stock of op tech  an oregon based developer and manufacturer of cockpit glass display solutions  from optimization technologies  inc  an oregon corporation the seller 
the acquisition of op tech is consistent with our strategic plan for revenue growth into related industry markets 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method 
in connection with the acquisition  we  op tech  and the seller  along with certain holders of the seller s capital stock  entered into a share purchase agreement the spa  whereby we paid  to the seller 
the spa also provides for the seller to additionally receive i up to  payable in our common stock once we obtain certain federal certifications for op tech s products  subject to seller s delivery of a duly executed subscription agreement  which provides for the seller s receipt of such stock  and a duly executed lock up agreement  which prohibits a transfer by seller for two years from the date of issuance of such stock and ii up to  if certain sales targets  or greater are met with respect to op tech s products within three years of the closing date 
as of january   no additional consideration has been recorded  nor have the contingencies been met 
environmental matters in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility  we engaged an environmental consulting firm to survey the property for any possible soil or groundwater contamination 
this survey revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents by a former owner of the property 
as a result  of the initial and subsequent surveys  remaining contamination treatment costs are estimated at  the company has capitalized these contamination treatment costs as an increase to property held for sale  net  since such costs will be incurred in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility and will not result in a carrying value in excess of the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
costs incurred during the year ended january  totaled  and costs incurred during the year ended january  totaled  after the august  fire at our clearwater  florida facility  during a routine investigation by local environmental agencies the company was cited for several violations relating to the storage  handling and disposal of normal chemicals  solvents and paints used in our production facility 
a remediation effort for these violations was approved and commenced early in fiscal year the anticipated costs of remediation and associated fines totaling  are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of january  and the resulting expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of those consolidated financial statements and this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure items  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and as a result of trends and uncertainties identified above under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and in item a 
risk factors 
further  such differences could be material 
set forth below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
we consider critical accounting policies to be those i that require us to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
additionally  the policies discussed below are critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are highly uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on business operations is discussed throughout this md a where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue from sales of its products when the following have occurred evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery or shipment has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for fixed price contracts  the company recognizes revenue on a completed contract units of delivery basis 
the units of delivery method recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of a basic production product delivered during a period and as the cost of earned revenue the costs allocable to the delivered units  costs allocable to undelivered units are reported in the balance sheet as inventory or work in progress 
revenue is recorded when title to the goods passes to the customer  generally upon shipment 
the company recognizes most of its revenue under the completed contract method 
for long term  fixed price contracts meeting certain criteria  the company may elect to follow the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue recognition 
under this method  contract revenue is computed as that percentage of estimated total revenue that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs  after giving effect to the most recent estimates of costs to complete 
from time to time  the company will record costs and estimated profits in excess of billings for a contract 
revisions in costs and revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined without regard to the percentage of completion 
occasionally the company enters into research and development contracts with customers 
when the contracts provide for milestone or other interim payments  generally  the company will recognize revenue when the contract delineates specific and measureable contract performance  attaches a specific value to the deliverable and accomplishment of the deliverable is recognized by the customer 
when there is no milestone or other interim payments  revenue is generally recognized at completion 
as a general matter  the terms specified in customer purchase orders determine whether the company or the customer bears the obligation for payment of freight charges 
while customers pay for freight in most transactions  the company does occasionally pay freight charges on behalf of customers and may bill all or a portion to customers 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses we continuously evaluate our customers and provide reserves for anticipated credit losses as soon as collection becomes compromised 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations of the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
inventories the company values inventory at standard cost which generally reflects the most recent significant cost for manufactured or purchased inventory 
standards are revalued from time to time to reflect the lower of cost using a method that approximates the first in  first out method fifo or net realizable value 
the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory is based upon reviews of inventory quantities on hand  usage and sales history 
work in process inventories we employ certain methods to estimate the value of work in process inventories for financial reporting purposes 
our practice has been to conduct cycle counts of inventory throughout the year 
generally  for items that are in process at the end of a fiscal year  we will make an estimate during the cycle counting process regarding the percentage of completion of such items in order to accurately reflect costs incurred to date on the production of the items that are still in process 
these estimates are affected by the nature of the operation at which the items are located at the time a physical inventory is conducted  and are subject to judgment 
this practice was employed for fiscal years and manufacturing overhead cost application we establish our inventoriable cost of manufacturing overhead by calculating our overhead costs as a percentage of direct labor and applying that percentage to direct labor that has been charged to inventory on a twelve month rolling average basis 
this application percentage is reviewed and adjusted annually 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we account for income taxes in accordance with us gaap  which states that deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against the future benefit of deferred tax assets to the extent it is determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
property held for sale property held for sale is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
depreciation on property held for sale is discontinued at the time the criteria  established by us gaap  are met 
the earlysville  virginia property is presently held for sale 
the property consists of a  square foot manufacturing facility on approximately acres of land 
in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility  we engaged an environmental consulting firm to survey the property for any possible soil or groundwater contamination 
this survey revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents by a former owner of the property 
as a result  of the initial and subsequent surveys  remaining contamination treatment costs are estimated at  the company has capitalized these contamination treatment costs as an increase to property held for sale  net  since such costs will be incurred in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility and will not result in a carrying value in excess of the estimated fair value less cost to sell 
costs incurred during the year ended january  totaled  and costs incurred during the year ended january  totaled  goodwill and intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and will be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
as current events and circumstances warrant  the company examines the carrying value of its intangible assets with finite lives  such as capitalized software and development costs  purchased intangibles  and other long lived assets  to determine whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause impairment include negative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
long lived assets the useful lives of property  plant and equipment for purposes of computing depreciation are land improvements years buildings and improvements years machinery and equipment years patterns  dies  and tools years furniture and fixtures years we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment and will record an impairment charge whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
as of january  and  we do not believe that any assets are impaired 
we will capitalize production costs for computer software that is to be utilized as an integral part of a product when both a technological feasibility is established for the software  and  b all research and development activities for the other components of the product have been completed 
amortization is charged to expense at the greater of the expected unit sales versus units sold or the straight line method for a period of three years from the date the product becomes available for general release to customers 
income taxes the company and its includable subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return in accordance with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
valuation allowances are established when management determines  based on available information  that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established as well as the amount of such allowances 
when making such determination  consideration is given to  among other things  the following future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
the company classifies tax related interest and tax related penalties as a component of income taxes 
research and development research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred 
environmental expenditures the company assesses its property held for sale  along with any property that is being taken out of its initially intended use  for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances that would result in an environmental liability 
in addition  management assesses its current property in use for any environmental issues 
liabilities for environmental remediation costs not related to retirements of tangible long lived assets  and arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources  are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with environmental remediation are expensed as incurred 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties  which are probable of realization  are separately recorded as assets  and are not offset against the related environmental liability  in accordance with us gaap 
stock based compensation the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of us gaap using the modified prospective transition method which requires us to recognize compensation expense on a prospective basis 
us gaap requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the award 
under this method  in addition to reflecting compensation for new share based awards  expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining service period of awards that had been included in pro forma disclosure in prior periods 
the stock based compensation expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the fiscal years ended january  and january   the company recorded stock based compensation of  and  respectively 
stock issued in payment for services provided by members of the board of directors is expensed in the period the services are provided 
during the fiscal years ended january  and january   the company recorded director fees expense  through the issuance of stock  of  and  respectively 
use of estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
these principles require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported and contingent amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  including such items as i inventory  restructuring and environmental costs  ii percentage of completion estimates  iii other miscellaneous accruals and iv valuation allowances for accounts receivable  inventory and deferred tax assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences could be material 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset is applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
additional disclosures are required to be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification codification 
the codification became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  emerging issues task force eitf and related literature 
the codification eliminates the previous us gaap hierarchy and establishes one level of authoritative us gaap 
all other literature is considered non authoritative 
the codification changes the referencing and organization of accounting guidance and is effective for the company beginning the quarter ended october  the codification does not change us gaap and only affects how specific references to us gaap literature are disclosed in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not issue or invest in financial instruments or their derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
our market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates pertaining to our borrowings under our existing debt facilities which require the payment of interest at a variable rate equal to one month libor plus basis points 
we therefore are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
any increase in these rates could adversely affect our interest expense 
the extent of market rate risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates is not quantifiable or predictable because of the volatility of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
we use no derivative products to hedge or mitigate interest rate risk 
based on the outstanding balances on our credit facilities as of january   a increase in interest rates would cost us approximately  annually 
we purchase materials for use in our products based on market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the materials purchased can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to mitigate this risk  in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase agreements with reasonable terms 
we also have a market risk exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we have a limited number of purchase and sale transactions that are denominated in british pounds 
our strategy in managing this risk exposure is to match the timing of british pound denominated cash inflows and outflows
