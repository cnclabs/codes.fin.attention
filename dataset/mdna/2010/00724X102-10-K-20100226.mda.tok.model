item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we encourage you to read this md a in conjunction with our financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k and the risk factors contained in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
executive summary we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel prescription pain management products 
in may  the us food and drug administration fda approved our first product  entereg alvimopan 
entereg is specifically indicated to accelerate the time to upper and lower gastrointestinal gi recovery following partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis 
delayed gi recovery causes significant complications for patients and results in increased expense to healthcare providers 
we also have a number of product candidates in various stages of clinical and preclinical development 
for the year ended december   our total revenues and net loss were million and million  respectively 
net sales of entereg for the year ended december  were million  which amount includes million for product that was shipped to registered hospitals in  but not recognized as revenue at the time of shipment under our previous revenue recognition policy 
we will need net sales of entereg to increase significantly beyond current levels before we will be able to achieve profitability and positive cash flow from operations 
ultimately  we may never generate sufficient revenues from entereg for us to reach profitability  generate positive cash flow or sustain  on an ongoing basis  our current or projected levels of operations 
in june  we announced a restructuring that resulted in the reduction of approximately positions  or of our workforce  as well as other cost saving initiatives 
we reduced and restructured our research group to focus on late stage  preclinical compounds  with fewer resources dedicated to early stage discovery programs 
during the year ended december   we recorded a restructuring charge of million  consisting of million related to employee severance and benefits related costs and a million non cash asset impairment charge 
entereg together with our partner  glaxo group limited glaxo  we launched entereg in the united states in mid entereg is detailed primarily by glaxo s national hospital based sales organization 
we co promote entereg in certain hospitals with a field force that numbers approximately persons 
entereg was approved subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy under which the product is available only to hospitals that perform bowel resections and are enrolled in the entereg access support and education ease program 
as of december   approximately  hospitals have registered in the ease program 
additionally  as of december   we estimate that approximately hospitals had accepted entereg for inclusion on their formularies  including approximately of the  hospitals that collectively perform approximately of the bowel resection surgeries in the united states 
under our agreement with glaxo  we have a profit sharing arrangement under which we are allocated of profits and losses  as defined  and glaxo is allocated of profits and losses 
profits and losses are calculated as net sales of entereg less certain agreed upon costs and are subject to certain adjustments 
beginning in mid  the parties will share such profits and losses equally 

table of contents as required by our fda approval letter for entereg  we began a phase clinical trial in the first quarter of intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of entereg in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer 
delta opioid receptor agonists we are collaborating with pfizer inc pfizer for the development and commercialization of the delta opioid receptor agonist compounds adl and adl pfizer compounds pf and pf  respectively for the treatment of pain 
the delta receptor is one of three opioid receptors that are believed to modulate pain  although today all marketed opioid drugs interact primarily with only one such receptor  the mu receptor 
we have identified a series of novel  orally active delta agonists that selectively stimulate the delta opioid receptor 
our goal is to develop medications that produce pain relief similar to traditional mu opioids  while reducing or eliminating some typical narcotic side effects seen with mu opioids  including dependence  sedation and respiratory depression 
in october  pfizer and we initiated a phase a proof of concept study of adl and adl in osteoarthritis oa patients 
in january  pfizer and we also initiated a phase a proof of concept study of adl in post herpetic neuralgia phn 
opioid bowel dysfunction program opioid receptors in the gi tract  or peripheral opioid receptors  regulate functions such as motility  water secretion and absorption 
stimulation of these gi mu opioid receptors by morphine  or other opioid analgesics  can slow gut motility and disrupt normal gi function that allows for the passage  absorption and excretion of ingested solid materials resulting in a number of symptoms  including severe constipation 
in patients who take opioid analgesics to treat chronic and persistent pain  this condition is known as opioid bowel dysfunction obd 
we are developing adl and adl to treat obd 
these compounds are small molecule  mu opioid receptor antagonists intended to block the adverse effects of opioid analgesics on the gi tract without affecting analgesia 
we submitted an investigational new drug application ind for adl in september and initiated clinical evaluation of this compound during the fourth quarter of we licensed adl from eli lilly and company lilly in september and initiated clinical testing of this compound in february discovery research and in licensing efforts following our restructuring in june  we reorganized our research group to focus on late stage  preclinical compounds  with fewer resources dedicated to early stage discovery programs 
further  we believe there may be opportunities to expand our product portfolio through the acquisition or in licensing of products and or product development candidates and we intend to continue to explore and evaluate such opportunities 
the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations as of december  and and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  and million at december   representing of our total assets 
we invest excess cash in us treasury obligations 
our working capital  which is calculated as current assets less current liabilities  was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital was primarily from the use of cash to fund our operations  offset partially by million of cash received from net sales of entereg and million received from glaxo as a result of the modification of certain payment provisions under our collaboration agreement 

table of contents the following is a summary of selected cash flow information for the years ended december   and year ended december  net loss adjustments for non cash operating items net cash operating loss net change in assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash used in operating activities net operating cash outflows of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulted primarily from research and development expenditures associated with our product candidates and selling  general and administrative expenses  offset by payments received under the glaxo and pfizer collaboration agreements 
for the year ended december   we received net payments of million under such collaboration agreements 
of the million received  million was related to the acceleration of payments owed by glaxo to us under the terms of amendment no 
of the glaxo collaboration agreement 
in addition  we received million of cash related to net shipments of entereg during in  we received million under our collaboration agreements  including a million milestone payment from glaxo following fda approval of entereg 
in addition  we received million of cash related to net shipments of entereg during in  we received million under our collaboration agreements  consisting primarily of million received from pfizer upon execution of the collaboration agreement relating to our delta opioid receptor agonists 
net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by investing activities relates to purchases and maturities of investment securities  expenditures for property and equipment and in process research and development  and proceeds from the sale of equipment 
capital expenditures are primarily for the purchase of laboratory equipment  furniture and fixtures  office equipment and leasehold improvements associated with our leased facility 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by investing activities in is primarily attributable to an increase of million in the net maturities of available for sale securities and cash proceeds of million received from the disposal of equipment  offset partially by million of payments made during related to the purchase of in process research and development 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in is primarily attributable to a decrease in the net maturities of available for sale securities 
we expect to fund a significant portion of our future operations through the sale or maturities of investments in our portfolio  which consists of us treasury obligations 

table of contents contractual commitments the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts payments due by period contractual obligations total and and and thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total contractual commitments in the table above represent future cash obligations that are legally binding and enforceable under agreements with third parties 
these amounts relate to future minimum payments for the manufacture of entereg  the use of software and operating leases for office and laboratory space 
the table summarizes our significant contractual commitments as of december  and the effects such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
excluded from the table above are contingent liabilities associated with various agreements into which we have entered for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates and for consulting and other contracted services 
these contingent liabilities require future performance by the third party in order for payment to be executed  and we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
we estimate that approximately million will be payable in future periods under the arrangements in place at december  of this amount  approximately million has been accrued for work estimated to have been completed as of december  and approximately million relates to future performance under these arrangements 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future royalty and milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing agreements 
payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  we have not recorded a liability on our balance sheet for any such contingencies 
as of december   the maximum potential milestone payments due under current contractual agreements are million 
glaxo collaboration agreement under the terms of the glaxo agreement  we reimburse glaxo for a portion of certain third party expenses incurred by them relating to entereg  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget which is subject to annual review 
we also incur certain third party expenses ourselves relating to entereg  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget  a portion of which are reimbursable to us by glaxo 
we record these expenses as incurred 
pfizer collaboration agreement under the terms of the pfizer agreement  we reimburse pfizer for a portion of certain third party expenses incurred by them relating to our delta opioid agonists  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget that is subject to annual review 
we also incur certain third party expenses ourselves relating to the delta opioid agonists  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget  a portion of which is reimbursable to us by pfizer 
we record these expenses as incurred 
license agreements in november  roberts laboratories  inc roberts licensed from lilly certain intellectual property rights relating to entereg 
in june  we entered into an option and license agreement with roberts under 
table of contents which we sublicensed these rights from roberts 
in december  shire us inc shire became the successor in interests to roberts under our option and license agreement with roberts 
the company has made license and milestone payments under this agreement totaling million  including million paid during as a result of the regulatory approval of entereg 
our license to entereg and our obligations to pay royalties to shire and lilly expire on the later of either the date of the last to expire of the licensed lilly patents or november  in september  we acquired from lilly the exclusive worldwide rights to adl adl is a potent opioid receptor antagonist  with potential use in multiple therapeutic indications 
we intend to develop adl to treat obd and began a phase clinical trial of this compound for this indication in february under the terms of the agreement  we paid lilly million in september in addition to the million payment  we will be required to pay milestones  which are contingent upon achievement of pre defined  late stage clinical and regulatory events and achievement of certain sales targets  and royalties on net sales of the product 
outlook we expect to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our operations 
since inception  we have experienced significant operating losses and negative operating cash flow and have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of our equity securities  as well as from amounts received under collaboration agreements 
our accumulated deficit at december  was million and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years 
we may never generate significant product sales  achieve profitable operations or generate positive cash flows from operations and  even if profitable operations are achieved  they may not be sustained on a continuing basis or sufficient to support our current or projected levels of investment in our research and development programs and our other operations 
at this time  we cannot accurately assess a number of factors that will influence the levels of future product sales  such as the degree of market acceptance  patent protection and exclusivity of entereg  the impact of competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop  receive approval for and successfully launch other product candidates 
however  at current expenditure levels  we will need entereg sales to increase significantly beyond current levels before we will be able to achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operations 
costs associated with the manufacture of alvimopan prior to fda approval of entereg were expensed to research and development 
as a result  at december   we have inventory related to alvimopan that carries a zero cost and is not reflected on the december  balance sheet 
certain of this inventory is expected to be used in further research and development activities  with the remaining inventory available for commercial sale 
to the extent that this inventory is sold  our cost of product sales will not reflect all costs associated with such product manufacture  and our gross margins will be favorably impacted 
we currently are unable to estimate the timing of the impact to future profitability resulting from the sell through of any inventory manufactured after fda approval of entereg 
we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures related to our clinical product candidates 
in  we expect to fund a number of clinical programs including  among others  our ongoing phase study of entereg in patients undergoing radical cystectomy  the phase a clinical trials of adl and adl in oa and phn and the phase clinical trials for adl and adl in obd 
we also expect to continue to conduct research  preclinical studies and process development activities on our other preclinical product candidates  although as a result of our recent restructuring  the level of such expenditures will be significantly reduced compared to previous years 
should these programs advance to later stages of development  it is likely that expenses related to these efforts will increase over time 

table of contents we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are adequate to fund our operations through based upon the level of research and development and marketing and administrative activities we believe will be necessary to achieve our strategic objectives 
we may need to obtain funding for our future operational needs  and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the discussion above under liquidity and capital resources 
revenues the following table sets forth revenues for the years ended december   and year ended december  product sales  net contract revenues total revenues  net product sales  net net product sales are derived solely from entereg 
entereg was approved by the fda in may and product shipments to hospitals began in june for a discussion of our revenue recognition policy  see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition section of md a 
net sales of entereg were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net product sales during resulted primarily from a full year of sales as well as an increase in the number of hospitals ordering entereg 
in addition  net product sales for the year ended december  include million for product that was shipped to registered hospitals in  but not recognized as revenue at the time of shipment under our previous revenue recognition policy 
no product sales were recognized prior to contract revenues contract revenues are derived from our collaboration agreements with glaxo and pfizer and include milestone payments  cost reimbursement  amortization of up front license fees and other revenue 
contract revenues were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
contract revenues decreased in compared to due primarily to a million milestone payment received from glaxo during in conjunction with the fda approval of entereg 
in addition  contract revenues from pfizer for the year ended december  decreased due to a reduction in delta program costs  which resulted in lower cost reimbursement  as well as reduced amortization of deferred licensing fees due to extensions of the estimated performance period in the third quarter of and the first quarter of these decreases were partially offset by increased revenue that was recognized related to million of payments received from glaxo during the year ended december  under the terms of amendment no 
to the collaboration agreement 
of the million received  million is being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining performance period under the collaboration agreement  which extends to march  and the remaining million was recognized as revenue in the increase in compared to was primarily the result of the million milestone payment received from glaxo following fda approval of entereg and an increase of million due to a full year of contract revenues under the pfizer collaboration 

table of contents costs and expenses the following table sets forth costs and expenses for the years ended december   and year ended december  cost of product sales research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charge total costs and expenses cost of product sales cost of product sales was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and consisted primarily of royalty payments under certain alvimopan license agreements  fda fees and manufacturing costs 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased sales of entereg 
no cost of product sales was recognized prior to costs associated with the manufacture of alvimopan prior to the fda approval of entereg in may were expensed to research and development when incurred 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses can be identified as internal or external expenses 
external expenses include expenses incurred with clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers and other third party vendors 
internal expenses include expenses such as personnel  laboratory and overhead expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and consisted of the following year ended december  external research and development expenses entereg delta agonist program obd program other programs total external research and development expenses total internal research and development expenses total research and development expenses we report all expenses gross within our statements of operations and  as such  the above table does not reflect any cost reimbursements from our collaboration partners 
total research and development expenses decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to lower costs of clinical studies incurred during in our delta agonist program  lower expenses in other programs and a reduction in headcount and depreciation expenses resulting from our june restructuring 
these decreases were partially offset by higher expenses in our obd program  including a million payment to lilly for the rights to adl in september which was expensed as in process research and development 

table of contents total research and development expenses increased in as compared to due to the costs of phase a clinical studies in our delta agonist program  increased activity in our other programs and increased internal research and development expenses  partially offset by lower expenses in our obd program 
there are significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the preclinical and clinical studies associated with each of our research and development programs 
these studies may yield varying results that could delay  limit or prevent the advancement of a program through the various stages of product development and significantly impact the costs to be incurred  and time involved  in bringing a program to completion 
as a result  the cost to complete such programs  as well as the period in which net cash inflows from significant programs are expected to commence  are not reasonably estimable 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily driven by higher sales and marketing expenses associated with entereg  including the expansion of our sales force and marketing activities 
these higher sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses year over year 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  also include million of profit sharing expense that was recognized during as a result of our change in revenue recognition policy 
prior to  entereg profit sharing expenses that were based on net product shipments were deferred until the corresponding net product shipments were recognized as revenue 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of higher sales and marketing expenses associated with the launch of entereg  including advertising and promotional expenses 
restructuring charge as a result of our restructuring in june  we recorded a charge of million for the year ended december   which consisted of million of employee severance and benefits related costs and a million non cash impairment charge primarily related to leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment used for activities which were eliminated pursuant to our restructuring 
there were no restructuring charges for the years ended december  and interest income and other income  net the following table sets forth interest income and other income  net  for the years ended december   and year ended december  interest income other income  net total interest income and other income  net interest income our interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreases year over year were due to lower investment balances resulting primarily from the use of cash in operating activities and lower prevailing interest rates in each successive year 

table of contents other income  net other income  net  was million for each of the years ended december  and and primarily represents cash received from the sale of certain pennsylvania research and development tax credits 
there was no other income for the year ended december  income taxes as of december   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards  which are potentially available to offset future taxable income 
the state net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring during and the federal net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in in addition  the utilization of the state net operating loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
at december   we also had million of federal and million of state research and development tax credit carryforwards  which begin expiring in  and are available to reduce federal and state income taxes 
the tax reform act of the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we may have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings 
additionally  because united states and certain state tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal and state income tax purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our md a discusses our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we develop and periodically change these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our financial statements for the year ended december  included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
in addition  the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
management considers the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab and financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition asc 
product sales  net entereg was approved by the fda in may and product shipments to hospitals began in june hospital orders are processed through wholesalers  however  entereg is drop shipped from glaxo directly to an ordering hospital registered under the ease program 
wholesalers remit payment to glaxo and  on a 
table of contents monthly basis  glaxo remits the net proceeds to us 
in accordance with sab and sab  we recognize revenue from product sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we deferred recognition of revenue associated with the first shipment of entereg to each hospital customer as we were not able to reasonably estimate future returns 
when an existing customer placed a new order  we recognized product sales on the previous shipment for an amount equal to the lesser of a the previous shipment or b the new order 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to recognize net product sales upon the shipment of product to the registered hospital  as we had developed sufficient historical experience to reasonably estimate future returns of entereg 
in the future  actual returns could exceed our estimates of expected returns  which would result in a reduction to our net product sales 
as a result of the change in our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter  net product sales for the year ended december  include million for product that was shipped to registered hospitals in  but not recognized as revenue at the time of shipment 
we also recognized million of selling  general and administrative expenses during that had been deferred under our previous revenue recognition policy 
the change in our revenue recognition policy resulted in a decrease to net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  we record product sales net of prompt payment discounts  returns and other discounts as reported to us by glaxo 
calculating these allowances requires significant estimates and judgments and while we undertake certain procedures to review the reasonableness of the information  we cannot obtain absolute assurance over the accuracy of such information provided by glaxo 
contract revenues contract revenues  which include revenues from collaborative agreements  consist primarily of milestone payments  cost reimbursement  amortization of up front license fees and other revenue under such agreements 
non refundable up front license fees are recognized as revenue if we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations  can be separated in accordance with asc we would recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license had standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations could not be determined  the up front license payment would be recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are to be performed 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement and subsequently adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based upon available facts and circumstances 
during the third quarter of  the pfizer performance period was extended by six months to august based on the status of the development programs 
the effect of the third quarter change in estimate was an increase to net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  during the first quarter of  the performance period was further extended by four months to december based on the status of the development programs 
the effect of the first quarter change in estimate was an increase to net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  our collaboration agreements also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance payments that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met i the milestone payment is non refundable  ii achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  iii substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  iv the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation 
table of contents to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and v a reasonable amount of time passes between the up front license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves the judgment of management 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and such payment would therefore be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed in accordance with the policies described above 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of asc are met  the amounts are determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria for contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as long term deferred revenue 
the estimate of the classification of deferred revenue as current or non current is based upon management s estimate of its performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement 
these estimates may change in the future and such changes to estimates would be accounted for prospectively and would result in a change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
research and development expenses we have entered into contracts with third parties to conduct certain research and development activities including preclinical  clinical and manufacturing activities 
we accrue expenses related to such contracts based upon an estimate of the amounts due for work completed under the contracts 
factors considered in preparing such estimates include the number of subjects enrolled in studies and other criteria relating to the progress of efforts by our vendors 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  as determined on a first in  first out  or fifo  basis 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels to determine if there is inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements 
based on our review  we will determine if a write down of inventory is necessary  and if so  will record the charge to cost of product sales 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off to cost of product sales 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
since inception  we have not recorded any write downs of inventory 
valuation of equipment and leasehold improvements our equipment and leasehold improvements have been recorded at cost and are being depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
we periodically assess our equipment and leasehold improvements for impairment in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment 
we review long lived assets  specifically equipment and leasehold improvements  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  impairment loss would be tested for if estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
the impairment charge  if any  is determined based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value  with fair value determined based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows or other appropriate measures of fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash impairment charge primarily related to leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment used for activities which were eliminated pursuant to our june restructuring 

table of contents equity based compensation we follow the fair value method of accounting for our employee stock option grants  which requires the recognition of compensation expense in the statement of operations 
the grant date fair value of our stock option awards is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires several inputs  including volatility and the expected life of our options 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of stock options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
the expected life of our stock options represents the period of time that option awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns  which we believe are relevant indicators of future exercise patterns 
the grant date fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award using the straight line method 
for equity based awards with performance conditions  we recognize compensation cost if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
for any equity based awards that do not vest on a monthly basis  we estimate a forfeiture rate based on our historical experience of pre vesting forfeitures

in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu  which requires companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on the estimated selling price of each deliverable  when such deliverables are not sold separately either by the company or other vendors 
asu eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
as a result  the new guidance may allow some companies to recognize revenue on transactions that involve multiple deliverables earlier than under current requirements 
asu is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted at the beginning of a company s fiscal year 
we expect to adopt asu on january  and do not expect asu to have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment assets consist of us treasury obligations 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite also is true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past held and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future to hold  such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated  or face  value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio at december  totaled million  and the weighted average yield to maturity was approximately with maturities of investments ranging up to months
