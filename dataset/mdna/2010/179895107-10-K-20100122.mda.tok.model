our net sales declined or million from  million in to million in this sales reduction and the resulting under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs was the primary reason for our reduced operating profit which declined or million from million in to million in the negative impact of lower sales was offset in part by three significant cost items lower material costs reduced discretionary spending benefits from hvac filter operations restructuring program 
table of contents we realized a to million benefit from the reduction of material costs in compared to this reduction was driven by lower commodity pricing primarily in steel  filter media and adhesives 
in addition  we initiated several projects in which removed material cost from our products without compromising the quality of the product to the end customer 
due to the challenging economic environment in  we established several cost initiatives including headcount reductions  wage freezes and significant cuts in discretionary spending including travel and outside professional services 
as a result of these cost initiatives  we were able to reduce our selling and administrative expenses by million from million in to million in despite this focus on lower costs  we did not sacrifice spending on future growth initiatives including our sales force  customer service or product development 
we largely completed our restructuring program at our hvac filter operations in at the beginning of fiscal year  we completed the consolidation of two manufacturing operations  one distribution facility and one office location facility into one facility in indiana 
as a result of this consolidation and the full year benefits of facilities closed in  we recognized approximately million in fixed cost savings in compared to these fixed cost savings were offset in part by a million impairment charge recognized on a hvac facility in north carolina which we closed in despite the negative comparisons to fiscal  we generated sequentially improving operating performance for each quarter in as follows

dollars in millions except per share data first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales operating profit operating margin diluted earnings per share other significant items impacting the comparison between the years presented are as follows acquisitions during fiscal year we completed six small acquisitions and paid an earn out amount and recieved a refund related to two acquisitions completed prior to fiscal year  all for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
four of these fiscal year acquisitions approximately million were related to companies located in china  including million to purchase the remaining minority interest in our subsidiary in weifang 
the majority of the remaining million of the million was for the purchase of the keddeg company  a us based manufacturer of aerospace filtration products 
these combined acquisitions increased net sales by approximately million and operating profit by approximately million 
at the beginning of fiscal we completed the acquisition of perry equipment corporation peco  a manufacturer of engineered filtration products and technologies primarily used in the natural gas industry 
the purchase price was million  excluding cash acquired 
the peco acquisition increased net sales by approximately million and operating profit by approximately million 
foreign exchange although most foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar throughout  the average exchange rate for most foreign currencies versus the us dollar was weaker for compared to for example  the average exchange rate for the euro was in and in weaker foreign currencies negatively impacted our translated us dollar value of net sales by million and operating profit by million compared to the average exchange rate for most foreign currencies versus the us dollar was stronger in compared to as a result  stronger foreign currencies positively impacted our translated us dollar value of net sales by million and operating profit by million in compared to 
table of contents other income expense interest expense interest expense declined million in compared to million of this decrease was driven by lower interest expense on our line of credit driven by both lower average interest rates in and in and lower average outstanding balances million in and million in 
in addition  the million impact of the mark to market adjustment on the interest rate swap was million lower in compared to interest expense increased million in compared to million of this increase was driven by higher interest expense on our line of credit primarily as a result of amounts borrowed to fund the acquisition of peco 
there was no balance on our line of credit in the remainder of the higher interest expense was related to a million mark to market adjustment on the interest swap in foreign currency gains and losses changes in foreign currency transaction gains and losses contributed a positive million change in other income expense in compared to as most foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar throughout  we recognized approximately million of foreign currency gains in mostly related to the translation of us dollar intercompany debt at our us subsidiaries 
the weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar generated million of foreign currency losses in changes in foreign currency transaction gains and losses contributed an additional loss of million in other income expense in compared to provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in was compared to in this reduction was driven by a higher mix of taxable income in foreign operations with lower tax rates than in the us in addition  several favorable provision to return state tax return adjustments lowered the effective rate 
the relatively low effective tax rate of in was driven by a benefit from the completion of various income tax audits  the finalization of certain income tax liabilities and the cumulative tax benefit from the research and experimentation tax credit extension in shares outstanding average diluted shares outstanding declined million in compared to this reduction was driven almost entirely by the lower dilution from our outstanding stock options and restricted share units as average basic shares outstanding remained consistent from to the full year benefit of our million share repurchase executed in the third quarter of will not be fully realized until average diluted shares outstanding increased million in compared to this increase was driven by a million increase in basic shares outstanding 
average basic shares outstanding increased in due to the issuance of million shares pursuant to the peco acquisition and million shares issued pursuant to stock incentive programs offset by the repurchase of million shares at the beginning of and the full year impact of million shares repurchased throughout

dollars in millions net sales us sales foreign sales including export foreign exchange net decrease the million decrease in net sales to customers within the us was driven by the following hvac filter sales were down approximately million in compared to this decline was driven in part by an approximate million reduction in air filters sold to automobile companies and related tier one and tier two suppliers through our total filtration services business unit as a result of the downturn in the automotive industry 
an additional million reduction was driven by lower air filter sales to m 
we had supplied hvac filters to m for many years although our annual sales have been declining for years as m moved production into its mexican manufacturing facility 
in the third quarter of  we were informed by m that it would no longer be purchasing hvac filters from us 
the lost sales in the fourth quarter in addition to generally lower demand from m in the prior three quarters contributed to the million reduction from sales of natural gas vessels and replacement filter elements grew by million in compared to sales of filters and filter systems to the aviation market grew by approximately million in compared to sales in the remaining filter markets in our industrial environmental filtration segment were down significantly in compared to we were particularly impacted by the downturn in the oil and gas industry as off shore drilling activity declined with lower oil prices 
accordingly  our us sales related to oil and gas drilling declined approximately million in compared to in other markets sales of wire mesh filters to the chemical fiber and plastics markets declined approximately million in compared to  and sales of dust collector systems declined approximately million as this market was significantly impacted by reduced capital spending in the us the million reduction in foreign sales from to was driven by a million decrease in foreign export sales of our natural gas original equipment vessels produced at our north american manufacturing facilities 
approximately million of this million decline was related to shipments to india  africa and the middle east which did not recur in the remainder of the decline in foreign sales was due to an approximate million reduction in dust collector sales in europe 
operating profit for our industrial environmental filtration segment declined million or from to in general  the reduction in operating profit was driven by the aforementioned million reduction in net sales and the resulting under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs world wide  including a million operating profit decline at our oil filtration business which was significantly impacted by reduced offshore drilling activity 
the negative impact of the significant sales decline was offset in part by a million reduction in selling and administrative expenses 
in addition  the near completion of our restructuring program at our hvac operations reduced fixed manufacturing costs by approximately million in however  these savings were offset in part by a million impairment charge recognized in for a hvac facility in north carolina

operating profit declined million or from to this reduction in operating profit was driven by the reduction in sales but was offset in part by savings resulting from cost initiatives to reduce direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
virtually all sales in this segment are denominated in us dollars with about exported outside the us 
table of contents net sales for our packaging segment increased million or from to the additional million of operating profit from to was driven by several initiatives which lowered costs including selling and administrative expenses  direct labor as a percentage of sales and manufacturing overhead 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our financial position remains strong with adequate cash resources and sufficient borrowing capacity under our line of credit 
in the first quarter of  we entered into a five year multicurrency revolving credit agreement credit facility with a group of financial institutions under which we may borrow up to million under a selection of currencies and rate formulas 
this credit facility replaced the million credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in april we believe the financial institutions that are party to this arrangement have adequate capital resources and will be able to fund future borrowings under the credit facility 
at our election the interest rate is based upon either a defined base rate or the libor interest rate plus or minus applicable margins 
at year end  the libor interest rate including margin was 
at november  there was million outstanding on the credit facility with an additional million outstanding on a million letter of credit sub line 
accordingly  we had approximately million available for further borrowing at year end in december  we paid down an additional million on the credit facility 
in the first quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement swap agreement with a bank to manage our interest rate exposure on certain amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
the swap agreement provided for us to pay a fixed interest rate plus applicable margins and receive interest based on a three month libor on a notional amount of million 
the swap agreement was not designated as a hedge for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses were recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
periodic settlement payments or receipts were recorded as a component of cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the fair value of the swap agreement at november  was approximately million and was recorded as part of current accrued liabilities 
the swap agreement expired january  from time to time  we use derivative financial instruments such as the swap agreement to mitigate our exposure to certain market risks 
however  by using derivative financial instruments  we are exposed to credit risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes us  which creates credit risk 
we minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties which we believe have the financial resources to meet their obligations 
cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments increased million to million at year end from million at year end short term investments primarily include tax exempt municipal money market funds 
cash and cash equivalents are held by financial institutions throughout the world 
we regularly review the credit worthiness of these institutions and believe our funds at these institutions are not at significant risk 
the current ratio of at year end was higher than the current ratio of at year end long term debt of million at year end included million outstanding on our credit facility  million outstanding on industrial revenue bonds and million of other long term debt 
at november  and we were in compliance with all financial covenants as included in our credit facility 
we expect to be in compliance with these covenants in the foreseeable future despite the global economic downturn 
the ratio of total debt to total capitalization defined as long term debt plus total shareholders equity was at the end of compared to at the end of we had million shares of common stock outstanding at november  compared to million outstanding at november  the million decrease in outstanding shares was driven by our repurchase of million shares in the third quarter of offset in part by million shares issued in conjunction with incentive plans 
shareholders equity increased to million at year end compared to million at year end this million increase was driven by additional net earnings of million  currency translation adjustments of million and stock and stock compensation expense pursuant to incentive plans of 
table of contents million offset by pension and other postretirement benefits adjustments of million  dividend payments of million and our repurchase of common stock of million 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in from million in this million increase was driven by million of additional cash generated from changes in working capital offset by lower earnings adjusted for non cash items of million 
the million of additional cash generated from changes in working capital was significantly impacted by the million of cash generated from a reduction in accounts receivable which declined as a result of lower net sales 
this cash generated was offset in part by million of additional cash invested in short term investments 
our inventory levels did not decline significantly with lower net sales based upon our strategic decision to maintain high customer fill rates 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million in from million in this million decrease was driven by a million decline in cash generated from changes in working capital offset by higher earnings adjusted for non cash items of million 
the million decline in cash generated from changes in working capital was driven by a million swing in our short term investments as we generated million of net cash in from the sale of short term investments while we invested million of net cash in net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million in compared to million in this decrease was driven by a million reduction in cash used for business acquisitions 
the million invested in business acquisitions in was primarily related to our acquisition of peco 
the million invested in business acquisitions in was driven by several smaller acquisitions 
in addition to reduced investment for business acquisitions  we used million less cash for additions to plant assets in compared to this reduction was primarily related to lower spending for the restructuring of our hvac operations of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities increased million to million in from million in this increase was driven by an additional million invested in business acquisitions in primarily related to the peco acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities increased million in compared to the million cash used in financing activities in was driven by payments of million on our credit facility  million for our repurchase of stock and million for dividends 
these cash outflows were offset by proceeds of million from the re issuance of an industrial revenue bond and million from the issuance of stock pursuant to incentive plans 
the million cash provided by financing activities in was driven by proceeds of million from our credit facility primarily to finance the peco acquisition and million from the issuance of stock pursuant to incentive plans 
these cash proceeds were offset by payments of million on our credit facility  payments of million for the repurchase of stock  million for dividends and million for payments on an industrial revenue bond 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million in compared to this increase in cash generated from to was driven by million of net proceeds under our credit facility and million less cash paid for the repurchase of stock in compared to in june  our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program of our common stock in the open market and through private transactions over a three year period 
this authorization replaced our previous million share repurchase program that expired in june during  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for million 
during  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for million 
at november   there was approximately million available for repurchase under the current authorization 
future repurchases of our common stock may be made after considering cash flow requirements for internal growth including working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  interest rates and the current market price of our common stock 
we believe that our current operations will continue to generate cash and that sufficient lines of credit remain available to fund current operating needs  pay dividends  invest in the development of new products and filter media  fund planned capital expenditures and expansion of current facilities  provide for interest payments and required principal payments related to debt agreements  fund pension plan contributions and repurchase common stock 
we also continue to assess acquisition opportunities in related filtration businesses that would expand our market base  distribution coverage or product offerings 
any such acquisitions may affect operating cash flows

in addition  capital market disruptions may affect the cost or availability of future borrowings

the million outstanding on our credit facility at november  will be due at the maturity of the credit facility in december the million payment for our swap agreement is due in january we do not have a minimum required contribution under the pension benefit guarantee corporation requirements for our us qualified pension plans for however  we anticipate contributing million in a voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plans in in addition  we anticipate contributing million to our non us qualified plan and million to our post retirement health care benefit plan during we anticipate contributing million and million in and  respectively  to our us combined non qualified pension plans covering certain management employees 
future estimates of our pension plan contributions may change significantly depending upon the actual rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and regulatory requirements 
at november   our liability for uncertain income tax provisions was million including interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements relate to various operating leases as discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements 
we had no variable interest entity or special purpose entity agreements during or other matters critical accounting estimates our critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation methods  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and postretirement benefits 
these critical accounting policies may be affected by recent relevant accounting pronouncements discussed in the following section 

table of contents while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these critical accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
the following lists the most critical accounting estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements which requires us to use significant judgment and estimates of amounts that are inherently uncertain goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we annually review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
these reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates of discount rates  terminal values  transaction multiples and future cash flows for the reporting units that may be impacted by future sales and operating results for the reporting units  market conditions and worldwide economic conditions 
all goodwill and intangibles are allocated to the reporting unit component at the time of acquisition 
we have determined that the reporting unit components meet the criteria for aggregation into five reporting units 
these reporting units are aggregated based upon similar economic characteristics  nature of products and services  nature of production processes  type of customers and distribution methods 
in performing our impairment reviews  we estimated the fair values of the aggregated reporting units using a present value method that discounted future cash flows 
for our indefinite lived intangibles  we performed annual impairment tests using the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of our trademarks and trade names 
we further analyzed various discount rates  transaction and capital market multiples and cash flows for aggregated reporting units to assess the reasonableness of our estimates and assumptions 
we believe our valuation techniques and assumptions are reasonable for this purpose 
we have not materially changed our methodology for valuing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
based upon our analysis at november   the estimated fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by at least approximately 
the weighted average excess of fair value over carrying value of all our reporting units was approximately allowance for losses on accounts receivable allowances for losses on customer accounts receivable balances are estimated based on economic conditions in the industries to which we sell and on historical experience by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss  fluctuations in amounts owed and current payment trends 
our concentration of risk is also monitored and at year end  the largest outstanding customer account balance was million and the five largest account balances totaled million 
the allowances provided are estimates that may be impacted by economic and market conditions which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and results of operations 
given the current economic conditions  we are monitoring receivables and credit worthiness of our customers and managing our collections more closely 
pensions our pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rate used for each plan was based on the citigroup pension discount curve 
the projected benefit payments in each year were discounted using the appropriate spot rate from the curve 
for each plan  a single discount rate was determined that produced the same total discounted value 
that rate  rounded to basis points  was the discount rate selected for the plan 
the discount rate used for the qualified plans for us employees was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the qualified plan 
the mortality table for the qualified plans is determined based on the actuarial table that is most reflective of the expected mortality of the plan participants 
the mortality table adopted rp projected was developed for pension plans by a society of actuaries study 
the mortality table used for the nonqualified pension plan is specified by the 
table of contents plan agreement 
the assumptions are similarly determined for each pension obligation 
actual results and future obligations will vary based on changes in interest rates  stock and bond market valuations and employee compensation 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would result in additional expense in fiscal of approximately million  while a reduction in the discount rate of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately million for our qualified defined benefit pension plans for us covered employees 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million at year end is due primarily to prior changes in assumptions related to discount rates and expected compared to actual asset returns 
this actuarial loss will be recognized as pension expense in the future over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plans 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we are required to estimate and record income taxes payable for each of the us and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal  state and international tax transactions for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of such situations and believe that it is properly reserved 
recent market events current market conditions and economic events have significantly impacted the financial condition  liquidity and outlook for a wide range of companies  including many companies outside the financial services sectors 
we have considered the potential impact of such conditions and events as it relates to currently reported financial results of operations and liquidity  including consideration of the possible impact of other than temporary impairment  counterparty credit risk and hedge accounting 
we do not believe that  based on our current investment policies and contractual relationships  we are subject to greater risk from such factors than other companies of similar size and market breadth 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb expanded the required disclosures for pension and other postretirement plans by requiring disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made by management  major categories of plan assets and significant concentration of risk 
additionally  an employer is required to disclose information about the valuation of plan assets 
this accounting guidance is effective for our fiscal year and will affect the disclosures in our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance that requires that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid be considered participating securities and be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
this guidance is effective for our fiscal year and requires the restatement of all previously reported earnings per share data 
our unvested restricted stock units qualify as participating securities under this guidance 
our preliminary assessment is the unvested restricted stock units will not materially affect the computation of earnings per share 
in december  the fasb issued guidance that will affect our accounting for businesses acquired after november   the presentation of noncontrolling interests  previously called minority interests  in our consolidated financial statements and will also require that assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination and arising from a contingency be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period 
we will adopt this guidance in fiscal year which will impact the way we account for future business acquisitions and present noncontrolling interests

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is primarily related to the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we may also be exposed to various market risks that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business related to items such as the cost of raw materials and changes in inflation 
certain contractual relationships with customers and vendors mitigate risks from changes in raw material costs and currency exchange rate changes that arise from normal purchasing and normal sales activities 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to our financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash  cash equivalents and certain short term  highly liquid investments 
interest rate fluctuations could affect earnings  cash flows or the fair value of our financial liabilities 
our debt obligations are primarily at variable rates and are denominated in us dollars 
to minimize the long term costs of borrowing  we manage our interest rate risk by monitoring trends in rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements and the duration of such agreements 
we mitigated our interest rate risk on our borrowing under our revolving line of credit in and by entering into a fixed interest rate swap agreement at the beginning of which fixed our interest until january interest rate risk is not expected to be significant to us in fiscal as amounts outstanding on our long term debt agreements are more than offset by cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we anticipate paying all amounts outstanding on our revolving line of credit in as a result  the primary interest rate risk will be driven by our return on short term investments 
based upon the million in short term investments at november   a increase in interest rates could positively impact annual interest income by million 
this potential interest income benefit would increase or decrease as short term investment balances increase or decrease 
foreign currency since we operate through subsidiaries in several countries around the world  our reported financial results of operations  including the reported value of assets and liabilities  are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of our subsidiaries  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the us are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period 
earnings and cash flow statements are translated at weighted average rates of exchange 
although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact  the translation changes may impact the overall value of net assets 
we are also exposed to transaction risk from changes in foreign currency rates through sales and purchasing transactions when we sell products in functional currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred 
the functional currencies of our worldwide facilities primarily include the us dollar  the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  the chinese yuan renminbi and the 
table of contents mexican peso 
as these currencies fluctuate against each other  and other currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk on sales and purchasing transactions 
currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the us dollar while another currency weakens 
because of the complex interrelationship of the worldwide supply chains and distribution channels  it is difficult to quantify the impact of a particular change in exchange rates 
however  we estimate that if the us dollar strengthened or weakened relative to the currencies where our foreign income and cash flows are derived the effect on the consolidated results of operations could be to per diluted share 
we estimate that the effect of changes in the average foreign currency translation rates in compared to negatively impacted our operating profit by approximately million in as a result of continued foreign sales and business activities  we continue to evaluate derivative financial instruments  including forwards  swaps and purchased options  to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes in the future 
we did not hold any such derivatives during  or related to foreign currency exchange
