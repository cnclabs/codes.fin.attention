item business overview we design  develop  manufacture and market modular power components and complete power systems 
power systems are incorporated into virtually all electronic equipment 
in equipment utilizing alternating current ac voltage from a primary source for example  a wall outlet  a power system converts ac voltage into the stable direct current dc voltage necessary to power subsystems and or individual applications or loads 
in many electronic devices  this dc voltage may be further converted to one or more lower voltages required by a range of loads 
in equipment utilizing dc voltage from a primary source for example  a generator or battery pack  the initial dc voltage frequently requires further conversion to one or more lower voltages 
because numerous applications requiring different dc voltages and varied power ratings may exist within an electronic device  and system power architectures themselves vary  we offer an extensive range of products and accessories in a myriad of application specific configurations 
since our founding  our product strategy has been driven by innovations in design  largely enabled by our focus on the development of differentiated technologies  which often are implemented in proprietary semiconductor circuitry 
many of our products incorporate a high frequency electronic power conversion technology called zero current zero voltage switching zcs zvs  which enabled the design of dc dc converter modules that were much smaller and more efficient than conventional alternatives 
emphasizing the superior power density and performance advantages of this technology  our primary product strategy since our founding has been to offer a comprehensive range of component level building blocks to configure a power system specific to a customer s needs 
since introducing and popularizing the encapsulated brick during the s  our product focus has been on high density dc dc converters  which provide the isolation  transformation  regulation  filtering  and or input protection necessary to power and protect sophisticated electronic loads 
a secondary and highly complementary product strategy has been to incorporate our component level building blocks into complete power systems representing turnkey ac dc and dc dc solutions for our customers power needs 
our product strategy is now increasingly focused on the next generation of component level building block  the v i chip tm  which incorporates our latest advances in zcs zvs technology and other proprietary power conversion innovations 
we believe v i chips offer unprecedented power conversion density ie  the output power in watts as a function of the size of the component in cubic inches  performance ie  benchmarks related to the capabilities of the component  such as conversion efficiency  and flexibility ie  the ability of our customers to implement a broad range of possible configurations 
the applications in which these power conversion and power management products are used are in the higher performance  higher power segments of the power systems market  including telecommunications and networking infrastructure  enterprise and high performance computing  industrial automation  vehicles and transportation  and defense electronics 
our products are sold worldwide to customers ranging from global original equipment manufacturers oems and their contract manufacturers to smaller  independent manufacturers of highly specialized electronic devices 
our business segments are organized by key product lines our brick business unit bbu segment designs  develops  manufactures and markets our modular power converters  known as bricks  and  in  introduced a new line of modular power converter  known as a vi brick tm  incorporating our v i chips into innovative  thermally enhanced packaging 
the bbu also designs  develops  manufactures and markets a line of configurable products  which are complete power supplies assembled using our modular power components 
the bbu includes the operations of our westcor tm division  which is focused only on configurable products  the operations of vicor custom power tm previously known as vicor integration architects tm  which is our turnkey custom power solutions business  and the operations of vicor japan company  ltd 
vjcl  which is our japanese subsidiary 
our v i chip business unit v i chip consists of v i chip corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary that designs  develops  manufactures and markets our factorized power architecture tm fpa products 
in april  we introduced fpa  a new power system architecture based on an array of proprietary power conversion innovations building upon our long standing leadership in the design of power conversion technologies 
we believe fpa provides power system designers enhanced performance at a lower cost than can be attained with conventional power architectures 
as v i chips and fpa represent innovative alternatives to such conventional products and architectures  we established a separate business unit to enable the organizational focus necessary to support early adopters of these disruptive technologies 
our picor business unit picor consists of picor corporation  a majority owned subsidiary of vicor and a fabless designer  developer  and marketer of high performance integrated circuits and related products for use in a variety of power system applications 
picor develops these products to be incorporated into vicor s products  to be sold as a complement to our products  or for sale to third parties for separate applications 
much of the differentiation of our bbu and v i chip products has been a result of implementation of our power conversion innovations in proprietary semiconductor circuitry 
because of the considerable semiconductor design expertise embodied in this captive organization and the potential for success as a merchant vendor of an expanding portfolio of proprietary circuit designs  we established picor as a separate business unit to enable organizational focus and to facilitate a distinct go to market strategy

market background  product trends and vicor strategy the market for power supplies and their enabling components continues to evolve in response to advancing technologies and corresponding changes in customer requirements 
similarly  we evolved our strategy to address evolving market challenges and opportunities 
many of the ongoing changes in the market  particularly in those segments in which we compete  have been characterized by improvement in product performance eg  power conversion efficiency  reduction in product form factor ie  size  and increased design flexibility ie  the ability of customers to address their power requirements with a broad range of alternative solutions 
product trends have been characterized by the disaggregation of the functions of power components such as dc dc converters  thereby driving further improvement in overall power supply performance  further reduction in form factor  and greater flexibility in the way designers implement power supply solutions 
in  we introduced an enhancement of the standardized  high density power converter to the market the fully encapsulated brick  utilizing our zcs zvs technology  in standardized dimensions of x x 
our innovative  patented technology provided superior efficiency and overall performance in a small form factor  while full encapsulation provided not only full shielding from environmental influences  but enhanced thermal performance characteristics 
such thermal performance enhancement has been critical to the differentiated performance of our power converters  as the by product of voltage conversion is heat  which must be dissipated in order to assure the performance of the converter itself and the overall system to which it is delivering power 
in response to market and technology trends and changes in our customer requirements  we have implemented a strategy addressing both the realities of the current power conversion marketplace and our vision of the long term direction of that marketplace 
our strategy involves maintaining a viable  profitable legacy business  while investing in the next generation of power management components 
our early technical and performance leadership contributed to the development of an image in the market as a power component innovator 
the bbu experienced strong revenue growth and robust profitability during the s and s  as important markets for our products expanded 
however  a significant amount of our revenue was derived from the telecommunications market and  when that market collapsed in the early s  we had to reassess our product portfolio and overall competitive positioning 
many of our domestic competitors faced the same circumstances and reoriented their strategies to serve high volume applications of large oems 
in doing so  they moved much of their manufacturing from the united states to lower cost countries where the contract manufacturers used by their oem customers were based 
we chose not to follow these competitors  remained a domestic manufacturer  and shifted our competitive positioning to one based on mass customization 
as a part of our repositioning  we invested significantly in new product designs that emphasized low cost and flexible manufacturing  as well as the plant equipment and information technology necessary to support such low cost and flexible manufacturing 
we also modified our go to market strategy to emphasize serving lower volume customers requiring higher value solutions 
as such  today our product portfolio is extremely broad  while our customer base and the market segments we serve are far more diverse than prior to the change in our go to market strategy 
our mass customization model allows us to profitably meet the specific design and volume requirements of numerous  relatively low volume customers 
our decision to not pursue higher volume oem opportunities constrained our growth during the economic recovery from into  but our profitability during this period benefited from our value added approach 
we believe this approach will contribute to less volatility of our financial performance during the current period of economic decline  as our customers rely on us for power conversion solutions they generally cannot obtain from our volume oriented competitors 
at the same time we undertook a repositioning of the bbu  our legacy business  we announced our vision for the future of component based power conversion fpa and v i chips 
since our founding  our products have been based on advanced  highly differentiated designs 
much of our intellectual property is patented or otherwise proprietary to us 
however  as is typical across the information technology and electronics markets  the segments in which we have competed matured relatively quickly and became characterized by product commoditization and price competition 
given our extensive experience with power conversion technologies and our understanding of trends in both technology and our markets  we concluded the appropriate complement to maintaining our legacy business would be to seek to redefine the competitive landscape in the long term with our innovative  flexible new power distribution architecture and our next generation of advanced  highly differentiated designs 
we believe traditional power architectures  in the long run  may not provide the performance necessary to address power system trends  given the trends toward lower voltages  higher currents  more on board voltages  and the higher speeds and performance demands of numerous complex loads 
fpa and v i chips address these trends  while providing significantly improved electrical performance and greater reliability  at a lower overall cost 
our v i chips and much of their enabling technologies are protected by domestic and foreign patents and patent applications 
we believe our market leadership is further protected by proprietary trade secrets associated with our use of certain components and materials of our own design  as well as our significant experience with manufacturing  packaging and testing these complex devices 
picor is a highly complementary element of our strategy to redefine the competitive landscape in the long term 
many of the differentiated capabilities of our brick and v i chip products have been a result of implementation of our power conversion innovations in proprietary semiconductor circuitry 
most notably  proprietary  highly advanced microcontroller circuits are found in many of our most successful switching power components 
while the majority of picor s activities to date have involved supplying integrated circuits for internal use  picor s strategy is to become a merchant vendor of innovative power management circuitry  whether in individual packages  multi chip modules  or subassemblies 
as such  picor s current and planned products represent a complement to fpa and v i chips 
our products our website  www 
vicorpower 
com  sets forth detailed information describing all of products and the applications for which they may be used 
the information contained on our website is not a part of  or incorporated by reference into  this annual report on form k and shall not be deemed filed under the exchange act 
our principal product lines are bricks modular power converters brick dc dc power converters are well established as an important enabling component of conventional power systems architectures 
the bbu currently offers seven families of high power density  component level dc dc power converters the vi tm  vi j tm  mi tm  mi j tm  maxi  mini and micro families 
designed to be mounted directly on a printed circuit board chassis using contemporary manufacturing processes  each brick family is a comprehensive set of products offered in a wide range of input voltage to volts dc and output power to watts 
this allows end users to select power component products appropriate to their individual applications 
the product families differ in maximum power ratings  performance characteristics  package size and  in certain cases  characteristics specific to the targeted market 
all of our brick products are encapsulated with a dielectric  elastomeric  thermally conductive material  thereby providing electrical insulation  thermal conductivity  and environmental protection of the electronic circuitry 
the custom module design system tm cmds  a core component of the vicor powerbench tm tool suite on our website  is a proprietary system enabling our customers to specify on line  and verify in real time  the performance and attributes of its dc dc converters 
not merely a product configuration tool like those offered by our competitors  the cmds enables the comprehensive design of dc dc converters in all of our established brick form factors ie  full  half and quarter size  using patented web based technology 
cmds is an important element of our mass customization strategy 
the vi brick combines the superior technical attributes of our v i chip technology with robust packaging offering superior thermal characteristics and facilitating a range of board mounting alternatives 
vi brick models include high current density low voltage dc dc converters  a wide range of highly efficient bus converters  and individual models for both regulation and transformation 
we are focusing our product development efforts within the bbu on the design of vi brick modules 
accessory power system components accessory power system components  used with our component level power converters  integrate other important functions of the power system  facilitating the design of complete power systems by interconnecting several modules 
these other functions include input filtering  power factor correction  transient protection and ac line rectification 
in general  products from our broad line of accessory components are used to condition and or filter the input and output voltages of the modular power components 
examples of such accessory products include our vi ham tm harmonic attenuator module  a universal ac input  power factor correcting front end for use with compatible dc dc power converters  and our vi aim tm ac input module  which provides input filtering  transient protection and rectification of the ac line 
configurable products utilizing our modular power components as core elements  we have developed several configurable product families that provide complete power solutions configured to a customer s specific needs 
these products exploit the benefits and flexibility of the modular approach to offer higher performance  higher power densities  lower costs  and faster delivery than many competitive offerings 
configurable products are designed  developed and manufactured by the bbu  which offers a range of ac dc and dc dc products  by its westcor division  which focuses on high power ac dc power supplies  and by vjcl 
most information technology  process control  and industrial electronic products operate directly off of ac lines and  as such  require circuitry to convert ac line voltage into the required dc voltage 
our configurable ac dc power systems  the flatpac tm  vipac tm power system  and lopac tm families  incorporate front end ac dc circuitry subassemblies  thereby providing a complete power solution from ac line input to one or more dc outputs 
these configurable products are characterized by their low profile design and are configurable in a range of sizes and outputs up to  watts 
many telecommunications switching  transportation and defense electronic products are powered from central dc sources eg  generators or banks of batteries 
our configurable dc dc power systems  the vipac array  compac tm  and megamod tm families  also are characterized by a low profile design  including rugged  compact assemblies for chassis mounted  bulk power applications 
our highest power configurable product line  the megapac tm family  is also among our most flexible solutions 
a megapac consists of a fan cooled chassis with up to slots into which are placed converterpac tm modules  which incorporate our brick power conversion modules  allowing for a broad range of customer specific configurations 
the megapac itself can be configured to accept either ac or dc inputs  and output power can be as high as  watts with up to outputs 
the vipac family of power systems is a class of user defined  integrated modular power solution that leverages the latest advances in maxi  mini  and micro dc dc converter technology and modular front ends 
vipac combines application specific front end units  a choice of advantageous chassis styles and  in ac input versions  remotely located hold up capacitors to provide fast  flexible and highly reliable power solutions for a wide range of demanding applications 
we are developing new configurable products incorporating our v i chip components and expect these products  when introduced  will be very competitive with respect to power density and small form factor 
the web based vicor computer assisted design vcad tool  a component of vicor powerbench  can be utilized by the customer to specify and verify  in real time  that customer s desired configuration of our vipac family of configurable products from a broad range of inputs  outputs  packaging and optional features 
similarly  our web based vicor system product online configurator vspoc  also a component of vicor powerbench  allows customers to configure and order westcor ac dc power supplies 
customer specific products certain customers rely on us to design  develop and manufacture custom power systems to meet performance and or form factor requirements that cannot be met with off the shelf system solutions 
by utilizing our power components as building blocks in developing these custom power systems  we have been able to meet such customers needs with reliable  high power density  turnkey solutions 
these low volume  high value add products  besides meeting customers specific requirements  frequently are designed to function reliably in the harsh environments associated with aerospace and defense applications 
we pursue custom opportunities through our vicor custom power network  which consists of six regional design  assembly and customer support locations 
of the six locations  one is a division  three are either wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  and two are minority owned subsidiaries 
v i chip products we have pioneered an innovative new board level power architecture  fpa  which separates or factorizes the basic functions of power conversion voltage transformation  regulation  and isolation into separate power components called v i chips 
our v i chips represent the next generation of modular power components  providing power systems designers the ability to address increasingly challenging requirements 
with each new generation of microprocessor  application specific integrated circuit  and memory  the trend has been toward lower voltages  higher currents  higher speeds and more on board voltages 
system designers must contend with a range of lower voltages  improve overall power system efficiency  and deliver the solution in an ever smaller form factor 
we believe fpa provides power system designers superior power density  conversion efficiency  transient responsiveness  noise performance  reliability  and design flexibility at a lower overall cost than attained with conventional board level power architectures 
we currently offer three v i chip modules the bcm tm bus converter module  an intermediate bus converter  the prm tm pre regulator module  a non isolated regulator  and the vtm tm voltage transformation module  a current multiplier 
bcms and vtms are offered in full ie  square inch and half ie  square inch modules  while prms are offered only as full modules 
a half size prm is under development 
the bcm provides an isolated  unregulated intermediate bus voltage  at efficiencies up to  to power non isolated converters at the point of load from a narrow range dc input 
the prm is a non isolated regulator  operating at up to efficiency  capable of both boosting ie  increasing and bucking ie  reducing an input voltage and providing a regulated  adjustable output voltage or factorized bus 
vtms are designed to meet the demands of advanced microprocessor and memory applications at the point of load with fixed ratio voltage transformation with extremely fast transient response  while providing isolation from input to output 
picor products picor designs  develops  and markets high performance integrated circuits and related products for use in a variety of power system applications 
picor is pursuing a merchant strategy and offers a growing range of products for sale to third parties 
in  picor introduced its cool oring tm line of full function active oring solutions and discrete active oring controllers 
these solutions address the requirements of redundant power architectures implemented in today s high availability systems such as enterprise servers  high performance computing  and telecom and communications infrastructure systems 
picor s product portfolio includes a range of quietpower tm output qpo and input qpi emi filters differentiated by their small  surface mount system in package and low cost 
products are targeted at a range of industry and customer applications 
mil cots products we offer versions of our commercial off the shelf brick converters and accessories  configurable power supplies  and v i chips that meet certain specification standards established by the us department of defense 
such mil cots products meet the performance and reliability requirements associated with use in harsh and demanding environments

our products are sold worldwide to customers ranging from global oems and their contract manufacturers to smaller  independent manufacturers of highly specialized electronic devices 
for the years ended december   and  no single customer accounted for more than of our net revenues 
backlog as of december   we had a backlog of approximately  compared to  on december  backlog is comprised of orders for products for which shipment is scheduled within the next months 
a portion of our sales in any quarter is  and will continue to be  derived from orders booked in the same quarter 
research and development as a basic element of our long term strategy  we are committed to the continued advancement of power conversion technology and power component product development 
we invested approximately   and  in research and development in   and  respectively 
investment in research and development represented   and of net revenues in   and  respectively 
we intend to continue to invest a significant percentage of revenues in research and development activities 
manufacturing and quality assurance our principal manufacturing processes consist of assembly of electronic components onto printed circuit boards  automatic testing of components  wave  reflow and infrared soldering of assembled components  encapsulation of converter subassemblies  final environmental stress screening of certain products and product test using automatic test equipment 
we continue to pursue a manufacturing strategy based upon the phased acquisition and or fabrication  qualification and integration of automated manufacturing equipment to reduce manufacturing costs  increase product quality and reliability and enable rapid and effective expansion of capacity  as needed 
we intend to make continuing investments in manufacturing equipment  particularly for our fpa products and replacement of manufacturing equipment utilized by the bbu 
components and materials used in our products are purchased from a variety of vendors 
most of the components are available from multiple sources 
in instances of single source items  we maintain levels of inventories we consider to be appropriate to enable meeting the delivery requirements of customers 
incoming components  assemblies and other parts are subjected to several levels of inspection procedures 
our compliance with applicable environmental laws has not had a material effect on our financial condition or operating results 
product quality and reliability are a critical to our success and  as such  we emphasize quality and reliability in our design and manufacturing activities 
we follow industry best practices in manufacturing and are compliant with iso certification standards as set forth by the international organization for standardization 
our quality assurance practices include rigorous testing and  as necessary  burn in of our products using automated equipment 
competition the power conversion industry is highly competitive 
it remains highly fragmented  despite significant consolidation during the prior decade 
numerous power supply manufacturers target market segments and applications similar to those we target 
several of these competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and longer operating histories than we do 
with the bbu  our strategy is largely based on mass customization 
we believe we have a strong competitive position  particularly with customers who need small  high density power system solutions requiring a variety of input output configurations 
we compete on the basis of differentiation  offering a broad product line and mass customization abilities 
we also compete by emphasizing technical innovation  product performance  and service and technical support 
we believe the principal competitive variables in the market segments in which the bbu competes are price  performance  and the level of service and technical support offered 
with v i chip  our strategy is largely based on differentiated products offered to  at least during the early adoption of such products  a limited number of larger potential customers well positioned to make the necessary investment to adopt fpa 
v i chip currently competes with vendors of power component solutions  many of which are the manufacturers with which the bbu competes 
in the longer term  we anticipate a significantly broadened market for fpa and v i chip  as awareness of the advantages of fpa and v i chip spreads and a broader audience of potential customers is reached 
picor and  to a lesser extent  v i chip compete with suppliers of integrated circuits for power conversion applications  many of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and longer operating histories 
we believe picor is developing a strong competitive position based on innovative product design and packaging 
patents and intellectual property we believe our patents afford advantages by building fundamental and multilayered barriers to competitive encroachment upon key features and performance benefits of our principal product families 
our patents cover the fundamental conversion topologies used to achieve the performance attributes of our converter product lines  converter array architectures  product packaging design  product construction  high frequency magnetic structures  as well as automated equipment and methods for circuit and product assembly 
we have been issued patents in the united states which expire between and 
we also have a number of patent applications pending in the united states  europe and the far east 
we intend to vigorously protect our rights under these patents 
although we believe patents are an effective way of protecting our technology  there can be no assurances that our patents will prove to be enforceable see  eg  part i  item legal proceedings 
licensing in addition to generating revenue from product sales  licensing is an element of our strategy for building worldwide product and technology acceptance and market share 
in granting licenses  we generally retain the right to use our patented technologies and manufacture and sell our products in all licensed geographic areas and fields of use 
licenses are granted and administered through our wholly owned subsidiary  vlt  inc  which owns our patents 
revenues from licensing arrangements have not exceeded of our consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years 
employees as of december   we employed approximately full time and part time people 
on january   we announced a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately eight percent by the end of january we authorized additional reductions to our workforce in the second and third quarters of we believe our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
although there is strong demand for qualified personnel  we have not to date experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient engineering and technical personnel to meet our needs see part i  item a risk factors 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
item a 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of  among other factors  the risk factors set forth below 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and are subject to fluctuations 
our future operating results  including revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and net income loss  are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the effects of adverse economic conditions in the united states and international markets  especially in light of the current crisis in global credit and financial markets  the level of orders and demand from customers  changes in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products  the effectiveness of our efforts to reduce product costs and manage operating expenses  the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors  the timing  delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory  the ability to hire  retain and motivate qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers  our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels  potential significant litigation related costs  the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide environmental and other regulations  and the effects of public health emergencies  natural disasters  security risk  terrorist activities  international conflicts and other events beyond our control 
as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  if our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors  the market price of our common stock may decline 
the ongoing disruptions in the global economy  as well as continued uncertainty in global financial markets  could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
continued uncertainty in the world s financial markets contributed to widespread economic decline in global financial markets continue to experience disruptions  including diminished liquidity and credit availability 
further disruption and deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products  thereby reducing our revenues and earnings 
in addition  such adverse conditions may  among other things  result in increased price competition for our products  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers  increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable  and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 
any of these items individually  or in combination  could materially and adversely affect our business and the results of operations 
in  we took actions to address the effects of the economic crisis  including a reduction in force and the implementation of cost control and reduction efforts 
it is possible that we may need to take further cost control and reduction efforts 
we cannot predict whether these efforts will be sufficient to offset certain of the negative trends that might impact our business in or beyond 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market leading edge  cost effective products 
the power supply industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion for mature products  each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we fail to continue to develop and commercialize leading edge technologies and products that are cost effective and maintain high standards of quality  and introduce them to the market on a timely basis  our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our future operating results are dependent on the growth in our customers businesses and on our ability to identify and enter new markets 
we manufacture modular power components and power systems that are incorporated into our customers electronic products 
our growth is therefore dependent on the growth in the sales of our customers products as well as the development by our customers of new products 
if we fail to anticipate changes in our customers businesses and their changing product needs or successfully identify and enter new markets  our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted 
we cannot assure you that the markets we serve will grow in the future  that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets or that we can maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets 
a decline in demand in one or several of our end user markets could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and our results of operations 
if we were unable to use our manufacturing facility in andover  massachusetts  we would not be able to manufacture for an extended period of time 
all modular power components  whether for direct sale to customers or for sale to our subsidiaries and divisions for incorporation into their respective products  are manufactured at our andover  massachusetts production facility 
substantial damage to this facility due to fire  natural disaster  power loss or other events could interrupt manufacturing 
any prolonged inability to utilize all or a significant portion of this facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to procure necessary key components for our products  or we may purchase too much inventory or the wrong inventory 
the power supply industry  and the electronics industry as a whole  can be subject to business cycles 
during periods of growth  key components required to build our products may become unavailable in the timeframe required for us to meet our customers demands 
our inability to secure sufficient components to build products for our customers could negatively impact our sales and operating results 
we may choose to mitigate this risk by increasing the levels of inventory for certain key components 
increased inventory levels can increase the potential risk for excess and obsolescence should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers end markets 
if we purchase too much inventory or the wrong inventory  we may have to record additional inventory reserves or write off the inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and on our results of operations 
our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 
we have made significant additions to our manufacturing equipment and capacity over the past several years  including equipment for our new v i chip products 
we are currently adding equipment to the v i chip production line which we expect will more than double capacity once it is fully operational  which is anticipated to occur in the first half of if overall revenue levels do not increase enough to offset the increased fixed costs  or significant revenues do not materialize for the fpa products  or if there is deterioration in our overall business  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time  resulting in impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we rely on third party suppliers and subcontractors for components and assemblies and  therefore  cannot control their availability or quality 
we depend on third party suppliers and subcontractors to provide components and assemblies used in our products  some of which are sole sourced 
if suppliers or subcontractors cannot provide their products or services on time or to our specifications  we may not be able to meet the demand for our products and our delivery times may be negatively affected 
in addition  we cannot directly control the quality of the products and services provided by third parties 
in order to grow  we may need to find new or change existing suppliers and subcontractors 
this could cause disruptions in production  delays in the shipping of product or increases in prices paid to third parties 
we are exposed to economic  political and other risks through our foreign sales and distributors 
international sales have been and are expected to be a significant component of total sales 
dependence on foreign third parties for sales and distribution is subject to special risks  such as foreign economic and political instability  foreign currency controls and market fluctuations  trade barriers and tariffs  foreign regulations and exchange rates 
our international customers business may be negatively affected by the current crisis in the global credit and financial markets 
sudden or unexpected changes in the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be limited if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel 
our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our executive officers 
the loss of one or more members of senior management could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
in particular  we are dependent on the services of dr 
vinciarelli  our founder and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of dr 
vinciarelli could have a material adverse effect on our development of new products and on our results of operations 
in addition  we depend on highly skilled engineers and other personnel with technical skills that are in high demand and are difficult to replace 
our continued operations and growth depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel in a very competitive employment market 
if we are unable to attract and retain these employees  our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be harmed 
funds associated with our investments in auction rate securities may not be accessible in the short term 
as of december   we held  of auction rate securities at par value  consisting of collateralized debt obligations  supported by pools of student loans  sponsored by state student loan agencies and corporate student loan servicing firms 
the interest rates for these securities are reset at auction at regular intervals ranging from seven to days 
the auction rate securities held by us  prior to february  historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer 
on december   the majority of the auction rate securities held by us were aaa aaa rated by the major credit rating agencies  with all of the securities collateralized by student loans  of which most are guaranteed by the us department of education under the federal family education loan program 
until february  the auction rate securities market was liquid  as the investment banks conducting the periodic dutch auctions by which interest rates for the securities had been established had committed their capital to support such auctions in the event of insufficient third party investor demand 
starting the week of february   a substantial number of auctions failed  as demand from third party investors weakened and the investment banks conducting the auctions chose not to commit capital to support such auctions ie  investment banks chose not to purchase securities themselves in order to balance supply and demand  thereby facilitating a successful auction  as they had done in the past 
the consequences of a failed auction are a an investor must hold the specific security until the next scheduled auction unless that investor chooses to sell the security to a third party outside of the auction process and b the interest rate on the security generally resets to an interest rate set forth in each security s indenture 
while we do not currently anticipate the lack of liquidity of our auction rate securities to adversely affect our ability to conduct business  the funds associated with auction rate securities may not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the security is called  the underlying securities have matured  or  with respect to certain auction rate securities  we exercise of our contractual right to sell certain auction rate securities  at par value  during a period beginning june   to the broker dealer through which we purchased such securities 
we may be required to make additional adjustments to the carrying value of our auction rate securities 
in order to record the value of our auction rate securities appropriately each quarter  we have estimated their market value and recorded an impairment charge 
our available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  attributable to credit loss recorded through the statement of operations and unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  attributable to other non credit factors reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  a component of stockholders equity 
in determining the amount of credit loss  we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost basis of the securities  considering credit default risk probabilities and changes in credit ratings as significant inputs  among other factors 
our trading securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recognized through the statement of operations each reporting period 
we periodically evaluate if an investment is considered impaired  whether an impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the following circumstances  among others  may cause us to record such impairment charges to our consolidated statements of operations the default of an issuer or a specific security of that issuer  the significant deterioration of the credit rating of a security or its issuer  a tender offer for a specific security from the issuer valuing the security at less than par that is accepted by the number of holders necessary to require all holders to tender their securities  and the development of a robust secondary market for auction rate securities  establishing an active market value for our securities or similar securities that represents a substantial discount to par 
such impairment charges or  in the event of a sale  realized losses could be material in amount and be detrimental to our financial position  potentially impacting our ability to fund operations 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
we operate in an industry in which the ability to compete depends on the development or acquisition of proprietary technologies which must be protected to preserve the exclusive use of such technologies 
we devote substantial resources to establish and protect our patents and proprietary rights  and we rely on patent and intellectual property law to protect such rights 
this protection  however  may not prevent competitors from independently developing products similar or superior to our products 
we may be unable to protect or enforce current patents  may rely on unpatented technology that competitors could restrict  or may be unable to acquire patents in the future  and this may have a material adverse affect on our competitive position 
in addition  the intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as those of the united states 
we have been and may need to continue to defend or challenge patents 
we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs in and devote significant resources to these efforts which  if unsuccessful  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to resolve 
we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or manufacturing processes infringe on a third party s patent or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  we could be forced to either redesign or stop production of products incorporating that technology  and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to defend us against claims of infringement  and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of key personnel 
an adverse outcome in these types of matters could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations and financial condition 
we may face legal claims and litigation that could be costly to resolve 
we may in the future encounter legal action from customers  vendors or others concerning product warranty or other claims 
such litigation is costly and diverts the attention of key personnel 
an adverse outcome in these current or future matters could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations and financial condition

the following table sets forth certain items of selected consolidated financial information as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
this table and the subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained elsewhere in this report 
year ended december  as adjusted as adjusted net revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income loss before income taxes critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
as described in notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted the new accounting standard for noncontrolling interests and changed the reporting for minority interests  which are now characterized as noncontrolling interests as of january  management believes the following accounting policies involve its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in this form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  based on assessments of customers credit risk profiles and payment histories 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we employ a variety of methodologies to estimate allowances for its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  based upon its known backlog and historical usage  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
for bbu products produced at our andover facility  our principal manufacturing location  the model used is based upon a comparison of on hand quantities to projected demand  such that amounts of inventory on hand in excess of a three year projected usage are fully reserved 
since v i chip products are at a relatively early stage  a one year projected usage assumption is used 
while we have used our best efforts and believe we have used the best available information to estimate future demand  due to uncertainty in the economy and our business and the inherent difficulty in predicting future demand  it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
fair value measurements we account for certain financial assets at fair value  defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
if management made different assumptions or judgments  material differences in fair values could occur 
short term and long term investments our short term and long term investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  attributable to credit loss recorded through the statement of operations and unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  attributable to other non credit factors reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  a component of total equity 
in determining the amount of credit loss  we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost basis of the securities  considering credit default risks probabilities and changes in credit ratings as significant inputs  among other factors 
trading securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recognized through the statement of operations each reporting period 
we periodically evaluate if an investment is considered impaired  whether an impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
we consider a variety of impairment indicators such as  but not limited to  a significant deterioration in the earnings performance  credit rating  or asset quality of the investment 
as of december   we held  of auction rate securities at par value  consisting of collateralized debt obligations  supported by pools of student loans  sponsored by state student loan agencies and corporate student loan servicing firms 
the interest rates for these securities are reset at auction at regular intervals ranging from seven to ninety days 
the auction rate securities held by us  prior to february  historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer 
on december   the majority of the auction rate securities we held were aaa aaa rated by the major credit rating agencies  with all of the securities collateralized by student loans  of which most are guaranteed by the us department of education under the federal family education loan program 
until february  the auction rate securities market was liquid  as the investment banks conducting the periodic dutch auctions by which interest rates for the securities had been established had committed their capital to support such auctions in the event of insufficient third party investor demand 
starting the week of february   a substantial number of auctions failed  as demand from third party investors weakened and the investment banks conducting the auctions chose not to commit capital to support such auctions ie  investment banks chose not to purchase securities themselves in order to balance supply and demand  thereby facilitating a successful auction  as they had done in the past 
the consequences of a failed auction are a an investor must hold the specific security until the next scheduled auction unless that investor chooses to sell the security to a third party outside of the auction process and b the interest rate on the security generally resets to an interest rate set forth in each security s indenture 
as of december   we held auction rate securities that had experienced failed auctions totaling  at par value the failed auction securities  of which  was redeemed at par subsequent to december  management is not aware of any reason to believe any of the issues of the failed auction securities we hold are presently at risk of default 
through december   we have continued to receive interest payments on the failed auction securities in accordance with their terms 
we believe that all of our auction rate security investments will ultimately be liquidated without significant loss primarily due to the overall quality of the issues held and the collateral securing the substantial majority of the underlying obligations 
however  current conditions in the auction rate securities market have led us to conclude the recovery period for the failed auction securities exceeds months 
as a result  we continued to classify the failed auction securities as long term as of december   except for the  redeemed at par subsequent to december   which was reclassified as short term 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs ag ubs regarding  of auction rate securities at par value that we held with a broker dealer affiliate of ubs the ubs ars  of which  have subsequently been redeemed at par 
the agreement provides us a contractual right the ars right that entitles us to sell the auction rate securities it holds with ubs to ubs at par during the period of june  through july  until then  we are entitled to receive interest payments on our auction rate securities in accordance with their terms 
the terms and conditions of the settlement include a release of claims against ubs and its affiliates 
the ars right is a separate free standing instrument accounted for separately from the ubs ars and is accounted for as a purchased put option 
we elected fair value accounting for the ars right 
the election was made to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by accounting for the receipt of the ars right and the underlying auction rate securities under different methods 
the remaining balance of our auction rate securities  classified as available for sale securities  is held with a broker dealer affiliate of bank of america the bofa ars 
while the failed auction securities are all highly rated investments  continued failure to sell at their reset dates  changes in the market conditions or declines in credit ratings could negatively impact the carrying value of the investments  in turn leading to impairment charges in future periods 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
we periodically assess the remaining use of fixed assets based upon operating results and cash flows from operations 
equipment has been written down as a result of these assessments as necessary 
goodwill is tested for potential impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the relevant service period 
we estimate the fair value of each stock based award on the measurement date using either the current market price or the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility  the expected life of options  forfeiture rate  a risk free interest rate and dividend yields 
many of these assumptions are highly subjective and require the exercise of management judgment 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the amount of stock based compensation would occur 
product warranties we generally warrant our products for a period of two years 
we maintain allowances for estimated product returns under warranty based upon a review of known or potential product failures in the field and upon historical patterns of product returns 
if unforeseen product issues arise or product returns increase above expected rates  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have assessed the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance for a significant portion of the deferred tax assets is warranted on december  in reaching this conclusion  we evaluated all relevant criteria  including the existence of significant temporary differences reversing in the carryforward period 
the valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences  changes in tax laws  and operating performance 
in addition  the assessment of the valuation allowance requires us to make estimates of future taxable income and to estimate reversals of temporary differences 
changes in the assumptions or other circumstances may require additional valuation allowances if actual reversals of temporary differences differ from those estimates 
we follow a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize in our financial statements 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if the tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold then it is not recognized in the financial statements 
we accrue interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
if the judgments and estimates made by us are not correct  the unrecognized tax benefits may have to be adjusted  and the adjustments could be material 
contingencies from time to time  we receive notices of product failure claims  infringement of patent or intellectual property rights of others or for other claims 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded 
in making this assessment  we may consult  depending on the nature of the matter  with external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable  we record a loss 
in determining the amount of the loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  if any  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position

in november  we entered into a settlement agreement with ubs regarding  of failed auction securities  at par value  we held with a broker dealer affiliate of ubs 
this settlement provides us with a contractual right by which we may sell the failed auction securities held with ubs to ubs at par during the period of june  through july  until then  we remain entitled to receive interest payments on the securities in accordance with their terms 
the terms and conditions of the settlement include a release of claims against ubs and its affiliates 
the right is a separate freestanding instrument accounted for separately from the ubs ars and is being accounted for as a purchased put option 
we elected fair value accounting for the right 
we made this election to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by accounting for the receipt of the right and the underlying securities under different methods 
the right was initially recorded at a fair value of approximately  with the offset recorded as an unrealized gain in other income expense  net 
because we entered into this agreement with ubs  the total amount of the failed auction securities previously reported as available for sale have been reclassified as trading securities 
based on the fair value measurements described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we estimated the fair value of the failed auction securities held with ubs on december  to be approximately  compared with a par value of  the difference of  has been recorded as an unrealized loss in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations

net income of noncontrolling interest increased  to  in from  for this was due to higher net income at certain entities in which we hold a noncontrolling interest 
basic and diluted income loss per share attributable to vicor corporation was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources due to the current economic environment  we have assessed our overall liquidity position and have taken substantive steps to preserve cash and reduce expenses 
in the first quarter of  we announced an indefinite suspension of our dividend and reduced our workforce by approximately eight percent 
additional workforce reductions were implemented in the second and third quarters of at december   we had  in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  working capital increased  to  at december  from  at december  the primary factors affecting the working capital increase were increases in cash and cash equivalents of  other current assets of  short term investments of  a decrease in income taxes payable of  and accrued compensation and benefits of  offset by increases in accounts payable of  deferred revenue of  and accrued severance charge of  as well as decreases in inventories of  and accounts receivable of  the primary source of cash for the year ended december   was  from operating activities and  in net sales of short term and long term investments 
the primary use of cash for the year ended december  was  for the purchase of equipment and  for the payments of dividends  discussed below 
as of december   we held  of auction rate securities classified as long term investments and  classified as short term investments 
please see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the securities and our accounting treatment thereof 
in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  of common stock the november plan 
the november plan authorizes us to make such repurchases from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amounts of stock repurchases are at the discretion of management based on its view of economic and financial market conditions 
we did not repurchase shares of common stock during the year ended december  as of december   we had approximately  remaining under the november plan 
during the year ending december   two subsidiaries paid a total of  in dividends  of which  was paid to outside shareholders and accounted for as a reduction in noncontrolling interest 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we also have a contract with a third party to supply nitrogen for our manufacturing and research and development activities 
under the contract  we are obligated to pay a minimum of  annually  subject to semi annual price adjustments  through march in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  approximately  of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
related to these unrecognized tax benefits  we have also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of approximately  on december  our primary liquidity needs are for making continuing investments in manufacturing equipment  particularly equipment to increase capacity for our v i chip products 
we believe cash generated from operations and the total of its cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund planned operations and capital equipment purchases for the foreseeable future 
we have approximately  of capital expenditure commitments  principally for manufacturing equipment  as of december  based on our ability to access cash and other short term investments and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of our auction rate securities will affect our ability to execute our current operating plan 
we do not consider the impact of inflation and changing prices on our business activities or fluctuations in the exchange rates for foreign currency transactions to have been significant during the last three fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as our cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities  which are short term in nature  we believe our exposure to market risk on interest rate fluctuations for these investments is not significant 
our short term and long term investments consist mainly of municipal and corporate debt securities  of which the failed auction securities represent a significant portion 
while the failed auction securities are all highly rated investments  generally with aaa aaa ratings  continued failure to sell at their reset dates could negatively impact the carrying value of the investments  in turn leading to impairment charges in future periods 
currently  changes in the fair value of the failed auction securities held with ubs are recorded through earnings 
changes in the fair value of the failed auction securities held with bofa attributable to credit loss are recorded through earnings  with the remainder of any change recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
should a decline in the value of the failed auction securities held with bofa be other than temporary  the losses would be recorded in other income expense  net 
we do not believe there was an other than temporary decline in value in these securities as of december  we estimate that our annual interest income would change by approximately  in for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
our exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the operations of vjcl and changes in the dollar yen exchange rate  as the functional currency of our subsidiaries in europe and hong kong is the us dollar 
therefore  we believes market risk is mitigated since these operations are not materially exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations 
relative to foreign currency exposure against the yen existing on december   we estimate that a unfavorable movement in the dollar yen exchange rate would increase foreign currency loss by approximately
