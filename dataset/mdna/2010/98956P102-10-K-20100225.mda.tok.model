item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a global leader in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive implants  dental implants  spinal implants  trauma products and related surgical products sometimes referred to in this report as osp 
we also provide other healthcare related services 
we have operations in more than countries and market products in more than countries 
we manage operations through three reportable geographic segments the americas  europe and asia pacific 
certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes 
certain amounts in the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
beginning in  we no longer include our dental product category sales within our reconstructive products category 
amounts in the years ended december  and related to sales of dental products have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  demand volume and mix trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed percentage points of sales growth  which is percentage point below the rate of growth from compared to we believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume temporarily decelerated from mid single digit growth rates to low single digit growth rates on a global basis due to the weakened global economy 
we believe long term market growth rates will be driven by an aging global population  obesity  proven clinical benefits  new material technologies  advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles  among other factors 
in addition  the ongoing shift in demand to premium products  such as longevity and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes  trabecular metal technology products  hip stems with kinectiv technology  high flex knees  knee revision products  porous hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices continues to positively affect sales growth 
our percentage points of sales growth in from volume and changes in mix decreased from and was lower than market growth due to the impact of the disruptive events discussed below 
pricing trends global selling prices decreased percent during compared to flat pricing in selling prices in the americas decreased percent during the year ended december   compared to flat pricing in the same period 
europe selling prices were flat for the year ended december   which is similar to the period 
asia pacific selling prices decreased percent for the year ended december   compared to a percent decrease in the same period  as we anniversaried out of scheduled reductions in reimbursement prices in japan 
with the effect of governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems  we expect selling prices to decrease approximately to percent on a global basis for foreign currency exchange rates for  foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a percent decline in sales 
if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with year end rates  we estimate that a weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in of approximately percent on sales 
we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities  and  under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization  through the use of forward contracts and options solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk 
changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth  but due to offsetting gains losses on hedge contracts and options  which are recorded in cost of products sold  the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 
disruptive events we suffered customer losses as a result of disruptive factors experienced during  including the implementation of our enhanced global compliance initiatives  our temporary suspension of us marketing and distribution of the durom cup and our voluntary recall and suspension of production of certain osp patient care products 
we estimate that these customer losses reduced our global knee market share by approximately percent and hip market share by approximately percent on a cumulative basis through the end of these share losses affected sales growth in  especially in the first six to nine months of the year  but stabilized as we concluded the year 
global economic conditions we believe adverse conditions in the broader economy have resulted in a slowdown in elective hospital procedures 
we saw evidence of recovery in  although the large developed countries in europe appear to be lagging the us and japan 
although many of our products are used in elective procedures  we believe our core knee and hip franchises remain more insulated than many medical product categories from swings in the broader economy because the need for these procedures does not diminish  even if the 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report timing is affected 
in particular  our dental revenues have experienced pressure due to the weak economic environment as many of those procedures are not reimbursed by third party payors 
outlook in the second half of  we saw encouraging signs that orthopaedic procedure volumes in certain markets were recovering 
our market assumptions are that in knee and hip procedures will grow in mid single digits within the americas and asia pacific markets  and remain flat to slightly positive in the large developed markets in europe 
given the expected pacing of our new product launches  such as the zimmer mmc cup  continuum acetabular system and zimmer patient specific instruments  we anticipate our sales growth in to be greater in the second half of the year 
we expect to continue making investments in r d in the range of to percent of sales 
assuming currency rates remain at year end levels  we expect our gross margin to be approximately percent of sales in this takes into account the higher cost inventory we carry into as well as projected foreign currency hedge losses partially offset by lower anticipated excess and obsolete inventory charges in we expect the gross margin ratio to be slightly lower in the first half of as compared to the second half of the year 
sg a as a percent of sales is expected to decrease for the full year as we restore leverage from revenue growth offset  in part  by sales and marketing investments in support of new product launches 
we have completed the infrastructure investment projects in eschbach  germany  our automated  centralized distribution facility for the europe  middle east and africa region  and in shannon  ireland  our new implant manufacturing facility 
both facilities are now operational and should provide economic benefits for the full year we expect interest expense will be unfavorable year over year due to the billion senior notes offering we completed in the fourth quarter of the impact of this expense on our diluted earnings per share should be more than offset by the additional shares we repurchased with a portion of the proceeds from the notes offering

in addition  the gender solutions natural knee flex system made a strong contribution 
in europe  changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected knee sales by percent 
hips the continued conversion to porous stems  including the zimmer m l taper stem  the zimmer m l taper stem with kinectiv technology  the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweym ller hip stem  led hip stem sales  but those sales were partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems 
trabecular metal acetabular cups and longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners also made strong contributions 
in the us hip market  we had some product gaps related to our acetabular cups which have affected sales growth 
this was most noticeable in the area of metal on metal articulation 
in november  the continuum acetabular system and the zimmer mmc cup were cleared for sale in the us these systems give surgeons a comprehensive array of acetabular cup solutions that  in concert with our comprehensive stem portfolio  provide additional patient matching options 
these cups have also received approval in various countries outside the us and will help complete our product portfolios in those countries as well 
in europe  changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected hip sales by percent 
in asia pacific  changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales by percent 
extremities the bigliani flatow complete shoulder solution and the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system led extremities sales 
trabecular metal technology is playing a critical role in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding extremities market 
dental the tapered screw vent implant system led dental sales 
negative sales growth for our dental business reflects overall weakness in the global economy 
we continue to believe the dental market will rebound as the global economy recovers and look forward to new opportunities as our product line is expanded through internal and external development efforts 
trauma zimmer periarticular locking plates and the itst intertrochanteric subtrochanteric fixation system led trauma sales but were partially offset by declining sales of compression hip screws 
femoral and tibial nails within the new zimmer natural nail system also made a contribution during the year 
spine in the fourth quarter of  we acquired abbott spine 
as a result of the acquisition  spine sales have increased but the increase is offset in part by sales losses associated with the integration of the business 
solid sales of acquired fusion devices as well as legacy interbody devices and bone graft substitutes partly offset a significant decline in sales of the dynesys dynamic stabilization system during the year 
we expect our spinal business will continue to experience reimbursement challenges related to the dynesys system 
following the november non approvable recommendation by the fda advisory panel of our request for additional approved uses for the dynesys system  we are exploring our options  which are presently uncertain 
we believe that we generally have a solid portfolio of spine products as well as broad global distribution capabilities that should lead to improved performance over time 
osp and other osp sales were led by palacos bone cement 
osp product sales growth improved in the second half of due to the effect of anniversarying out of the voluntary suspension and recall of certain products during and by the reintroduction of wound debridement products in

selling  general and administrative expense  or sg a  increased to  million in  from  million in this is an increase of approximately basis points compared to the prior year 
sg a expense in the period included approximately million of incremental costs  such as monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated with the global roll out of our enhanced compliance program 
the savings from these costs in have been offset by increased spending to fund enhanced medical education programs  abbott spine costs and increased product liability claims 
in this challenging economic environment  we are carefully managing our sg a spend  reducing expenses in certain areas in order to fund growth and productivity initiatives 
areas of investment include marketing and promotion and medical education and training 
the acquisition of abbott spine increased sg a costs for items such as selling expenses  increased instrument depreciation and amortization of the acquired intangible assets 
additionally  sg a as a percentage of net sales is negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues caused by changes in foreign currency rates 
a majority of our sg a spend is incurred in the us  primarily from our corporate headquarters and similar functions at our various businesses such as dental  trauma  spine and osp 
therefore  sg a expense does not respond to changes in foreign currency rates proportionally to our revenue  which has caused sg a as a percentage of net sales to increase 
certain claims expense is a provision for estimated durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries within specified times

for more information regarding these claims  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of  we noted that the carrying value of the assets of our us spine reporting unit was in excess of its estimated fair value 
as a result  we recorded a related goodwill impairment charge of million during the year ended december  for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them 
we estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
for each of those five reporting units  the estimated fair value substantially exceeds its carrying value

the resolution of outstanding payments to healthcare professionals and institutions resulted in increased cash outflows during the period compared to the delay in similar payments during the period as we implemented our enhanced global compliance program 
the resolution of these outstanding payments  along with a change in the timing of employee bonus payments compared to the period and product liability payments  contributed to increased outflows from accrued expenses in these outflows were partially offset by improved accounts receivable collections and better inventory management 
at december   we had days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable  a decrease of days when compared to december   reflecting improved collections across all geographic segments 
at december   we had days of inventory on hand  a decrease of days compared to december  over the past two years we have made significant investments in inventory  including investments in response to growing demand for systems that provide more versatility and better fit for patients 
in we made progress rationalizing these investments through reductions in field based consignments and through the use of new inventory management tools to speed returns and redeployments 
the continued build out of pipeline inventory for planned product launches should partially offset these reductions in field consignments in cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in additions to instruments decreased in compared to the period  as year over year spending on instruments declined compared to the significant investments made in in  we expect to spend approximately million on instruments to support new products and sales growth

we may use excess cash or further borrow against our senior credit facility  subject to limits set by our board of directors  to repurchase additional common stock under the billion program which expires december  approximately million remains authorized for future repurchases under this plan 
management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs 
should investment opportunities arise  we believe that our earnings  balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital  if necessary 
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments 
the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions and and and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt interest payments operating leases purchase obligations long term income taxes payable other long term liabilities total contractual obligations critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
excess inventory and instruments we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost 
similarly  we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply 
reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of reserves  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components 
the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory  which is recorded at cost 
obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including existing tax laws  our experience with previous settlement agreements  the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
during  in addition to our general product liability estimates and the million provision recorded in related to the durom cup  we recorded an additional provision for certain claims of million representing management s updated estimate of liability to durom cup patients undergoing revisions associated with surgeries occurring before july and within two years of the original surgery date 
these parameters are consistent with our data which indicates that cup loosenings associated with surgical technique are most likely to occur within that time period 
we expect to pay the majority of these claims within the next three years 
any claims received outside of these defined parameters will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard product liability accruals 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets 
as such  these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs 
changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined our us spine reporting unit s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value 
fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches 
fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
fair value under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction methodology  which uses valuation indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit 
factors that contributed to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit being below its carrying value included a decrease in projected revenues related to the dynesys dynamic stabilization system 
this product line experienced increased competition and insurance reimbursement issues in we have been seeking approval from the fda to market this product differently in the us  which would enhance its position in the market 
however  in november an fda advisory panel issued a non approvable recommendation  increasing the uncertainty of the estimated future cash flows 
in addition to the dynesys product  revenues from other products have been affected as we work through the integration of the sales channel following the abbott spine acquisition 
as a result  we recorded a related goodwill impairment charge of million during the year ended december  we have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them 
we estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
for each of those five reporting units  the estimated fair value substantially exceeds its carrying value 
share based payment we measure share based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock 
additionally  we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options 
the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors 
the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management s best estimates

we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars  korean won and swedish krona 
we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions 
these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 
for contracts outstanding at december   we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars  korean won and swedish krona and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january through june the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the weighted average contract rates outstanding are euro usd  usd swiss franc  usd japanese yen  british pound usd  usd canadian dollar  australian dollar usd  usd korean won  and usd swedish krona 
we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities 
our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december  indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar  korean won and swedish krona  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through  depending on the direction of the change  by an average approximate amount of million  million  million  million  million  million  million and million for the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar  korean won and swedish krona contracts  respectively 
any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately  million at december   primarily in swiss francs  japanese yen and euros 
approximately  million of the net asset exposure at december  relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
as a result  foreign currency remeasurement gains losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 
commodity price risk we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  polymer and sterile packaging 
we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of to months  where available  on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a

form k annual report material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 
presently  we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in us government treasury funds and bank deposits 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities 
our senior notes have fixed interest rates and are not exposed to any risk from movement in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and our uncommitted credit facilities 
presently  all of our debt outstanding under the senior credit facility bears interest at short term rates 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure  but we may do so in the future 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  would not have a material effect on interest expense 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash  cash equivalents  counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 
we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation 
we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines 
we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
however  essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and  accordingly  are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures  and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk
