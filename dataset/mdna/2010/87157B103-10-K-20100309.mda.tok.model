revenues we generate a substantial portion of our revenues on a per transaction basis  most of which is derived from contracts that extend up to months from execution 
for the years ended december  and  we derived approximately of our revenues from transactions processed 
in  similar to previous years  most of the remainder of our revenues were generated by professional services 
historically  our revenues have been directly impacted by the number of transactions processed 
in recent years  the fourth quarter has had the highest volume of transactions processed due to increased consumer activation activity during the holiday season 
the future success of our business depends on the continued growth of consumer and business transactions and  as such  the volume of transactions that we process could fluctuate on a quarterly basis

costs and expenses our costs and expenses consist of cost of services  research and development  selling  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services includes all direct materials  direct labor  cost of facilities and those indirect costs related to revenues such as indirect labor  materials and supplies 
our primary cost of services is related to our information technology and systems department  including network costs  data center maintenance  database management and data processing costs  as well as personnel costs associated with service implementation  customer deployment and customer care 
also included in cost of services are costs associated with our exception handling centers and the maintenance of those centers 
currently  we utilize a combination of employees and third party providers to process transactions through these centers 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred unless they meet gaap criteria for deferral and amortization 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility do not meet these criteria  and are expensed as incurred 
research and development expense consists primarily of costs related to personnel  including salaries and other personnel related expenses  consulting fees and the cost of facilities  computer and support services used in service technology development 
we also expense costs relating to developing modifications and minor enhancements of our existing technology and services 
selling expense consists of personnel costs including salaries  sales commissions  sales operations and other personnel related expense  travel and related expense  trade shows  costs of communications equipment and support services  facilities costs  consulting fees and costs of marketing programs  such as internet and print 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expense for our executive  administrative  legal  finance and human resources functions  facilities  professional services fees  certain audit  tax and bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization relates to our property and equipment and includes our network infrastructure and facilities 
amortization relates to the customer lists and technology acquired from wisor telecom corporation wisor in current trends affecting our results of operations our on demand business model enables delivery of our proprietary solutions over the web as a service and has been driven by market trends such as various forms of order provisioning  local number portability  the implementation of new technologies  subscriber growth  competitive churn  network changes  growth of the emerging device market ie  smartphone devices  netbooks  etc 
and consolidations in the industry 
in particular  the emergence of order provisioning of e commerce transactions for smartphone devices  wireless  voip  lnp  and other communication services surrounding the convergence of bundled services has increased the need for our services and we believe will continue to be a source of growth for us 
to support the growth driven by the favorable industry trends mentioned above  we continue to look for opportunities to improve our operating efficiencies  such as the utilization of offshore technical and non technical resources for our exception handling center management 
we believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us to support revenue growth 
in addition  we anticipate further automation of the transactions generated by our more mature customers and additional transaction types 
our cost of services can fluctuate from period to period based upon the level of automation and the on boarding of new transaction types 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  correct and reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue we provide services principally on a transactional basis or  at times  on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenues as the services are performed or delivered as discussed below transactional service arrangements transaction revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through our service platforms and represented approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
transaction service arrangements include services such as equipment orders  new account set up and activation  number port requests  credit checks and inventory management 
transaction revenues are principally based on a set price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period 
revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract 
the total amount of revenues recognized is based primarily on the volume of transactions 
in many cases as the automation rates increase  transaction costs for our customer decreases 
many of our contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer 
in these instances  if the customer s total transaction volume for the period is less than the contractual amount  we record revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount 
at times  transaction revenues may also include billings to customers based on the number of individuals dedicated to processing transactions 
set up fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract since these amounts would not have been paid by the customer without the related transactional service arrangement 
revenues are presented net of discounts  which are volume level driven  or credits  which are performance driven  and are determined in the period in which the volume thresholds are met or the services are provided 
professional service arrangements professional service revenues represented approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
professional services  when sold with transactional service arrangements  are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the professional services 
when accounted for separately  professional service revenues are recognized on a monthly basis  as services are performed and all other elements of revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from transaction service revenues  we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the professional services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists of the undelivered elements  the nature of the professional services  the timing of when the professional contract was signed in 
table of contents comparison to the transaction service start date and the contractual independence of the transactional service from the professional services 
if a professional service arrangement were not to qualify for separate accounting  we would recognize the professional service revenues ratably over the remaining term of the transaction contract 
there were no such arrangements for the years ended december   and subscription service arrangements subscription service arrangements represented approximately of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  and relate principally to our activationnow platform service which the customer accesses through a graphical user interface 
we record revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract for our subscription service contracts 
deferred revenue deferred revenues primarily represent billings to customers for services in advance of the performance of services  with revenues recognized as the services are rendered  and also includes the fair value of deferred revenues recorded as a result of the wisor acquisition 
service level standards pursuant to certain contracts  we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
all performance related penalties are reflected as a corresponding reduction of our revenues 
these penalties  if applicable  are recorded in the month incurred and were not significant for the years ended december   and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance account is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balance outstanding 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit losses that we have in the past or that our reserves will be adequate 
if the financial condition of one of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in its inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional expense in the period that this determination was made 
income taxes we account for the effects of income taxes that result from our activities during the current and preceding years 
under this method  deferred income tax liabilities and assets based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   and we had total unrecognized tax benefit reserves of and which includes and for interest related to uncertain positions  respectively 
components of the reserve are classified as either current or long term in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
accordingly  we recorded a long term liability for unrecognized tax benefits of on the balance sheet at december  that would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized 
we record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain income tax positions below the operating income line as a component of interest expense 
tax returns for years and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities 
in  the net increase in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was and the net increase for interest expense was we expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during fiscal year  however  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
while we believe we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is also possible that 
table of contents changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserve 
stock based compensation as of december   we maintain two stock based compensation plans 
compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted and is based on the grant date fair value estimated using the weighted average assumption of the black scholes option pricing models 
the equity instrument is not considered to be issued until the instrument vests 
as a result  compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid in capital 
compensation expense also includes the amortization on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of the intrinsic values of the stock options granted prior to we classify benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow with a corresponding operating cash outflow 
we included  million and million of excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility was calculated based on a blended weighted average of historical information of similar public entities for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use this approach using other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life was determined using the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common or preferred equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior  as well as a historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows for the year ended december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options in years expected dividend yield the weighted average fair value as of the date of grant of the options granted was  and per share for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the total stock based compensation cost related to non vested equity awards not yet recognized as an expense as of december  was approximately million 
during october  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved amendments to stock options held by certain employees to permit transferability of such options to family members 
as a result of the amendments  options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock no longer qualify as incentive stock options under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
accordingly  we treated the amended stock options as if they were non qualified stock options since inception  which resulted in a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
also  there was no incremental compensation cost associated with each amended stock option resulting from the measurement of the excess of the fair value of the stock option immediately following its amendment over the fair value of the stock option immediately prior to its amendment based on the share price and other pertinent factors at that date 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  including other definite lived intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized  but reviewed annually for impairment or upon the 
table of contents occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we performed our annual impairment test noting no impairment  and we do not believe we are at risk for impairment

this decrease in cost of services corresponds to the decrease in revenue for the period due primarily to the declining volume associated with activation of iphones on at t s network 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in repairs and maintenance of million and an increase in stock based compensation expense of million  compared to cost of services as a percentage of net revenues increased for  as compared to for  due principally to fewer automated transactions as compared to the prior year

accordingly  quarterly amounts do not add to the annual amount because of differences in the weighted average common shares outstanding during each period principally due to the effect of the company s issuing shares of its common stock and options during the year 
gross profit is defined as net revenues less cost of services and excludes depreciation and amortization expense 
net income for the quarter ended december  included a tax benefit resulting from the amendment of  shares of the company s incentive stock options 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by operations 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was million at december   an increase of million as compared to the end of this increase was due to cash provided by operations offset by acquisitions of fixed assets associated with our new facilities 
we anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be to fund the expansion of our business through both organic growth as well as possible acquisition activities and to expand our 
table of contents customer base internationally 
uses of cash will also include facility expansion  capital expenditures and working capital 
in may  we initiated a stock repurchase program that  as of december   repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the purchases were funded from available working capital 
there were no shares repurchased for year ended december  in may  we entered into an agreement to lease space for our pennsylvania offices and data center in a newly constructed facility 
the lease has a term of years and months with an option to extend the term of the lease for two consecutive five year periods 
in august  we amended the lease whereby we agreed to reimburse the landlord for certain leasehold improvements we had requested 
the construction phase of the building was complete as of june  since the tenant improvements  under the lease amendment  are considered structural in nature and we are responsible for reimbursement to the landlord for the cost of these improvements we are considered to be the owner of the construction project for accounting purposes 
we recorded assets on our balance sheet for all of the costs paid by the lessor to construct the pennsylvania facility through december   along with corresponding financing liabilities for amounts equal to these lessor paid construction costs through december  post construction period accounting requires determination of a portion of the monthly lease payments to be construed as interest  depreciation  and principal payments 
at december   we had recorded million of construction costs funded by the landlord  with an offsetting amount recorded as financing liabilities 
the lease did not qualify for a sale lease back treatment and therefore the lease was treated as a financing lease 
for the year ended december   we recorded million and million of interest expense and depreciation expense  respectively  related to the lease agreement 
discussion of cash flows year ended december   compared to the year ended december  cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is primarily due to an increase to net income  accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred revenue balance partially offset by an increase to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the accounts payable and accrued expenses accounts grew partially due to increased expenses necessary to support higher revenues as well as the up front costs associated with the design  business process flow and planning related to the on boarding of new business channels within our existing customers 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased set up fees associated with new customer contracts 
cash flows from investing 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to net cash used of million in the decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of wisor in offset by a net increase in leasehold improvements and fixed asset acquisitions in primarily associated with the move to our new facilities in pennsylvania and bangalore  india cash flows from financing 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash used by financing activities of million for the year ended december  in may  we initiated a stock repurchase program and during the year ended december   repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
there were no shares repurchased during the year ended december  the remaining difference was due to increased net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million through the exercise of stock options  increased tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and the amendment of certain incentive stock options of million offset by increased payments of the long term lease obligations associated with the pennsylvania facility of approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 

table of contents year ended december   compared to the year ended december  cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is primarily due to a decrease to accounts receivable of million due to lower revenues in and partially offset by a decrease to accrued expenses  a decrease to accounts payable and a decrease to net income of million from cash flows from investing 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to net cash used of million in the increase of million was primarily due to the million net cash outflow for the acquisition of wisor and a net change in investments of marketable securities of million partially offset by decreased purchases of fixed assets of million 
expenditures related to fixed assets in were higher than due to increased spending to support customer initiatives that required a higher volume of transactions 
cash flows from financing 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in in may  we initiated a stock repurchase program and repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the remaining difference was due to decreased net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million through the exercise of stock options  decreased tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options of million and decreased repayments of an equipment loan of approximately million 
effect of inflation although inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment  we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during  and contractual obligations our commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space  automobiles  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term lease obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total amount represents obligation associated with the pennsylvania facility lease

although the timing of the settlement is uncertain  we believe this amount will be settled within years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
this standard provides principles for allocation of consideration among its multiple elements  allowing more flexibility in identifying and accounting for separate deliverables under an arrangement 
asu no 
introduces an estimated selling price method for valuing the elements of a bundled arrangement if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price is not available  and significantly expands related disclosure requirements 
this standard is effective on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  alternatively  adoption may be on a retrospective basis  and early application is 
table of contents permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we deposit our excess cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds and certificates of deposit and  we may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our marketable securities  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
we do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of securities  which could include commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  and were invested in liquid money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
the year began amidst the backdrop of unprecedented significant economic disruptions in the financial markets and challenging economic conditions that have adversely affected the united states and world economies 
investors in many industry sectors have experienced substantial decreases in asset valuations and uncertain market liquidity 
furthermore  credit rating authorities have  in many cases  been slow to respond to the rapid changes in the underlying value of certain securities and pervasive market illiquidity  regarding these securities 
there can be no assurances that the issues surrounding the financial markets will not worsen or potentially impact the determination of the fair value of financial instruments or possibly require impairments in the future should the value of certain investments suffer a decline in value which is determined to be other than temporary 
we currently do not believe any change in the market value of our money market funds or other investments to be material or warrant a change in valuation
