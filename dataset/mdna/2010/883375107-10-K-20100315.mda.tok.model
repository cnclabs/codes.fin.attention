item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview theragenics corporation is a medical device company serving the surgical products and cancer treatment markets  operating in two business segments 
the terms company  we  us  or our mean theragenics corporation and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements 
our surgical products business consists of wound closure  vascular access  and specialty needle products 
wound closure includes sutures  needles and other surgical products 
vascular access includes introducers  guidewires  and related products 
specialty needles include coaxial  biopsy  spinal and disposable veress needles  access trocars  and other needle based products 
this segment serves a number of markets and applications  including among other areas  interventional cardiology  interventional radiology  vascular surgery  orthopedics  plastic surgery  dental surgery  urology  veterinary medicine  pain management  endoscopy  and spinal surgery 
our surgical products business sells its devices and components primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems and to a network of distributors 
in our brachytherapy seed business  we produce  market and sell theraseed  our premier palladium prostate cancer treatment device  i seed  our iodine based prostate cancer treatment device  and other related products and services 
we are the world s largest producer of palladium  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for our theraseed device 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed device 
the majority of theraseed sales are channeled through third party distributors 
we also maintain an in house sales force that sells our theraseed and i seed devices directly to physicians 
we have substantially diversified our operations and revenues in recent years 
in may  we expanded into the surgical products business with the acquisition of cp medical corporation cp medical 
in august  we restructured our brachytherapy seed business to sharpen our focus on our two business segments and provide a more focused platform for continued diversification 
in august  we acquired galt medical corp 
galt  and in july  we acquired needletech products  inc needletech 
cp medical  galt  and needletech comprise our surgical products business  which accounted for of consolidated revenue in prior to may  the brachytherapy seed business constituted of our revenue 
new credit agreement in may  we executed an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with a financial institution 
the credit agreement provides for up to million of borrowings under a revolving credit facility the revolver and a million term loan the term loan  payable in equal monthly installments over three years 
this new credit agreement replaced our prior credit agreement which had a maturity date of october see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information 
acquisition of needletech products in we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of needletech on july  the total purchase price  including transaction costs  was approximately million net of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities acquired with an estimated fair value of approximately million 
the purchase price was paid in cash  including million from borrowings under our million credit facility 
needletech is a manufacturer of specialty needles and related medical devices 
needletech s current products include coaxial needles  biopsy needles  access trocars  brachytherapy needles  guidewire introducer needles  spinal needles  disposable veress needles  and other needle based products 
end markets served include cardiology  orthopedics  pain management  endoscopy  spinal surgery  urology  and veterinary medicine 
this transaction provided further diversification in our surgical products business and allowed us to leverage our existing strengths within these markets 
the acquisition of needletech is designed to forward our stated strategy of becoming a diversified medical device manufacturer  increase our breadth of offerings to existing customers  and expand our customer base of large leading edge original equipment manufacturers 
we accounted for the acquisition of needletech under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition  with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 
results of operations of needletech were included for the period subsequent to the acquisition date 
ii results of operations change in segment reporting we changed the manner in which we allocate the cost of corporate activities to our business segments during operating expenses associated with corporate activities are now allocated based on the relative revenue of each business segment 
with the acquisition of needletech in july  the continued integration of acquired companies  the launch of our r d program for our surgical products segment in late  and our program to standardize our information technology systems across all of our businesses  among other things  we believe this method more accurately reflects the utilization of corporate resources 
we also utilize this method internally to review results and allocate resources 
previously  we charged the significant portion of expenses associated with corporate activities to our brachytherapy segment 
we have restated our segment results for and to reflect this change in the method of allocating corporate expenses 
this change did not affect the reported amounts of segment revenue  nor did this change have any effect on our consolidated results of operations previously reported for and year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue following is a summary of revenue by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands revenue by segment year ended december  surgical products brachytherapy seed product sales licensing fees total brachytherapy seed intersegment eliminations consolidated surgical products segment revenue in our surgical products business increased in over  primarily as a result of our needletech acquisition 
on a pro forma basis  as if the needletech acquisition had occurred on january   revenue in our surgical products segment would have increased in over all three of our general product categories  including wound closure  introducers and guidewires  and specialty needles  recorded organic growth during our wound closure products performed particularly well  as we believe we provided exceptional value in that application 
open orders in our surgical products segment were million at december  compared to million at december  open orders are not guaranteed shipments  and they are subject to cancellation or delay 
a significant portion of the revenues in our surgical business is generated by sales to oems and a network of distributors 
ordering patterns of these customers vary and are difficult to predict 
accordingly  surgical products revenue is subject to fluctuation  especially on a quarter to quarter basis 
in addition  the volatility and disruptions in the us and global economies and credit markets  and other uncertainties due to the economic slowdown have had an effect on our surgical product revenue 
as general economic conditions worsened in the fourth quarter of  scheduled shipping dates for our open orders during the fourth quarter were farther out than we historically experienced 
we have not experienced a similar delay in requested shipping dates at the end of however  we expect that the difficult economic climate and macroeconomic uncertainties generally will continue to affect our surgical products business at least through  and perhaps make the fluctuations in our results even more volatile from period to period 
ii brachytherapy seed segment brachytherapy product sales decreased in from we believe that the industry wide decline in prostate brachytherapy procedure volume experienced in continued in some newer forms of treatment have increased their market share  especially those with medicare reimbursement levels that are higher than reimbursement levels for brachytherapy 
these newer forms of alternative treatments include intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt and robotic surgery 
we cannot predict when this industry wide decline in procedure volume will stabilize and expect continued softness in brachytherapy revenue into our revenues also continue to be affected by the performance of our main distributor 
sales to this distributor declined from to we also maintain our own internal brachytherapy sales force that sells theraseed and i seed directly to hospitals and physicians 
our direct sales declined in from to revenue from direct sales was of total brachytherapy segment product revenue in compared to in in addition to competition from treatment options that enjoy favorable reimbursement rates  we believe brachytherapy seed revenue is affected by disruptive pricing from other brachytherapy providers and uncertainties surrounding reimbursement as discussed below 
the average selling price of the theraseed device sold directly to hospitals and physicians during was comparable to the period 
we have non exclusive distribution agreements in place for the distribution of our theraseed device 
the primary distribution agreement is with c 
r 
bard bard  which is effective through december  the bard agreement 
sales under the bard agreement represented of brachytherapy product revenue in compared to in the terms of the bard agreement provide for automatic one year extensions of the term  unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the current term 
the current term expires on december  and will be automatically extended for one additional year unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend by december  in january we announced a supply and reseller agreement with core oncology the core agreement 
under the terms of the core agreement  we are the exclusive palladium seed supplier to core for the treatment of prostate cancer in the us and canada 
core can also sell theraseed for the treatment of other solid localized cancerous tumors 
the term of the agreement is through november   and is automatically extended for additional one year terms unless terminated by either party upon prior written notice 
we had no brachytherapy segment sales to core prior to sales to core under the core agreement are expected to be or more of total brachytherapy product revenue in we believe that medicare reimbursement policies have affected the brachytherapy market and will continue to affect the brachytherapy market 
prior to  medicare continued to reimburse for brachytherapy seeds under the charges adjusted to costs methodology  which is based on the actual invoiced cost of the seeds and which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology 
consistent with proposals that the centers for medicare medicaid services cms attempted unsuccessfully to implement in recent years  cms posted a final hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps on october  with fixed prospective payment rates for brachytherapy seeds 
this fixed opps  which we sometimes refer to as fixed reimbursement  went in effect on january  and fixes the per seed rate at which medicare reimburses hospitals for the purchase of seeds 
we expect to continue to support efforts to urge congress and cms to replace this fixed reimbursement rule by obtaining a new extension of the pass through reimbursement policies which existed prior to fixed reimbursement policies at cms can be expected to lead to pricing pressure from hospitals and other healthcare providers  and to have an adverse effect on our brachytherapy revenue 
the extent of the effect is impossible for us to predict  especially when fixed reimbursement policies are being introduced at a time that coincides with an industry wide decline in procedures being experienced due  at least in part  to favorable cms reimbursement rates enjoyed by alternative  less proven  technologies and uncertainties regarding healthcare reform generally 
these factors could have an adverse effect on brachytherapy revenue 
see medicare developments below for additional information regarding cms reimbursement policies for brachytherapy seeds 
license fees increased from  in to million in  and include fees from the licensing of our therasphere product  a medical device used for the treatment of liver cancer 
licensing fees also includes fees related to the licensing of certain intellectual property related to an expandable brachytherapy delivery system that we developed 
this agreement  which was executed in may  provides for a minimal non refundable initial license fee and non refundable continuing royalties based upon sales subject to certain minimums 
ii operating income loss and costs and expenses following is a summary of operating income loss by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands year ended december  surgical products operating income loss impairment of goodwill and tradenames surgical products excluding special items brachytherapy seed operating income impairment of goodwill and tradenames change in estimated value of asset held for sale brachytherapy seed excluding special items intersegment eliminations operating income loss consolidated excluding special items operating income excluding special items is a non gaap financial measure 
in addition to calculations measuring operating income loss as calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we utilize operating income excluding special items to make operational decisions  evaluate performance  prepare internal forecasts and allocate resources 
operating income excluding special items is a non gaap financial measure which  when compared with operating income loss calculated in accordance with gaap  allows us to more accurately determine whether a given increase or decrease in operations for a given segment is a result of an event that is non recurring in nature or is reflective of an on going performance issue 
we believe presentation of this non gaap financial measure provides supplemental information that is helpful to an understanding of the operating results of our businesses and period to period comparisons of performance 
however  we recognize that the use of non gaap measures has limitations  including the fact that they may not be directly comparable with similar non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
we compensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non gaap financial measure and providing a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
all non gaap financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable gaap disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
surgical products segment operating income excluding special items in our surgical products segment was million in compared to million in operating income in our surgical products segment included the results of needletech subsequent to our acquisition on july  accordingly  needletech was included in our consolidated results for all of but only for five months in our gross profit margin on products sales was in compared with in a number of factors affected the comparability between the and periods 
in  our gross profit and operating income was reduced by  of non cash charges related to the acquisition of needletech 
these non cash charges were related primarily to the fair value adjustments to needletech inventory at acquisition and did not recur in excluding these non cash acquisition related charges  our gross profit margin on product sales was in items affecting our gross profit margins in included  among other things  our product and sales channel mix changed subsequent to the needletech acquisition  with a larger proportion of sales being made to oem customers which generally carry lower gross profit margins relative to our other channels  continued investments in infrastructure to address expected future growth  and pricing pressures from our customers in  which we believe were at least in part caused by the general macroeconomic uncertainties 
part of our investments to support future growth in this segment includes the construction of a new specialty needle manufacturing facility 
we expect to move into this new facility during we expect to be completely moved out of our main existing leased facility by the end of our new facility should significantly increase the capacity of this operation 
in anticipation of the move  we may build inventory of our specialty needle products 
ii selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in our surgical products segment was of revenue in compared with in the decline in sg a as a percentage of revenue is due to the increasing scale of our surgical products segment  partially offset by the change in method of allocating our corporate costs 
we now allocate corporate costs based on the relative revenue of each of our two business segments 
because our surgical products segment comprised more of our consolidated revenue in the periods  primarily due to the inclusion of needletech in our consolidated results  corporate costs allocated to our surgical products segment increased by million in from amortization of purchased intangibles increased by million in from this is primarily due to the inclusion of amortization related to needletech purchased intangibles for a full year in we also recorded amortization expense related to our tradenames intangible assets totaling  in we did not record any tradename amortization in amortization of our tradenames intangible assets resulted from our reassessment of their useful lives during our impairment testing at december  operating income in our surgical products business in was also affected by increased investments in our research and development r d program 
r d expenses increased  in from our r d program was launched in the second half of this r d program is intended to focus on product extensions  next generation products  and new products that are complementary to our current product lines and that support our customers product lines 
our r d program is directed toward k products  and not on products that require lengthy and expensive clinical trials 
we have recently been reassessing the projects in our r d program in an effort to focus on opportunities with a more immediate impact 
we believe that opportunities to support programs for our customers may be more attractive for us than developing new products 
looking forward  we expect r d expense levels in to be similar to however  r d activities can be complex  and expense levels are also dependent upon the discovery of opportunities of which we are not currently aware 
accordingly  r d expenses are subject to significant variability from period to period 
during we began developing a new  corporate wide enterprise resource planning erp information technology system 
as our erp system was under development during  we capitalized certain internal costs associated with its development  totaling  in our surgical products segment 
these internal costs consisted primarily of employee payroll and related expenses 
upon completion of the erp system development at each location  these development costs will no longer be capitalized but will be charged as operating expenses 
we expect to complete the system development at most of our locations in looking forward to  we expect a number of items to affect our profitability including  among other things ordering patterns of our larger oem and distributor customers  continued investments in infrastructure and r d as we make investments to support anticipated future growth and to develop products to address growth opportunities  changes in product mix and sales channels  with sales through oem channels generally carrying a relatively lower gross profit margin and sales through distributor channels generally carrying a somewhat higher gross profit margin  continued pricing pressure from customers  the move to a new and larger specialty needle manufacturing facility  which is expected during  incurring moving and transition costs  as well as incurring higher maintenance and operating costs  the implementation of our new  corporate wide erp systems  and increasing scale of our surgical products business 
brachytherapy seed segment operating income excluding special items in our brachytherapy seed business was million in compared to million in manufacturing related expenses in our brachytherapy business tend to be relatively fixed in nature 
accordingly  even modest declines in revenue have a significant negative impact on operating income 
offsetting the decline in profitability from the decrease in revenue was a decrease in sg a expenses of  from a portion of this decline was from a reduction in the allocation of corporate costs in the we now allocate corporate costs based on the relative revenue of each of our two business segments 
because our brachytherapy revenue comprised less of our consolidated revenue in  mainly due to the inclusion of needletech in our consolidated results  corporate costs allocated to our brachytherapy business declined  in sg a in was also reduced from the elimination of maintenance and carrying costs related to our former oak ridge facility  which we sold in july  and a decrease in advertising related expenses 
operating income for also included a  benefit from the sale of our oak ridge facility 
no such benefit was realized in looking forward  operating income in our brachytherapy seed business is expected to continue to be highly dependent on sales levels due to the relatively fixed nature of our manufacturing costs 
ii our new erp system is also being developed for our brachytherapy seed business 
internal costs  including capitalized interest  totaling  were capitalized in this segment during as our erp system was under development 
these internal costs consisted primarily of employee payroll and related expenses 
upon completion of the development of our erp system  which is expected during  these development costs will no longer be capitalized but will be charged as operating expenses 
non operating income expense interest income decreased from million in to  in due to significantly lower yields on our investment portfolio 
during we had significant investments in auction rate securities 
these investments provided relatively higher returns than we experienced in  but they also turned out to be illiquid and riskier than expected 
we liquidated our auction rate securities in late and early at full value and without incurring any losses to principal 
however  due to the uncertainties and risks inherent in the current investment and credit markets  our investment portfolio in was much more conservatively invested than it was in all of our investments are currently held in banks  us treasury bills or highly rated money market accounts 
looking forward  we may invest our funds in higher yielding investments if those investments meet the conservative criteria established by our investment policies and the macroeconomic outlook becomes clearer 
funds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for our current and future expansion programs  for strategic opportunities for growth and diversification  and for installment payments on the term loan 
as funds continue to be used for these purposes  and as interest rates continue to change  we expect interest income to fluctuate accordingly 
for more information on the risks related to our investments  see critical accounting policies  liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  all of which are included in this report 
interest expense was  in compared to  in we maintained higher weighted average outstanding balances under our credit facility during this was offset by a lower effective interest rate 
our weighted average effective interest rate was at december  in addition  fair value adjustments related to our interest rate swaps are included in interest expense in such fair value adjustments are unrealized losses and totaled  in we manage our interest rate risk using interest rate swaps associated with outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement  as our interest rates are floating rates based on libor 
we do not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes  and we hold no other derivative financial instruments other than interest rate swaps 
we enter into interest rate swaps that are designed to hedge the interest rate risk but are not designated as hedging instruments  as defined under guidance issued by the fasb 
changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized as interest expense 
such changes in fair value are based on  among other things  discounted cash flows based upon current market expectations about future amounts  yield curves  and mid market pricing 
accordingly  the fair value of our interest rate swaps is subject to fluctuation and may have a significant effect on our results of operations in future periods 
additionally  the counterparty to our interest rate swaps is the lender under our credit agreement 
accordingly  we are exposed to counterparty credit risk from this financial institution 
we entered into interest rate swaps based on the relationship with this financial institution as our lender and on their credit rating and the rating of their parent company 
we continue to monitor our counterparty credit risk 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was in our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of 
these rates include federal and state income taxes 
our effective income tax rate in was significantly affected by our non cash impairment charges of goodwill and tradenames 
the majority of these impairment charges were not deductible for income tax purposes and  accordingly  the associated tax benefit was not significant 
future tax rates can be affected by  among other things  tax expense for items unrelated to actual taxable income such as the write off of deferred tax assets associated with share based compensation  changes in tax regulations  changes in statutory tax rates  changes in the tax jurisdictions in which we must file income tax returns  and many other items that affect the taxability and deductibility of our revenue and expenses and for which we cannot currently predict 
ii year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue surgical products segment revenue in our surgical products segment increased over as a result of the acquisition of needletech  organic growth  and expanded programs for existing customers 
on a pro forma basis  as if the needletech acquisition had occurred on january   revenue in our surgical products segment would have increased over a significant portion of the products in our surgical business is sold to oems and a network of distributors 
ordering patterns of these customers vary and are difficult to predict 
accordingly  surgical products revenue is subject to fluctuation  especially on a quarter to quarter basis 
in addition  the volatility and disruptions in the us and global economies and credit markets  and other uncertainties due to the economic slowdown in the us and around the world  had a negative effect on our surgical product revenue  especially as general economic conditions worsened in the fourth quarter of scheduled shipping dates for orders were farther out than we have typically experienced 
we believe the lengthening lead times were  at least in part  our customers response to hospitals efforts to reduce inventories and conserve cash 
we believe this affected all companies in the supply chain  including ours 
brachytherapy seed segment brachytherapy product sales decreased in compared to the decrease in product sales included a decline in sales to our main distributor of 
we believe there was an industry wide decline in prostate brachytherapy procedure volume in some newer forms of treatment increased their market share  especially those with medicare reimbursement levels that are higher than reimbursement levels for brachytherapy 
these newer forms of alternative treatments include imrt and robotic surgery 
our revenues also continued to be affected by the disappointing performance of our main distributor 
we also maintained our own internal brachytherapy sales force that sells theraseed and i seed directly to hospitals and physicians 
revenue from direct sales was of total brachytherapy segment revenue in and in in addition to treatment options that enjoy favorable reimbursement rates  we believe that our brachytherapy seed revenue was also affected by disruptive pricing from other brachytherapy providers and uncertainties surrounding reimbursement 
the average selling price of the theraseed device sold directly to hospitals and physicians was down slightly in compared to we have non exclusive distribution agreements in place for the distribution of the theraseed device 
during the primary distribution agreement was with bard 
sales to bard under the bard agreement represented of brachytherapy product revenue in compared with in operating income loss and costs and expenses surgical products segment operating income in the surgical products segment included the results of needletech subsequent to acquisition on july  surgical products operating income excluding special items was million in compared to million in gross margins in our surgical products segment were in compared to in our gross margins in were negatively affected by  of non cash acquisition related charges related to the needletech acquisition 
these non cash charges were related primarily to the fair value adjustments to needletech inventory at acquisition 
gross margins are also dependent on sales channel and product mix 
sg a expenses in our surgical products business were and of revenue in and  respectively 
in  sg a as a percentage of revenue declined due to the increasing scale of our surgical products segment offset somewhat by higher recruiting  relocation  and information technology infrastructure costs as compared to sg a also increased in because of the change in method of allocating our corporate costs 
we allocate corporate costs based on the relative revenue of each of our two business segments 
because our surgical products segment comprised more of our consolidated revenue in the periods  primarily due to the inclusion of needletech in our consolidated results  corporate costs allocated to our surgical products segment increased by million in from we also implemented a new r d program in our surgical products business in the fourth quarter of this r d program is intended to focus on product extensions  next generation products and new products that are complementary to our current product lines 
r d expenses in our surgical products segment were million in compared to  in ii brachytherapy seed segment operating income excluding special items in the brachytherapy seed segment was million in compared to million in in december we increased the estimated service lives of our cyclotron equipment from years to years 
this change reduced manufacturing related depreciation expense by approximately million in from what would have otherwise been reported 
despite the lower depreciation expense  our operating income declined in primarily as a result of lower revenue 
manufacturing related expenses in our brachytherapy business tend to be relatively fixed in nature 
accordingly  even modest declines in revenue have a significant negative impact on operating income 
partially offsetting the lower revenue was a million decrease in sg a expenses compared to primarily as a result of lower compensation related expenses and the elimination of maintenance expenses and carrying costs related to our oak ridge facility  which we sold in july sg a also declined because of the change in method of allocating our corporate costs 
we allocate corporate costs based on the relative revenue of each of our two business segments 
because our brachytherapy revenue comprised less of our consolidated revenue in  mainly due to the inclusion of needletech in our consolidated results  corporate costs allocated to our brachytherapy business declined  in from r d expenses in the brachytherapy seed segment also declined in sale of asset held for sale in we completed the sale of our oak ridge facility in july this facility was previously classified as a long term asset held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet 
as part of this transaction  the facility was sold and the underlying land sublease was terminated 
the significant portion of the present value of the future payments due under that sublease was previously classified as a long term contract termination liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
the  gain realized from the completion of the sale in july  including the termination of the sublease  was recognized as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for sale in during we recorded a  write down of the carrying value of the oak ridge facility based on the general deterioration of the commercial real estate markets and in the overall economy at the time 
impairment of goodwill and tradenames in goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not required 
if book value exceeds fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the book value amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
when we have goodwill or other intangible assets not subject to amortization recorded in our consolidated balance sheet  we perform impairment testing at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the same as  or one level below  an operating segment 
our annual impairment testing is typically performed during the fourth quarter of each year  which coincides with the timing of our annual budgeting and forecasting process 
we also make judgments about goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of such asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet may exist 
the timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our consolidated statements of operations in future reporting periods that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization  we typically prepare discounted cash flow analyses income approach and comparable company market multiples analyses market approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
for the income approach  we project future cash flows for each reporting unit 
this approach requires significant judgments including the projected net cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount the cash flows and terminal value assumptions 
we derive the assumptions related to cash flows primarily from our internal budgets and forecasts 
these budgets and forecasts include information related to our current and future products  revenues  capacity  operating costs  and other information 
all such information is derived in the context of our long term operational strategies 
the wacc and terminal value assumptions are based on the capital structure  cost of capital  inherent business risk profiles  and industry outlooks for each of our reporting units  and for our company on a consolidated basis 
ii for the market approach  we identify reasonably similar public companies for each of our reporting units  analyze the financial and operating performance of these similar companies relative to our financial and operating performance  calculate market multiples primarily based on the ratio of business enterprise value bev to revenue and bev to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  adjust such multiples for differences between the similar companies and our reporting units  and apply the resulting multiples to the fundamentals of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
to assess the reasonableness of our valuations under each method  we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
the most recent goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment was performed in the fourth quarter of we determined that all of our goodwill was impaired and that a portion of our tradenames intangible asset was impaired 
these impairment charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of a summary of impairment charges by segment follows amounts in thousands goodwill tradenames total surgical products segment brachytherapy seed segment total impairment charges in our market capitalization declined significantly in the fourth quarter of  along with the significant declines in the overall market value of all of the major stock markets in the united states and around the world 
we considered our market capitalization when we developed the appropriate discount rates and comparable company market multiples for purposes of estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the significant decline in our market capitalization resulted in discount rates that were considerably higher  and comparable company market multiples that were considerably lower  than the discount rates and comparable company market multiples we previously considered appropriate 
the most significant assumption leading to our impairment charges in the fourth quarter of was the various discount rates for our reporting units  all of which exceeded at that point in time 
we attempted to identify the underlying reasons for this circumstance 
we considered many factors  including the conditions of the companies in our sectors  unusual short selling or other unusual activity in the trading of our common stock  and whether the overall general economic outlook and stock market declines could be considered as temporary 
we were unable to identify any of these factors as directly affecting the decline in our market capitalization 
the long term expectations for our reporting units did not materially change during the period 
we concluded that the significant increase in our discount rates and decrease in our comparable company market multiples was a result of the increased risk associated with the distressed equity and credit markets generally  especially as these factors relate to a small company such as ours 
in addition  we believe the increasing prevalence of shareholders and investors trading securities outside of traditional stock exchanges contributes to share price volatility  especially over the short term 
finally  the scarcity of capital  especially for smaller companies such as ours  affects the risks associated with investments in its common stock and its share price 
in connection with our goodwill and tradenames impairment testing in the fourth quarter of  we also assessed the estimated useful lives of our tradenames 
at december   we determined that current facts and circumstances no longer supported an indefinite life for our tradenames intangible asset 
in considering all of the facts and circumstances at that time  including the increased risk associated with our businesses as perceived by investors  the distressed general equity and credit markets  especially as these factors relate to smaller companies such as ours  and the significant economic uncertainties caused by the worsening overall economic conditions  we concluded that an indefinite life for our tradenames intangible assets was no longer supportable 
we also considered changes to our terminal value assumptions in our estimate of fair value for each reporting unit  which affected assumptions beyond year in our cash flow forecasts 
accordingly  we estimated that the remaining useful life of the recorded amount of our tradenames was years  and we began to amortize tradenames over years beginning in prior to december   we estimated that our tradenames intangible assets had indeterminate lives and  accordingly  were not subject to amortization 
we also review long lived assets  including our intangible assets subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we group these assets at the lowest level that we could reasonably estimate the identifiable cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long lived assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if the carrying amounts exceed the future undiscounted cash flows  then the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
as a result of the impairment indicators related to goodwill and tradenames  we tested our long lived assets for impairment at december   and determined that there was no impairment 
ii non operating income expense interest income was million in compared with million in the amount included  of one time interest income related to million of refunded federal income taxes 
interest income also decreased in as a result of cash used for the needletech acquisition and lower yields due to a more conservative investment mix and declining market interest rates 
interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase was due to an additional million of borrowings under our credit facility for the needletech acquisition 
other non operating income in totaled  this amount consisted of gains from the sale of scrap metal from one of our operating facilities of  offsetting this gain in was  in losses in our marketable securities  which included a  impairment charge related to a decline in market value of one of our investments that we considered to be a permanent decline 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of 
in our effective income tax rate was 
our effective income tax rate in was significantly affected by our non cash impairment charges of goodwill and tradenames 
the majority of these impairment charges were not deductible for income tax purposes and  accordingly  the associated tax benefit was not significant 
during  the irs completed an examination of our and federal income tax returns with no significant adjustments 
upon settlement of the audit  during we received a refund of federal income tax previously paid of million 
this refund resulted from the carryback of tax losses that were reported in our federal income tax return 
we also received  of interest income related to this refund  which was recognized upon settlement of the irs examination in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for our judgment in their application 
the accounting policies described below are those which we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and are areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
marketable securities 
we review our investments in marketable securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
due to the severe volatility and disruptions related to the us and global investment and credit markets  we are exposed to the risk of changes in fair value of our marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that we do not currently anticipate 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward 
you can find more information related to the valuation of our marketable securities in note e in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  liquidity and capital resources in management s discussion and analysis  and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  all of which are included in this report 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
our estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
the significant portion of equipment is comprised of cyclotrons  which are utilized in the brachytherapy business 
as of december   we owned and operated eight cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in in december we changed the estimated service lives of certain depreciable assets  mainly the cyclotron equipment 
the estimated service life of the cyclotron equipment was increased from years to years  and was based on  among other things  an assessment of the equipment s operating and maintenance history and expected future performance 
we accounted for this change as a change in estimate 
accordingly  this change was accounted for in the period of the change and will be accounted for in future periods 
this change reduced depreciation expense by approximately  and million in and  respectively  compared to what it would have been using the former estimated useful life 
the effect of this change was not significant in ii we will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness 
if we determine that the useful life of property or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful lives of the identified assets 
we assess the impairment of our depreciable assets including property  equipment  and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in the event the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the estimation of fair value  whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale  also involves judgment 
it is possible that our estimates of fair value may change and impact our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the impairment indicators related to goodwill in the fourth quarter of  we performed an assessment of our long lived assets and determined that there was no impairment 
see impairment of goodwill and tradenames in above under results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not required 
if book value exceeds fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
when we have goodwill or other intangible assets not subject to amortization recorded in our consolidated balance sheet  we perform impairment testing at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the same as  or one level below  an operating segment 
our annual impairment testing is typically performed during the fourth quarter of each year  which coincides with the timing of our annual budgeting and forecasting process 
we also make judgments about goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of such asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet may exist 
the timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our consolidated statements of operations in future reporting periods that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization  we typically prepare discounted cash flow analyses income approach and comparable company market multiples analyses market approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
for the income approach  we project future cash flows for each reporting unit 
this approach requires significant judgments including the projected net cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount the cash flows and terminal value assumptions 
we derive the assumptions related to cash flows primarily from our internal budgets and forecasts 
these budgets and forecasts include information related to our current and future products  revenues  capacity  operating costs  and other information 
all such information is derived in the context of our long term operational strategies 
the wacc and terminal value assumptions are based on the capital structure  cost of capital  inherent business risk profiles  and industry outlooks for each of our reporting units  and for our company on a consolidated basis 
for the market approach  we identify reasonably similar public companies for each of our reporting units  analyze the financial and operating performance of these similar companies relative to our financial and operating performance  calculate market multiples primarily based on the ratio of business enterprise value bev to revenue and bev to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  adjust such multiples for differences between the similar companies and our reporting units  and apply the resulting multiples to the fundamentals of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
to assess the reasonableness of our valuations under each method  we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
the most recent goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment was performed in the fourth quarter of we determined that all of our goodwill was impaired and that a portion of our tradenames intangible asset was impaired 
see impairment of goodwill and tradenames in above 
ii other intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives using a method that is expected to reflect the pattern of its economic benefit 
when a pattern of economic benefit cannot be determined  or if the straight line method results in greater amortization  then the straight line method is used 
to date  all finite lived intangible assets have been amortized using the straight line method 
we also review finite lived intangible assets for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
we make estimates and use our judgments in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of our accounts receivable balances may become uncollectible or subject to return 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance 
specifically  we analyze accounts receivable in relation to customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment history  and changes in sales returns history in establishing this allowance 
it is possible that these or other underlying factors could change and impact our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for obsolete inventory 
we review inventory periodically and record an estimated allowance for inventory that has become obsolete  that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  or that is in excess of expected requirements 
specifically  we analyze inventory in relation to sales history  inventory turnover and days supply on hand  competing products  current economic trends  changes in our customers ordering histories  and historical write offs 
our estimate is subjective and dependent on our estimates of future demand for a particular product 
if our estimate of future demand exceeds actual demand  we may have to increase the allowance for obsolete inventory for that product and record a charge to cost of product sales 
asset retirement obligations 
we estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  discount that cost to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future decommissioning costs  inflation  cost of capital  and market risk premiums 
the nature of these estimates requires us to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of guidance issued by fasb 
under this method  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we utilize the black scholes model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment  which makes them critical accounting estimates 
our expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of our stock 
with respect to the weighted average option life assumption  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units collectively  the stock units are based on the fair value of the underlying common stock and is recognized over the requisite service period 
for stock units containing performance conditions  the grant date fair value is adjusted each period for the number of shares ultimately expected to be issued 
for stock units subject to discretionary performance conditions  the grant date has not been established and accordingly  the fair value of the award is updated each period for changes in the fair value of the underlying common stock 
to the extent that the underlying fair value of our common stock varies significantly  and or the number of shares issuable is determined  we may record additional compensation expense or adjust previously recognized compensation expense 
accounting for income taxes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws and our interpretation of current tax laws 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our tax provision and our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  including the valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could differ materially from our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and recognize the tax benefit only as reassessment demonstrates that they are realizable 
at such time  if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance is adjusted 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for the valuation allowance each reporting period 
in the future if  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding our ability to generate adequate future taxable income  it becomes more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the valuation allowance may be required to be increased 
we review all of our tax positions 
the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that we will be able to sustain a position taken on an income tax return 
we have concluded that there were no significant uncertain tax positions as of december  and our policy is to recognize accrued interest expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
ii contingencies 
from time to time we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including  for example  disputes  disputes on agreements  employment disputes and other commercial disputes  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for damages and or costs related to claims  settlements and judgments where we have assessed that a loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred 
commitments and other contractual obligations contractual obligations we lease equipment and production  warehouse  office and other space under non cancelable leases that expire at various dates through may we also have million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
approximate minimum payments of these obligations are as follows amounts in thousands total less than year years years more than years obligation operating lease obligations rental space and equipment production  office and warehouse space related parties total operating lease obligations borrowings under credit agreement interest payable on short term borrowings total short term borrowings contractual obligations for new building construction other obligations total the surgical products business leases approximately  square feet of production  warehouse  and office space from two related entities 
see item properties above and note k to our consolidated financial statements 
includes million term loan payable at million annually through june  and million outstanding under million revolving credit facility  which matures october interest on outstanding borrowings under credit facility at the december  based on effective interest rates at december  letter of credit we have a letter of credit outstanding under the credit facility as of december  totaling  this letter of credit is related to asset retirement liabilities of long lived assets 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  operational investments to support growth such as research and development programs  and acquisitions of businesses and technologies 
we have cash and cash equivalents of million at december  at december  we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
marketable securities consisted primarily of high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations  in accordance with our investment policies 
see cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities below for more information 
ii we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of needletech products  inc needletech on july  for million in cash including transaction costs 
we retained the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held by needletech  which had an estimated fair value of approximately million at the acquisition date 
we financed million of the purchase price with borrowings on our existing million credit facility and paid the remainder from our current cash and investment balances 
working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in working capital is primarily due to the classification of million of borrowings under our credit facility as a short term liability at december   thus reducing working capital 
during we refinanced our credit facility  and million of our borrowings are classified as long term at december  and  accordingly  were not a part of working capital 
in may  we executed an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with a financial institution 
the credit agreement provides for up to million of borrowings under a revolving credit facility the revolver and a million term loan the term loan 
the revolver matures on october  with interest payable at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
maximum borrowings under the revolver can be increased to million with the prior approval of the financial institution under an accordion feature 
the revolver also provides for a million sub limit for trade and stand by letters of credit 
letters of credit totaling  representing decommission funding required by the georgia department of natural resources  were outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  the term loan is payable in thirty six equal monthly installments of principal plus interest at libor plus  commencing july  the credit agreement is unsecured  but provides for a lien to be established on substantially all of our assets upon certain events of default 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties  as well as affirmative  reporting and negative covenants customary for financings of this type 
among other things  the credit agreement restricts the incurrence of certain additional debt and certain capital expenditures  and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum liabilities to tangible net worth ratio  and the maintenance of minimum liquid assets of million  as all such ratios and terms are defined in the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  this credit agreement amended and restated our prior credit agreement  which was scheduled to mature on october  and provided for a million revolving loan and letter of credit commitment 
cash provided by operations was million in  compared to million in cash provided by operations consists of net earnings  plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  and changes in balance sheet items such as accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and payables 
the decline in was primarily a result of the decline in net income in  excluding the effects of our non cash impairment charges in cash from operations in also benefited from a million tax refund received during the year as a result of the use of an income tax loss generated in the use of this loss also allowed us to reduce income tax payable in we have no significant remaining tax loss carryforwards and expect to pay income taxes at normal rates going forward 
capital expenditures totaled million in and million in the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the development of enterprise resource planning erp software for internal use  in connection with our corporate wide upgrades to our information technology systems 
in  we also purchased a facility for our specialty needle operations and began renovating and adding onto that facility 
capital expenditures are expected to increase in as we complete work on our new manufacturing facility and continue development of our new erp systems 
these programs  along with our capital expenditures in the normal course  could increase our capital expenditure level to as much as million in in we used million in cash for financing activities  primarily for scheduled principal payments under our credit facility 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting primarily of the million proceeds from our credit facility  which was used in our needletech acquisition  offset by  for the payment of certain expenses for which we were indemnified and reimbursed by receipt of  shares of our common stock 
r d expenses were million in we expect to continue to use cash in to support growth in the surgical products segment  especially for the r d program implemented in late looking forward  we expect r d expense levels in to be similar to however  r d activities can be complex  and expense levels are also dependent upon the discovery of opportunities of which we are not currently aware 
accordingly  r d expenses are subject to significant variability form period to period 
we may also continue to use cash for increased marketing and theraseed support activities  and in the pursuit of additional diversification efforts such as product development and the purchase of technologies  products or companies 
we believe that current cash  cash equivalents  and investment balances and cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our current short term anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
however  continued disruption and instability in the us and global financial markets and worldwide economies may hinder our ability to take advantage of opportunities for long term growth in our businesses 
in the event additional financing becomes necessary  we may choose to raise those funds through other means of financing as appropriate 
ii cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we did not hold any marketable securities at december  looking forward  we may invest our funds in marketable securities and higher yielding investments than those we held at december   if those investments meet the conservative criteria established by our investment policies and the macroeconomic outlook becomes clearer 
our cash equivalents include million of bank deposits  money market funds  and us treasury securities 
we review our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
looking forward  we may invest our funds in higher yielding investments if those investments meet the conservative criteria established by our investment policies and the macroeconomic outlook becomes clearer 
funds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for our current and future expansion programs  for strategic opportunities for growth and diversification  and for installment payments on the term loan 
as funds continue to be used for these purposes  and as interest rates continue to change  we expect interest income to fluctuate accordingly 
due to the disruptions  volatility and uncertainties related to the us and global investment and credit markets we are exposed to the risk of further changes in fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that are not currently anticipated 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward 
medicare developments background the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  which went into effect on january   contained brachytherapy provisions requiring medicare to reimburse hospital outpatient departments for each brachytherapy seed source furnished between january  to december  based on the hospital s costs for each patient calculated from the hospital s charges adjusted by the hospital s specific cost to charge ratio 
the act also directed the us government accountability office gao to conduct a study examining future payment policies for brachytherapy seeds 
the gao published its report on july   concluding that the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  the regulatory body that sets medicare reimbursement policies  could establish separate prospective payment rates effective in for palladium brachytherapy seeds sources such as theraseed and iodine seeds sources using medicare s hospital outpatient data 
although subsequently superseded by congress  cms posted a final rule on november  with fixed prospective payment rates for brachytherapy seeds for medicare s hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps that would have applied to calendar year the use of prospective payment rates would have fixed the per seed rate at which medicare would have reimbursed hospitals in we believed that cms approach to determining the fixed prospective reimbursement rate for brachytherapy seeds was fundamentally flawed 
for example  cms did not stratify cost data on differing seed configurations  such as loose versus stranded seeds 
accordingly  we continued to work with policy makers in an effort to rectify the shortcomings we believed to be contained in the new cms rule 
in december  congress enacted the tax relief and health care act of the act  which extended and refined the medicare safeguards initially enacted by congress in for brachytherapy seeds administered in the hospital outpatient setting 
the act s provisions on brachytherapy superseded the final rule published by cms on november  by extending the existing charges adjusted to cost reimbursement policies which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology for brachytherapy seeds through the end of  ensuring that the medicare program would not implement potentially restrictive caps on reimbursement during that period 
in addition  the legislation recognized that prostate cancer patients must have meaningful access to stranded brachytherapy seeds  which increasingly are used in clinical practice to further enhance the safety and efficacy of treatment 
the act also established a permanent requirement for medicare to use separate codes for the reimbursement of stranded brachytherapy devices 
stranded seeds are becoming a larger portion of our brachytherapy business 
effective july  cms issued new reimbursement codes for brachytherapy sources 
the codes are isotope specific and recognize the distinction between non stranded versus stranded seeds  as mandated by the act 
in early november  cms again posted a final opps rule for calendar year with fixed prospective reimbursement rates for all brachytherapy source codes  including the new codes established in july in december  congress passed the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of the act  which once again superseded another cms final opps rule by extending the existing pass through reimbursement policies for brachytherapy seeds through june  fixed reimbursement rates would have become effective on january  without the enactment of the act 
as a result of the act  fixed reimbursement rates for seeds were delayed until july  ii on july   the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of the act was enacted into law 
the act extends medicare s longstanding pass through reimbursement policies for brachytherapy seeds administered in the hospital outpatient setting through december   ensuring that the medicare program does not implement potentially restrictive caps on reimbursement during this period 
the act was retroactive to july  current status prior to  medicare continued to reimburse for brachytherapy seeds under the charges adjusted to costs methodology  which is based on the actual invoiced cost of the seeds and which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology 
consistent with proposals that cms attempted unsuccessfully to implement in recent years  cms posted a final hospital opps on october  with fixed prospective payment rates for brachytherapy seeds 
this fixed opps  which we sometimes refer to as fixed reimbursement  went in effect on january  and fixes the per seed rate at which medicare reimburses hospitals for the purchase of seeds 
we continue to support efforts that urge congress and cms to replace this fixed reimbursement rule by obtaining a new extension of the pass through reimbursement policies which existed prior to fixed reimbursement policies at cms can be expected to lead to pricing pressure from hospitals and other healthcare providers  and to have an adverse effect on our brachytherapy revenue 
the extent of the effect is impossible for us to predict  especially when fixed reimbursement policies are being introduced at a time that coincides with an industry wide decline in procedures being experienced due  at least in part  to favorable cms reimbursement rates enjoyed by alternative  less proven  technologies and uncertainties regarding healthcare reform generally 
these factors could have an adverse effect on brachytherapy revenue 
forward looking and cautionary statements this document contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including  without limitation  statements regarding sales  marketing and distribution efforts  ordering patterns of customers  short term volatility of our results  our sales channels including our oem  distributor and direct sales channels organization and their growth and effectiveness  third party reimbursement  cms policy  sales mix  effectiveness and continuation of non exclusive distribution agreements  expected effect of our new theraseed distribution agreement with core oncology  pricing for the theraseed and i seed devices  anticipated growth in the surgical products business segment  plans to increase our specialty needle manufacturing capacity  future cost of sales and gross margins  r d efforts and expenses including our centralized  corporate wide r d initiative  investment in additional personnel  infrastructure and capital assets  implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system  future sg a expenses  other income  potential new products and opportunities  potential effects of environmental  nuclear  regulatory and occupational health and safety laws and regulations  future results in general  plans and strategies for continuing diversification  valuation of marketable securities and cash equivalents we may hold  and the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources

ii quarterly results the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data for each of the last eight quarters 
this unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited information presented elsewhere in this form k  reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal  recurring adjustments which are  in our opinion  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods covered and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have exposure to market risk as a result of changing interest rates on a portion of our borrowings under our credit agreement 
we have outstanding borrowings of million under our credit agreement in the form of a term loan that is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately  through july interest is payable at libor plus 
we have entered into a floating to fixed rate swap agreement that expires in july with respect to the outstanding amount of the term loan at a fixed interest rate of 
we also have outstanding borrowings of million under the revolver component of our credit agreement 
the revolver matures in october interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolver is payable at libor plus 
we entered into a separate floating to fixed rate swap that expires in july with respect to million of the principal amount outstanding under the revolver at a fixed interest rate of 
accordingly  we are exposed to changes in interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our revolver in excess of million 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate applicable to the borrowings in excess of million would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of  per year before income taxes  assuming the same level of borrowings 
ii we review our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
due to the uncertainties related to the us and global investment and credit markets we are exposed to the risk of further changes in fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that are not currently anticipated 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward
