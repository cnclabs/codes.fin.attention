item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
during fiscal  we renegotiated the terms of our line of credit due to significant restructuring charges incurred in europe that would have put us in violation of debt covenant ratios 
failure to comply with the updated terms of our line of credit agreement could result in a default allowing our lenders to declare all borrowings under the line of credit to be immediately due and payable 
this would require us to obtain additional financing or renegotiate the terms of our line of credit agreement again 
the terms under which we could obtain new or revised financing would likely be less favorable and require higher interest rates  significant fees and tighter restrictions and covenants 
economic  political and other risks associated with international operations foreign operations represent a significant portion of our business 
we expect revenue from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales 
as noted in properties item  we own or lease facilities in several foreign countries throughout the world 
since we manufacture and sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including foreign currency exchange risks  difficulty in staffing and managing global operations  imposition of foreign exchange controls  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets such as china  seizure of our property or assets by a foreign government  tariffs  quotas  other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  restrictions on our ability to own or operate or repatriate profits from our subsidiaries  make investments or acquire new businesses in foreign jurisdictions  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  differing labor regulations  requirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  civil unrest or war in any of the countries in which we operate  unexpected transportation delays or interruptions  difficulty in enforcement of contractual obligations governed by non us law and complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic or political conditions globally and in any of the countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movements  new currency or exchange controls or other restrictions being imposed on our operations 
because our combined financial results are reported in us dollars  translation of sales or earnings generated in other currencies into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 
in addition  our debt service requirements are primarily in us dollars  even though a portion of our cash flow is generated in foreign currencies 
significant changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which our earnings are generated make it more difficult to perform period to period comparisons of our reported results of operations 
for purposes of accounting  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations  where the local currency is the functional currency  are translated using period end exchange rates  and the revenues  expenses and cash flows of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity 
given the volatility of exchange rates  we cannot be assured we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and or translation risks 
we have purchased and may continue to purchase foreign currency hedging instruments protecting or offsetting positions in certain currencies to reduce the risk of adverse currency fluctuations 
we only purchase these instruments to cover actual currency exposures 
we have in the past experienced and expect to experience at times in the future an impact on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
original equipment manufacturers sourcing practices we sell approximately of our products directly to oems  several of which are global manufacturers 
the following actions taken by these oems could significantly affect our business adjusting their inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations 
shifting from local or regional sourcing of products to lower cost global sourcing 
altering the distribution channels of certain products by acquiring all or part of their dealer network or by exerting influence over their sale of replacement parts and attachments through their distribution channels 
manufacturing their own attachments 
competition our products do not depend upon proprietary technology to any significant degree  and therefore can be subject to intense competition 
competitive characteristics of our products include overall performance  ease of use  quality  safety  customer service and support  manufacturing lead times  global reach  brand reputation  breadth of product line and price 
our customers increasingly demand more technologically advanced and integrated products in certain cases and we must continue to develop our expertise and technical capabilities in order to manufacture and market these products successfully 
to retain our competitive position  we will need to invest continuously in research and development and improve our manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities our operations and properties are subject to stringent us and foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations govern the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties as well as air emissions  water discharges  waste management and disposal and workplace health and safety 
we can be held responsible under these laws and regulations whether or not the original actions were legal and whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
we could be responsible for payment of the full amount of any liability  whether or not any other responsible party also is liable 
these laws and regulations affect a significant percentage of our operations  are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations 
further  they may require substantial clean up costs for our properties  many of which are sites of long standing manufacturing operations  and the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and or 
table of contents decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions as these requirements change 
we routinely deal with natural gas  oil and other petroleum products 
as a result of our operations  we generate  manage and dispose of or recycle hazardous wastes and substances such as solvents  thinner  waste paint  waste oil  wash down wastes and sandblast material 
hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from properties owned  leased or operated by us or on  under or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties may be subject to investigatory  clean up and monitoring requirements under us and foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
in prior years  we entered into settlement agreements with various environmental insurance providers with respect to litigation of claims under insurance policies issued by the providers to recover expenses incurred in connection with environmental and related proceedings 
as a part of these settlement agreements  we released all of our rights to any future recovery under these policies 
loss of senior management the success of our business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
several members of our senior management team have been with us for over years  including our president and chief operating officer  who have each been with us for over years 
we may lose the services of key management personnel or fail to attract and develop additional personnel 
reliance on customers approximately of our products are sold to the end user customer through oeds 
therefore  a significant portion of our sales is dependent on the quality and effectiveness of these dealers  who are not subject to our control 
in addition  under current economic conditions customers may experience difficulty in obtaining credit to fund purchases of our products 
underfunded benefit plans our obligations under our postretirement benefit plan and certain foreign subsidiaries defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded 
at some time in the future we may have to make significant cash payments to fund these plans  which would reduce the cash available for our business 
as of january  our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation under our postretirement benefit plan  which is not funded  was million 
as of january   our projected benefit obligations under our defined benefit pension plans exceed the fair value of assets by million 
the underfunding in our defined benefit pension plans are impacted by fluctuations in the discount rate and financial markets that cause the valuation of assets to change 
also  the trustees of the uk defined benefit plan could decide to wind up the plan  which would cause us to be required to immediately fund the plan through a buyout of the obligation in full 
we expect any required cash payments to our plans that are not fully funded will be made from future cash flows from operations 
if our cash contributions are insufficient to adequately fund the plans to cover our future obligations  the performance of the pension plan assets do not meet our expectations or assumptions are modified  our contributions could be materially higher than we expect 
this would reduce the cash available for our business 
changes in us or foreign laws governing these plans could require us to make additional contributions and changes to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could require the recording of additional costs related to these plans 
impact of acquisitions we have historically expanded our business through acquisitions and expect we will do so in the future if appropriate opportunities arise 
if we are not successful in integrating acquisitions  we may not realize the 
table of contents operating results we anticipated at the time of acquisition 
in addition  industry downturns in the markets the acquired companies serve and general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial results 
future acquisitions may require us to incur additional debt and contingent liabilities  which may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks  including doing business in industries outside the lift truck material handling business  difficulties in matching the business culture of the acquired business with our culture  difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees  difficulties in retaining customers and integrating customer bases  diversion of management s attention from existing operations due to the integration of acquired businesses  difficulties in integrating operations and systems  and assumption of unexpected liabilities 
due to the decreased availability of  and the related high cost in accessing  liquidity and credit in this current volatile credit and capital market  we may  in a bid to conserve cash for operations  undertake acquisitions that would be financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities  or other arrangements 
such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures 
we cannot guarantee any such acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required 
if we were to undertake an acquisition by issuing equity securities  the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares
