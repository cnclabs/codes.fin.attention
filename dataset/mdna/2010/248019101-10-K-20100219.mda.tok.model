item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview our business is organized into three segments small business services  financial services and direct checks 
our small business services segment generated of our consolidated revenue for this segment has sold personalized printed products  which include business checks  printed forms  promotional products  marketing materials and related services  as well as retail packaging supplies and a suite of business services  including web design and hosting  fraud protection  payroll  logo design  search engine marketing and business networking  to approximately million small businesses in the last months 
these products and services are sold through direct response marketing  referrals from financial institutions and telecommunications companies  independent distributors and dealers  the internet and sales representatives 
our financial services segment generated of our consolidated revenue for this segment sells personal and business checks  check related products and services  customer loyalty and retention programs  fraud monitoring and protection services  and stored value gift cards to approximately  financial institution clients nationwide  including banks  credit unions and financial services companies  primarily through a direct sales force 
our direct checks segment generated of our consolidated revenue for this segment is the nation s leading direct to consumer check supplier  selling under the checks unlimited  designer checks and checks 
com brand names 
through these brands  we sell personal and business checks and related products and services directly to consumers using direct response marketing and the internet 
we operate primarily in the united states 
small business services also has operations in canada and europe 
our business continued to be negatively impacted during by the severe downturn in the economy and by turmoil in the financial services industry 
demand fell for many of our small business services products as small business owners reduced their discretionary spending 
additionally  interruptions and consumer uncertainty related to financial institution consolidations and failures have led to reduced check orders from several of our financial institution clients 
at the same time  we accelerated many of our cost reduction actions  and we identified additional opportunities to improve our cost structure 
we believe we have taken appropriate steps to position ourselves for sustainable growth as the economy recovers  including investing in acquisitions that offer higher growth business services  enhancing our internet capabilities  improving customer segmentation and adding new small business customers 
we are focused on capitalizing on transformational opportunities available to us in this difficult environment and believe that we will be positioned to consistently deliver strong margins once the economy recovers 
our net income for  as compared to  benefited from the following various initiatives to reduce our cost structure  primarily within sales and marketing  manufacturing and information technology  a decrease of million in restructuring and related costs in  as compared to  pre tax gains of million from the retirement of long term notes  price increases implemented by all three segments  and increased sales of fraud protection services by small business services and direct checks 
these benefits were more than offset by the following lower volume in small business services due primarily to changes in our customers buying patterns  we believe  as a result of the economic recession  reduced volume for our personal check businesses due to the continuing decline in check usage  turmoil in the financial services industry  including a higher number of bank failures  and continued economic softness  an increase of approximately million in performance based compensation expense because our results of operations were within the range of performance metrics established for the year  asset impairment charges of million within small business services related to goodwill and an indefinite lived trade name  as compared to asset impairment charges of million in related to small business services trade names  increases in material prices and delivery rates  and transaction costs of million related to acquisitions completed in  primarily costs to migrate customers of the acquired companies onto our information technology platform

these key enablers include continuing to improve our e commerce capabilities  implementing an integrated platform for our various brands  improving our customer analytics  focusing on key customer segments and improving our merchandising

we have also identified opportunities to expand sales to our existing customers and to acquire new customers 
our improved e commerce platform  www

financial services our strategies within financial services are as follows optimize core check revenue streams and acquire new clients  provide services and products that differentiate us from the competition by helping financial institutions grow core deposits  and continue to optimize our cost and expense structure 
we will continue our focus on acquiring new clients during we are also leveraging our loyalty  retention and fraud monitoring and protection offers  as well as our deluxe business advantage program 
the deluxe business advantage program is designed to maximize financial institution business check programs by offering the products and services of our small business services segment to small businesses through a number of service level options 
the revenue from the products and services sold through this program is reflected in our small business services segment 

table of contents in our efforts to expand beyond check related products  we have introduced several services and products that focus on customer loyalty and retention  as well as fraud monitoring and protection 
following are some examples deluxe id theftblock a set of fraud monitoring and recovery services that provides assistance to consumers in detecting and recovering from identity theft 
welcome home sm tool kit a start to finish package for financial institution branch offices that captures best practices for securing lasting loyalty among customers by focusing on the first days of the relationship 
deluxe calling sm an outbound calling program aimed at helping financial institutions generate new organic revenue growth and reduce attrition 
realchecking tm program a system of deposit products  including reward checking programs  that drives non interest income  attracts new account holders and increases retention for community financial institutions 
we offer this suite of products to our clients through a partnership with bancvue  ltd 
which began in early marketing solutions a variety of strategic and tactical marketing solutions which help financial institutions acquire new customers  deepen existing customer relationships and retain customers 
we expect providing products and services that differentiate us from the competition will help partially offset the impacts of the decline in check usage and the pricing pressures we are experiencing in our check programs 
as such  we are also focused on accelerating the pace at which we introduce new products and services 
in addition to our other value added services  we continue to offer our knowledge exchange tm series  a suite of resources and events for our financial institution clients focused on the customer experience 
direct checks our strategies within direct checks are as follows optimize cash flow  maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features  accessories and products  and continue to optimize our cost and expense structure 
we intend to optimize the cash flow generated by this segment by continuing to lower our cost and expense structure in all functional areas  particularly in the areas of marketing and fulfillment 
we will continue to actively market our products and services through targeted advertising 
we have been and will continue to focus a greater portion of our advertising investment on e commerce 
additionally  we continue to explore avenues to increase sales to existing customers 
for example  we have had success with the ezshield tm product  a check protection service that provides reimbursement to consumers for losses resulting from forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks 
cost reduction initiatives we have been pursuing aggressive cost reduction and business simplification initiatives  including reducing shared services infrastructure costs  streamlining our call center and fulfillment activities  eliminating system and work stream redundancies  reducing advertising costs  and strengthening our ability to quickly develop new products and services and bring them to market 
we have been reducing stock keeping units skus  standardizing products and services and improving the sourcing of third party goods and services 
during  we closed seven manufacturing facilities and two customer call centers 
during  we closed one manufacturing facility and one customer call center  and we closed one customer call center during we plan to close one additional customer call center by the end of the first quarter of these and other actions since collectively are expected to reduce our annual cost structure by at least million  net of required investments  by the end of the baseline for these anticipated savings is the annual diluted earnings per share guidance for of to  which we provided in our press release on july  regarding second quarter results 
we expect all three of our business segments to benefit from the cost reductions 
we estimate that approximately of the million target will come from reorganizing our sales and marketing functions and that another of the target will come from our shared services infrastructure organizations of information technology  real estate  finance and human resources 
we expect information technology will provide the greatest percentage of the shared services savings through lowering data center costs  improving mainframe and server utilization and reducing the cost of networking and voice communications 
we also estimate that approximately of the million target will come from fulfillment  including manufacturing and supply chain 
overall  approximately one third of the savings are expected to affect cost of goods sold  with the remaining two thirds impacting selling  general and administrative sg a expense 

table of contents through december   we estimate that we have realized approximately million of our million target 
we anticipate that we will realize the remaining million in outlook for we anticipate that consolidated revenue from continuing operations will be between billion and billion for  as compared to billion for in small business services  we expect the revenue decline percentage to be in the low single digits to flat range as declines in core business products are expected to be offset by the benefits of our e commerce investments and growth in business services offerings  including acquisitions 
in financial services  we expect check order declines of approximately seven to eight percent compared to  given the continued turmoil in the financial services industry  including a higher number of bank failures  as well as increases in electronic payments and the weak economy 
we expect the related revenue pressure in financial services will be partially offset by a price increase implemented in the third quarter of  as well as continued contributions from our loyalty  retention  and fraud monitoring and protection offers 
we have reached an agreement with a new national financial institution client  which we expect will begin generating revenue in the last half of in december  we also executed a contract settlement agreement with another national financial institution client which was acquired by another financial institution 
we currently estimate that we will continue providing products under this contract through june we do not anticipate that the net impact of this client gain and client loss will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in direct checks  we expect the revenue decline percentage to be in the very low double digit to very high single digit range compared to  driven by the decline in check usage and the weak economy  partly offset by improved reorder cycles 
we expect that diluted earnings per share will be between and  compared to for earnings per share for included a per share impact of impairment charges  restructuring and transaction related costs  and gains on debt repurchases 
we expect that continued progress with our cost reduction initiatives will be offset by the revenue decline  continued investments in revenue growth opportunities and increases in material and delivery rates 
our outlook reflects a merit wage freeze in  leaving base salary levels consistent with we estimate that our annual effective tax rate for will be approximately  compared to in we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations will be between million and million in  compared to million in we anticipate that higher performance based compensation payments in will be partly offset by higher earnings  continued progress on working capital initiatives and lower contract acquisition payments 
we estimate that capital spending will be approximately million in as we continue to expand our use of digital printing technology  complete automation of our flat check packaging process and make other investments in order fulfillment  delivery productivity and information technology infrastructure 
we believe our committed line of credit  which expires in july  along with cash generated by operating activities and a replacement line of credit  will be sufficient to support our operations  including capital expenditures  small to medium sized acquisitions  required debt service and dividend payments  for the next months 
we anticipate that we will replace our existing committed line of credit well in advance of its july maturity date 
as we negotiate a replacement line of credit  the current unfavorable credit environment and our current credit profile will result in higher interest rates and or terms which are not as favorable to us as our existing line of credit agreement 
additionally  based on our current credit profile  we anticipate that amounts borrowed under a new line of credit agreement will be secured by certain of our assets 
with no long term debt maturities until  we are focused on a disciplined approach to capital deployment that focuses on our need to continue investing in initiatives to drive revenue growth  including small to medium sized acquisitions 
we also anticipate that our board of directors will maintain our current dividend level 
however  dividends are approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and thus  are subject to change 
to the extent we have cash flow in excess of these priorities  our focus in will be on further reducing debt 
during  we retired million of long term notes and we re paid million borrowed under our committed line of credit 

table of contents business challenges market risks market for checks and business forms the market for our two largest products  checks and business forms  is very competitive 
these products are mature and their use has been declining 
according to our estimates  the total number of checks written in the united states has been in decline as a result of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  automated teller machines  direct deposit  and electronic and other bill paying services 
according to a federal reserve study released in december  approximately billion checks are written annually 
this includes checks which are converted to automated clearing house ach payments 
the check remains the largest single non cash payment method in the united states  accounting for approximately of all non cash payment transactions 
this is a reduction from the federal reserve study released in december when checks accounted for approximately of all non cash payment transactions 
the federal reserve estimates that checks written declined approximately four percent per year between and according to our estimates  the decline was greater in and  we believe  due to the economic recession and instability in the financial services industry 
the total transaction volume of all electronic payment methods exceeds check payments  and we expect this to continue 
in addition to the decline in check usage  the use of business forms is also under pressure 
our previous estimates indicated that the business check and forms portion of the markets serviced by small business services was declining at a rate of four to six percent per year  although we believe the decline was greater in due to the economic recession 
continual technological improvements provide small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  off the shelf business software applications and electronic transaction systems have been designed to replace pre printed business forms products 
financial institution clients because check usage is declining and financial institutions have been consolidating  we have been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
our traditional financial institution relationships are typically formalized through supply contracts averaging four to six years in duration 
as we compete to retain and acquire new financial institution business  the resulting pricing pressure  combined with declining check usage in the marketplace  has reduced our revenue and profit margins 
we expect this trend to continue 
continued turmoil in the financial services industry  including further bank failures and consolidations  could have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations if we were to lose a significant contract and or we were unable to recover the value of unamortized contract acquisition costs or accounts receivable 
as of december   unamortized contract acquisition costs totaled million  while liabilities for contract acquisition costs not paid as of december  were million 
the inability to recover amounts paid to one or more of our larger financial institution clients could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
additionally  if two of our financial institution clients were to consolidate  the increase in general negotiating leverage possessed by the consolidated entity could result in a new contract which is not as favorable to us as those historically negotiated with the clients individually 
we may also lose significant business if one of our financial institution clients were taken over by a financial institution which is not one of our clients 
however  in this situation  we may be able to collect a contract termination payment 
conversely  further bank consolidations could positively impact our results of operations if we were to obtain business from a non client financial institution that merges with one of our clients 
we may also generate non recurring conversion revenue when obsolete checks have to be replaced after one financial institution merges with or acquires another 
we presently do not have specific information that indicates that we should expect to generate significant income from conversions 
economic conditions general economic conditions negatively impacted our results of operations 
the rate of small business formations and small business confidence impact small business services 
the index of small business optimism published by the national federation of independent business in december was up only slightly from the near record low recorded in march according to estimates of the small business administration s office of advocacy  new small business formations were down moderately in  the most recent period for which information is available  as compared to consumer spending and employment levels also have some impact on our personal check businesses 
both measures trended negatively during  and we did experience some negative impact in our personal check businesses 
we expect that general economic conditions will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations 
a continued downturn in general economic conditions could result in additional declines in our revenue and profitability 

table of contents continued declines in our stock price  as well as a continuing negative impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results  led to asset impairment charges in early related to goodwill and an indefinite lived trade name in our small business services segment 
if our stock price declines in the future for a sustained period or if we are required to reduce our forecasted operating results because of a continued downturn in economic conditions  it may be indicative of a further decline in our fair value and could require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and or our indefinite lived trade name 
for further information regarding the impairment analyses completed during  see the goodwill and indefinite lived assets discussion under application of critical accounting policies 
consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements direct checks and portions of small business services have  at times  been impacted by reduced consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements 
our own experience indicates that declines in our customer response rates may be attributable to the decline in check usage  the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and a general decline in direct marketing response rates due  in part  to increasing utilization of e commerce by both consumers and small businesses 
we continually evaluate our marketing techniques in order to utilize the most effective and affordable advertising media and have recently shifted a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet 
postretirement benefit plan the fair value of the plan assets of our postretirement benefit plan is subject to various risks  including credit  interest and overall market volatility risks 
during  the equity markets experienced a significant decline in value 
as such  the fair value of our plan assets decreased significantly during the year  resulting in a million increase in the unfunded status of our plan as compared to the end of the previous year 
this affected the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and also contributed to an increase in postretirement benefit expense of million in  as compared to as of december   the fair value of our plan assets had partially recovered  contributing to an million improvement in the unfunded status of our plan as compared to december  if the equity and bond markets decline in future periods  the funded status of our plan could again be materially affected 
this could result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future  as well as the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund the benefits payable under the plan  although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable 
we did not use plan assets to make benefit payments during and rather  we used cash provided by operating activities to make these payments 
consolidated results of operations consolidated revenue change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except per order amounts revenue orders revenue per order the decrease in revenue for  as compared to  was due to lower order volume in each of our segments 
partially offsetting the volume declines were sales of products and services by businesses we acquired in and  as discussed under executive overview  as well as price increases implemented by all three segments 
also  sales of fraud protection services increased in small business services and direct checks during the number of orders decreased for  as compared to  due primarily to general economic conditions which we believe affected our customers buying patterns  the continuing decline in check and forms usage  and turmoil in the financial services industry  including a higher number of bank failures 
partially offsetting these volume declines were sales of products and services by businesses we acquired in and the decline in orders  excluding the acquired businesses  was for  as compared to revenue per order decreased for  as compared to  primarily due to continued pricing pressure within financial services  partially offset by the benefit of 
table of contents price increases 
also impacting revenue per order were sales of products and services by businesses we acquired in and the acquisitions reduced revenue per order by percentage points for  as compared to  primarily because we consider each monthly billing generated for web services to be an order  which results in lower revenue per order 
the decrease in revenue for  as compared to  was due to lower order volume in each of our segments and lower revenue per order for financial services due to continued pricing pressure 
partially offsetting these revenue decreases were sales of products and services by businesses we acquired in  higher revenue per order for direct checks due to price increases and increased sales of fraud protection services  as well as the benefit of financial services price increases in and sales of fraud protection services also increased in small business services during the number of orders decreased for  as compared to  due to volume declines for direct checks and financial services  primarily due to the decline in check usage  as well as unfavorable economic conditions primarily affecting small business services

consolidated gross margin change vs 
vs 
in thousands gross profit gross margin pt 
pt 
we evaluate gross margin when analyzing our consolidated results of operations as we believe it provides important insight into significant profit drivers 
as more than of our revenue at this time is generated from the sale of manufactured and purchased products  the measure of gross margin best demonstrates our manufacturing and distribution performance  as well as the impact of pricing on our profitability 
gross margin is not a complete measure of profitability  as it omits sg a expense 
however  it is a financial measure which is useful in evaluating our results of operations 

table of contents gross margin increased for  as compared to  due primarily to a decrease of million in restructuring charges and other costs related to our cost reduction initiatives 
further information regarding our restructuring costs can be found under restructuring costs 
the lower charges for restructuring and related costs in increased our gross margin for by percentage points  as compared to also contributing to the gross margin increase were manufacturing efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our cost reduction initiatives  as well as price increases 
partially offsetting these increases were higher material and delivery rates  as well as higher performance based compensation expense related to our performance 
gross margin decreased for  as compared to  due primarily to a million increase in restructuring charges and other costs related to our cost reduction initiatives 
the restructuring charges and related costs reduced our gross margin for by percentage points 
additionally  higher delivery related costs from mid and postal rate increases and fuel surcharges in  higher materials costs due to an unfavorable product mix  as well as competitive pricing in financial services negatively affected gross margin 
these decreases were partially offset by price increases for direct checks and financial services  as well as manufacturing efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our cost reduction initiatives 
consolidated selling  general administrative expense change vs 
vs 
in thousands sg a expense sg a expense as a percentage of revenue pt 
pt 
the decrease in sg a expense for  as compared to  was due primarily to various cost reduction initiatives within our shared services organizations  primarily within sales and marketing and information technology 
partially offsetting these decreases were expenses from the businesses we acquired  an increase of approximately million in performance based compensation expense related to our performance  as well as higher benefit costs related primarily to workers compensation claims activity and retiree medical costs 
the decrease in sg a expense for  as compared to  was primarily due to various cost reduction initiatives within our shared services organizations  primarily within sales and marketing and information technology  a reduction of approximately million in performance based employee compensation and lower employee benefit costs related to reduced workers compensation and medical claims activity 
these decreases in sg a expense were partially offset by investments to drive revenue growth opportunities  including marketing costs within small business services and information technology investments

the charges for all periods included severance benefits and other direct costs of our initiatives  including equipment moves  training and travel

additional restructuring charges of million in and million in were included within cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income

in thousands asset impairment charges as of march   we completed impairment analyses of goodwill and an indefinite lived trade name due to declines in our stock price during the first quarter of coupled with the continuing negative impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
we recorded non cash asset impairment charges in our small business services segment of million related to goodwill and million related to the indefinite lived trade name 
during the third quarter of  we completed our annual impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million related to two indefinite lived trade names in our small business services segment resulting from the impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results and the broader effects of us market conditions on the fair value of the assets 
we completed additional impairment analyses as of december   based on the continuing impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
as a result  we recorded an additional asset impairment charge of million related to the nebs trade name during the fourth quarter of  bringing the carrying value of this asset to million as of december  the impairment analyses completed as of december   indicated no additional impairment of our other indefinite lived trade name and indicated no impairment of goodwill 
because of the further deterioration in our expected operating results  we determined that the nebs trade name no longer had an indefinite life  and thus  we began amortizing it over its estimated economic life of years on the straight line basis beginning in although the use of checks and forms is declining  revenues generated from our small business services strategies have  and we expect will continue to  offset a portion of the decline in revenues and cash flows generated from the sale of checks and forms 
as such  we believe that the sale of checks and forms  as well as the sale of additional products and services under the nebs trade name  will generate sufficient cash flows to support our estimated year economic life for this intangible asset 
in addition to the impairment charges related to the indefinite lived trade names  we also recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of related to an amortizable trade name 
this impairment resulted from a change in our branding strategy

the decrease in interest expense for  as compared to  was due to our lower average debt level in  as well as our lower weighted average interest rate 
during the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of our long term debt 
these fair value hedges reduced interest expense by million in due to the early retirement of long term notes during the first quarter of  we were required to accelerate the recognition of a portion of a derivative loss

the increase in our effective tax rate for  as compared to  was largely due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge in  a portion of which was non deductible 
partially offsetting this increase in our effective tax rate were favorable discrete adjustments in which lowered our effective tax rate percentage points

table of contents the impact of restructuring costs and asset impairment charges in and interest earned on tax exempt investments in restructuring costs during  we recorded net restructuring charges of million 
this amount included expenses related to our restructuring activities  including items such as equipment moves  training and travel which were expensed as incurred  as well as net restructuring accruals of million 
the net restructuring accruals included charges of million related to severance for employee reductions in various functional areas  including the planned closing of one customer call center in the first quarter of and further consolidation in the sales  marketing and fulfillment organizations  as well as operating lease obligations on three manufacturing facilities closed during these actions were the result of our cost reduction initiatives 
the net restructuring accruals included severance benefits for employees 
further information regarding our cost reduction initiatives can be found under executive overview 
these charges were reduced by the reversal of million of restructuring accruals primarily recorded in as fewer employees received severance benefits than originally estimated 
the restructuring charges were reflected as net restructuring charges of million within cost of goods sold and net restructuring charges of million within operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income 
in addition to the amounts reflected in the net restructuring charges captions in the consolidated statement of income  we incurred approximately million of other restructuring related costs during  such as labor redundancies during the closing of facilities

of this amount  million related to accruals  primarily for employee severance  while the remainder included other expenses related to our restructuring activities  including the write off of spare parts  the acceleration of employee share based compensation expense  equipment moves  training and travel 
our restructuring accruals for severance benefits related to the closing of six manufacturing facilities and two customer call centers  as well as employee reductions within our business unit support and corporate shared services functions  primarily sales  marketing and fulfillment 
these actions were the result of the continuous review of our cost structure in response to the impact a weakened us economy continued to have on our business  as well as our previously announced cost reduction initiatives 
the restructuring accruals included severance benefits for  employees 
the other costs related to our restructuring activities were expensed as incurred 
we recorded a million write off of the carrying value of spare parts used on our offset printing presses 
during a review of our cost structure  we made the decision to expand our use of the digital printing process 
as such  a portion of the spare parts kept on hand for use on our offset printing presses was written down to zero  as these parts have no future use or market value 
the spare parts were included in other non current assets in our consolidated balance sheet and the write down was included in restructuring charges within cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income

table of contents financial position contract acquisition costs other non current assets include contract acquisition costs of our financial services segment

cash payments made for contract acquisition costs were million in  million in and million in we anticipate cash payments of approximately million in changes in contract acquisition costs during the last three years were as follows in thousands balance  beginning of year additions amortization balance  end of year the number of checks being written has been in decline since the mid s  which has contributed to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or acquire clients 
both the number of financial institution clients requesting contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments increased in the mid s  and has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
although we anticipate that we will selectively continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid depends on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  competitors actions  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
when the overall discount level provided for in a contract is unchanged  contract acquisition costs do not result in lower net revenue 
these payments impact the timing of cash flows 
an up front cash payment is made rather than providing higher product discount levels throughout the term of the contract

off balance sheet arrangements  guarantees and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements or to guarantee the performance of third parties 
in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as product or service defects  including breach of security  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of terms of the contract

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
our accounting policies are discussed under the caption note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
application of critical accounting policies we consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions could be material to our consolidated financial statements

goodwill and our indefinite lived trade name are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
in addition to the required impairment analyses  we regularly evaluate the remaining useful life of our indefinite lived trade name to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if we determine that this asset has a finite useful life  we test the asset for impairment and then amortize the asset s remaining carrying value over its estimated remaining useful life 
further information regarding the fair value measurements completed during is provided under the caption note fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
during the first quarter of  we completed impairment analyses of goodwill and our indefinite lived trade name due to declines in our stock price coupled with the continuing negative impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
we also completed our annual impairment analyses during the third quarter of no impairment analyses were required during the second or fourth quarters of  as there were no indicators of potential impairment during the quarters 
although there were declines in our revenue and operating income compared to the comparable prior year periods  this was consistent with our operating plan and not indicative of impairment 
the estimate of fair value for the indefinite lived trade name is based on a relief from royalty method  which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name 
an assumed royalty rate is applied to forecasted revenue and the resulting cash flows are discounted 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
during the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million in our small business services segment related to our indefinite lived trade name 
our annual impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of indicated that the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived trade name was million  compared to its carrying value of million 
in this analysis  we assumed a discount rate of and a royalty rate of 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million and a one half percentage point decrease in the royalty rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million 
a two step approach is used in evaluating goodwill for impairment 
first  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of its net assets 
in calculating fair value  we use the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
the discount rate used is the value weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units we are required to estimate a number of factors  including projected future operating results  terminal growth rates  economic conditions  anticipated future cash flows  the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items 
for reasonableness  the summation of our reporting units fair values is compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by 
table of contents our market capitalization plus an appropriate control premium 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis requires us to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the goodwill  we measure the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our small business services segment related to one of our reporting units 
the annual impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of indicated that the calculated fair values of our reporting units net assets exceeded the carrying values of their net assets by amounts between million and million  or by amounts between and above their carrying values 
if our stock price declines in the future for a sustained period or if we are required to significantly reduce our forecasted operating results because of a continuing downturn in economic conditions  it may be indicative of a further decline in our fair value and could require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and or our indefinite lived trade name 
as a result of the annual impairment analyses completed during the third quarter of  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million related to two indefinite lived trade names in our small business services segment due to the impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results and the broader effects of us market conditions on the fair value of the assets 
we completed additional impairment analyses as of december   based on the continuing impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
as a result  we recorded an additional asset impairment charge of million related to the nebs trade name during the fourth quarter of  bringing the carrying value of this asset to million as of december  the impairment analyses completed as of december  indicated no additional impairment of our other indefinite lived trade name 
because of the further deterioration in our expected operating results  we determined that the nebs trade name no longer has an indefinite life  and thus  we began amortizing it over its estimated economic life of years on the straight line basis beginning in although the use of checks and forms is declining  revenues generated from our small business services strategies have  and we expect will continue to  offset a portion of the decline in revenues and cash flows generated from the sale of checks and forms 
as such  we believe that the sale of checks and forms  as well as the sale of additional products and services under the nebs trade name  will generate sufficient cash flows to support our estimated year economic life for this intangible asset 
this asset is no longer subject to annual impairment testing  but will be tested for impairment in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangibles  as outlined under the caption note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
in addition to the impairment of indefinite lived trade names  we also recorded a million non cash impairment charge during related to an amortizable trade name due to a change in our branding strategy 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows and revenues over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
if these estimates and assumptions change  we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in interim reporting periods  we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate based on the facts available at the time 
changes in the mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact our estimated effective tax rate in interim periods 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the interim period during which the unusual or one time item occurred 
the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
tax laws require certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our 
table of contents consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense  net of the expected tax benefit  in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we had deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets of million as of december   including valuation allowances of million 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million  including valuation allowances of million 
the valuation allowances relate primarily to canadian operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize 
on a regular basis  our income tax returns are reviewed by various domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  we record accruals for items which we believe may be challenged by these taxing authorities 
the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements is that they must be more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in our consolidated financial statements  million would affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   we had accrued million of interest and penalties  excluding the tax benefit of deductible interest 
the statute of limitations for federal tax assessments for and prior years has closed  with the exception of our federal income tax returns for and are currently being audited by the internal revenue service irs and our federal income tax returns for  and remain subject to irs examination 
in general  income tax returns for the years through remain subject to examination by major state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdiction 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution would result in reduced income tax expense 
changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the last three years can be found under the caption note income tax provision of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
within the next months  it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will change in the range of a decrease of million to an increase of million as we attempt to settle certain federal and state matters or as federal and state statutes of limitations expire 
we are not able to predict what  if any  impact these changes may have on our effective tax rate or cash flows 
we reduced our income tax provision million in  million in and million in for amendments to prior year tax returns claiming refunds primarily associated with federal and state tax credits and the funding of medical costs through our veba trust  as well as the related interest 
also during  we reduced our income tax provision million for the settlement of amounts due to us under a tax sharing agreement related to the spin off of our efunds business in postretirement benefit plan detailed information regarding our postretirement benefit plan  including a description of the plan  its related future cash flows  plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used in accounting for the plan  can be found under the caption note pension and other postretirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
our net postretirement benefit expense was million for and million for and our business segments record postretirement benefit expense in cost of goods sold and sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our postretirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected health care cost trend rate and the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 
we analyze the assumptions used each year when we complete our actuarial valuation of the plan 
the effects of changes to our assumptions are recognized immediately on the consolidated balance sheet  but are generally amortized into earnings over 
table of contents future periods 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our postretirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods are impacted 
discount rate the discount rate is used to reflect the time value of money 
it is the assumed rate at which future postretirement benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the hewitt top quartile and the citigroup pension discount yield curves to discount each cash flow stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present value of each cash flow stream is aggregated and used to impute a weighted average discount rate 
prior to  we also considered moody s high quality corporate bond rates when selecting our discount rate 
however  as the number of bonds included in this index fell significantly during and those bonds do not match the timing of our expected cash flows as well  we no longer utilize these rates 
the discount rate established at year end for purposes of calculating our benefit obligation is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit expense for the following year 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would not impact our annual postretirement benefit expense  but would increase or decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
in determining this rate  we utilize our historical returns and then adjust these returns for estimated inflation 
our inflation assumption is primarily based on analysis of historical inflation data 
in measuring net postretirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
expected health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be 
our ultimate health care inflation rate was assumed to be in and beyond 
a one percentage point increase in the health care inflation rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual postretirement benefit expense by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the health care inflation rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual postretirement benefit expense by million 
average remaining life expectancy of plan participants in determining the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants  our actuaries use a mortality table which includes estimated death rates for each age 
we use the rp combined healthy participant table projected to the measurement date with scale aa in determining this assumption 
when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
the gain or loss is recognized immediately in the consolidated balance sheet within accumulated comprehensive loss and is amortized into postretirement benefit expense 
effective april   we amended our postretirement benefit plan to decrease the minimum age for eligibility to receive the maximum available benefits from age to age and to decrease the service requirement for maximum retiree cost sharing from years to years 
prior to the april  plan amendment and re measurement  unrecognized actuarial gains and losses were being amortized over the average remaining service period of plan participants  which was years as of december  because the plan amendment increased the number of participants currently eligible to receive the maximum available benefits  almost all of the plan participants were classified as inactive subsequent to the plan amendment 
as such  actuarial gains and losses are required to be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants  which was years as of april  this change resulted in a million decrease in postretirement benefit expense for  as compared to the expense we had expected for prior to the plan amendments

table of contents restructuring accruals over the past several years  we have recorded restructuring accruals as a result of facility closings and other cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
these accruals primarily consist of employee termination benefits payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we record accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
as such  judgment is involved in determining when it is appropriate to record restructuring accruals 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and assumptions in calculating the restructuring accruals  as on some occasions employees choose to voluntarily leave the company prior to their termination date or they secure another position within the company 
in these situations  the employees do not receive termination benefits 
to the extent our assumptions and estimates differ from our actual costs  subsequent adjustments to restructuring accruals have been and will be required 
we reversed previously recorded restructuring accruals of million in  million in and million in primarily as a result of fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated 
further information regarding our restructuring accruals can be found under the caption note restructuring charges of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of the borrowing activities used to support our capital structure  maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during  we used our committed line of credit to fund working capital  acquisitions and debt service requirements 
the nature and amount of debt outstanding can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of december   our total debt was comprised of the following fair weighted average in thousands carrying amount value interest rate long term notes maturing december long term notes maturing october long term notes maturing june amounts drawn on line of credit total debt based on quoted market prices as of december  for identical liabilities when traded as assets  with the exception of amounts drawn on our line of credit for which fair value equals carrying value due to its short term nature 
we may  from time to time  consider retiring outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges would depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements and other potential uses of cash  including acquisitions or share repurchases 
in september  we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of our ten year bonds due in we entered into these swaps  which we designated as fair value hedges  to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt  where we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the related long term debt are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
when the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the hedged debt are not equal ie  hedge ineffectiveness  the difference in the changes in fair value affects the reported amount of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
hedge ineffectiveness was not material for the fair value of the interest rate swaps as of december  was million and is included in other non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on the outstanding variable rate debt in our portfolio  a one percentage point change in interest rates would have resulted in a million change in interest expense for  excluding the impact of the interest rate swaps 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
investments in  loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches  as well as the operations of these businesses  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar 
the effect of exchange rate changes is expected to have a minimal impact on our results of operations and cash flows  as our foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of our business
