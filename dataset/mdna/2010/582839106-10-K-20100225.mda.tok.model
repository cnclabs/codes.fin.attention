overview of our business we are a global leader in pediatric nutrition

we have over years of innovation experience during which we have developed or improved many breakthrough or industry defining products across each of our product categories 
we operate in four geographic regions asia  latin america  north america and europe 
due to similarities in the economics  products offered  production process  customer base and regulatory environment  these operating regions have been aggregated into two reportable segments asia latin america and north america europe 
executive summary in  mead johnson nutrition company went from being a wholly owned division of bristol myers squibb company bms to a separately traded  independent public company 
in february  we issued million shares of our common stock in an initial public offering ipo resulting in million shares of common stock outstanding  of which million was owned by bms 
on december   bms disposed of its entire ownership interest in us through an exchange offer with its shareholders 
all of our common stock is now publicly held 
in november  we issued billion of notes through a private placement and used the net proceeds  along with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash  to repay our debt obligations to bms totaling billion 
our operating results are driven by a number of factors including  pediatric nutrition industry growth  favorable demographic trends  especially in emerging markets  economic and other factors affecting the number of babies born each year  our ability to hold or gain market share and to sustain the strength of our brand franchise  the success of new product innovations  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  growth through geographic expansion  the success of our on going productivity efforts  changes in the cost of raw materials and other commodities  principally dairy  our ability to increase prices  and foreign exchange rate movements 
during  we reported strong growth in our asia and latin america markets  resulting in share gains in many countries within that segment 
we continued to invest in high growth markets in asia and latin america  particularly in china  by adding to our sales force as we expand into new cities and by supporting those efforts through product innovation and increased investments in advertising and promotion 
the us market contracted in due to fewer births and our us business also lost market share 
we have begun to see our us business stabilize  benefitting from the success of new products launched in  backed by increased investments in marketing  advertising and promotion 
during  we benefited from lower commodity costs  however  dairy prices started increasing toward the end of the year  which we expect to adversely affect our gross profits in during  we also initiated a global infrastructure redesign project 
we expect to transition  replace or retire the information technology systems  administration and outsourced services provided to us by bms  via transition services agreements 
once this multi year project is complete and we have fully separated from bms information technology and shared service functions  we believe our cost structure will be more efficient
