item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and also with certain risks in item of this report 
certain amounts in prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation 
this discussion also includes forward looking statements 
please refer to cautionary information about forward looking statements in part i of this report for important information about these types of statements 
overview we are an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations entirely located in the united states 
we have determined that our business is comprised of only one segment because our gathering  processing and marketing activities are ancillary to our production operations and are not separately managed 
our operating strategy is to achieve profitable growth in proved reserves and production primarily through exploration and development 
to supplement our growth and to provide for new drilling opportunities  we also consider mergers and acquisitions 
our growth is generally funded with cash flow provided by our operating activities 
to achieve a consistent rate of growth and mitigate risk we have historically maintained a blended portfolio of low  moderate  and higher risk exploration and development projects 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
our operations are mainly located in texas  oklahoma  new mexico  kansas and wyoming 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets  liabilities and proved reserves 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
our revenue  profitability and future growth are highly dependent on the oil and gas prices we receive 
our ability to find  develop and or acquire proved oil and gas reserves will also impact our financial results 
continued volatility in commodity prices  and turmoil in the global financial system may have adverse effects on our business and financial position 
our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
further  the global economic situation could have an impact on our lenders  business partners and customers  potentially causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
oil and gas prices reached historically high levels during the first nine months of however  during the fourth quarter of severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity caused significant decreases in oil and gas prices 
the downward pressure on natural gas prices continued in our average realized natural gas price for decreased compared to the realized price 
oil prices improved as unfolded but they are still significantly lower than prices received in our average realized oil price during was lower than the realized price for this dramatic decrease in both oil and gas prices had a significant negative impact on our revenue and net income 
we also had less cash flow available for capital expenditures 
our stock price and market capitalization have also been adversely affected by these economic events 
summary lower oil and gas prices negatively impacted our revenues  earnings and cash flow 
we reported a net loss of million  or per share 
the loss was primarily the result of a first quarter full cost ceiling test write down of our oil and gas properties of million after tax 
substantially all 
table of contents of this noncash charge was the result of the continuing drop in commodity prices that began during the fourth quarter of despite the impact of lower prices  we made several meaningful accomplishments during most notably  we increased our proved reserves by and have positioned the company to achieve production volume growth in summary financial and operating results proved reserves increased to tcfe 
oil and gas production volumes averaged mmcfe d  down from mmcfe d for oil and gas sales declined to million from billion a year earlier 
net loss of million  or per diluted share  versus a loss of million  or per share in cash flow from operating activities was million  down from  million for total debt decreased by million to million from million at year end in response to the lower oil and gas prices we significantly reduced our capital expenditures from our record high in total oil and gas capital expenditures for were million  down from expenditures of billion 
in october our bank group  as part of the regularly scheduled fall review  reaffirmed our billion borrowing base related to our credit facility maturing in april bank group commitments of million also remain unchanged 
as of december   we had bank borrowings outstanding of million  which is million less than the december  balance of million 
the reduction in borrowings was primarily funded from non core property sales and tax refunds 
we sold various interests in oil and gas properties in  the largest of which was a west texas secondary oil recovery field 
total sales proceeds were million  with associated proved reserves of bcfe 
there were no significant acquisitions during subsequent to year end we acquired additional interests in our western oklahoma cana woodford shale play for approximately million 
oil and gas prices while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in commodity prices had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
our annual average realized gas price decreased from per mcf in to per mcf in  and oil prices decreased from per barrel in to per barrel in during the fourth quarter of  reductions in global economic activity and energy demands caused significant decreases in oil and gas prices 
year end oil and gas prices fell from their mid peak 
though prices improved as unfolded  they remained substantially below prior year levels 
years ended december  gas prices average henry hub price mcf average realized sales price mcf effect of hedges mcf oil prices average wti cushing price bbl average realized sales price bbl 
table of contents on an energy equivalent basis  of our aggregate production was natural gas 
a per mcf change in our average realized gas sales price would have resulted in approximately an million change in our gas revenues 
similarly  of our production was crude oil 
a per barrel change in our average realized crude oil sales price would have resulted in approximately an million change in our oil revenues 
hedging in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  economic and geo political factors that we can neither control nor predict 
from time to time we attempt to mitigate a portion of our price risk through the use of hedging transactions 
in march we entered into derivative gas contracts covering the period april through december the collars set a floor of and a ceiling of and covered approximately  mmbtu per day of our mid continent gas production during the contract period 
these contracts expired at december  we recognized a net gain of million from the contracts 
for and we executed cash flow effective hedges covering approximately of our overall gas production and of our gas volumes 
we hedged million mmbtu and million mmbtu for and  respectively 
as of december  all of our cash flow effective hedge contracts had expired 
during the second and third quarters of we entered into derivative contracts for a portion of our production 
these contracts cover approximately of our anticipated oil and gas production volumes 
at december   we had the following outstanding contracts natural gas contracts weighted average price period type volume day index floor ceiling swap jan dec collar  mmbtu pepl jan dec swap  mmbtu pepl jan dec collar  mmbtu hsc oil contracts weighted average price period type volume day index floor ceiling jan dec collar  bbls wti jan dec put floor  bbls wti pepl refers to panhandle eastern pipe line company price and hsc refers to houston ship channel price  both as quoted in platt s inside ferc on the first business day of each month 
wti refers to west texas intermediate price as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
we did not choose to apply hedge accounting treatment to any of the and contracts 
settlements on these contracts will not impact our realized commodity prices during the periods they cover 
instead  any settlements on these contracts are shown as a component of operating costs and expenses as a realized gain loss on derivative instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 

table of contents reserve replacement and growth due to lower oil and gas prices we sharply reduced our capital investments during in  investments in oil and gas exploration  development and acquisition activities totaled million versus billion in our exploration and development capital investment is expected to increase to million in  depending on prices and corresponding cash flow 
because oil and gas are non renewable forms of energy resources  exploration and production companies face the challenge of resource depletion and natural production decline 
our operations also entail significant complexities that require the use of advanced technologies and highly trained personnel 
even when modern exploration technology is properly used  our geo scientists still may not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present  the rate at which they will be produced  or economic viability 
future growth will continue to depend upon our ability to economically add reserves in excess of production 
despite lower capital investment in  our year end total proved oil and gas reserves increased by to tcfe from tcfe at year end this increase is net of production of bcfe and property sales of bcfe 
reserves added from exploration and development and improved recovery totaled bcfe and bcfe were acquired via property purchases 
revisions of previous estimates added bcfe  comprised of bcfe from positive performance and lower operating costs  partially offset by bcfe from lower prices 
proved natural gas reserves at year end were tcf compared to tcf at year end natural gas comprised and of our total proved reserves at year end and  respectively 
our proved oil reserves at year end were mmbbls compared to mmbbls at the end of overall  about of our proved reserves are in our mid continent region and are in the permian basin 
our onshore gulf coast and other onshore operations collectively make another of total proved reserves 
only of our total proved reserves are in the gulf of mexico 
the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex 
significant decisions are required in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data for our various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
see note  unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures for more reserve information 
in most years our primary source for reserve replacement and growth is exploration and development e d 
we invested million on e d during and  million in approximately of expenditures were in the mid continent area  in the permian basin  in the gulf coast area  and in wyoming other 
cash flow from operating activities for totaled million  which more than funded our drilling program 
production and other operating expenses the costs associated with finding and producing oil and gas are substantial 
some of these costs vary with oil and gas prices  some trend with production volume and some are a function of the number of wells we own 
at the end of  we owned interests in  wells 

table of contents production expense generally consists of the cost of power and fuel  direct labor  third party field services  compression  water disposal  and certain maintenance activity necessary to produce oil and gas from existing wells 
transportation expense is comprised of costs paid to move oil and gas from the wellhead to a specified sales point 
in some cases we receive a payment from purchasers which is net of transportation costs  and in other instances we separately pay for transportation 
if costs are netted in the proceeds received  both the gross revenues and gross costs are shown in sales and expenses  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of our producing properties is computed using the units of production method 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for future sales of production  fluctuations in oil and gas prices may impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion expense  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion expense 
in addition  changes in estimates of reserve quantities and estimates of future development costs or reclassifications from unproved properties to proved properties will impact depletion expense 
general and administrative expenses g a consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices and not directly associated with exploration  development or production activities 
while we expect these costs to increase with our growth  we also expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 
production taxes are assessed by state and local taxing authorities pertaining to production  revenues or the value of properties 
these typically include production severance  ad valorem and excise taxes 
significant expenses that generally do not trend with production stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and the expensing of stock options 
net stock compensation expense in was million compared to million in the derivative fair value gain loss is the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
the gain or loss fluctuates based on changes in the fair value of underlying commodities 
for the year ended december   we recognized a net realized gain of million for the contracts that settled and expired in for those contracts that cover the period january  to december  we have recorded a non cash fair value loss of million at december  results of operations compared to we recognized a net loss for of million or per share 
this compares to a net loss of million  or per share for the lower loss in compared to is primarily the result of a lower non cash full cost ceiling impairment write down recorded in compared to the write down

compared to  our oil production increased by one percent to an average of  barrels per day 
this increase resulted in million of incremental revenues 
gas volumes averaged mmcf per day in compared to mmcf per day in  resulting in a decrease in revenues of million 
total oil and gas production volumes were mmcfe per day  down mmcfe per day from during the fourth quarter of  our gas production averaged mmcf per day down from mmcf per day a six percent decrease from the fourth quarter of fourth quarter oil production decreased by four percent to  barrels per day from  barrels per day in the expected decrease in production volumes between the periods is primarily the result of reduced drilling 
our fourth quarter operated rig count averaged dropping to a low of three rigs in the first quarter of and averaged by the fourth quarter of average realized gas prices decreased by to per mcf in  compared to per mcf for this price decrease lowered gas sales by million between the two periods

volatility of oil and gas prices could require us to record a ceiling test impairment write down in future periods 
the full cost method of accounting is discussed in detail under critical accounting policies and estimates 
dd a decreased million between periods from million in to million in on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for the significant decrease is due to billion of impairments to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties recorded during the last half of and the first quarter of asset retirement obligation expense rose to million in from million in the increase is due to plugging and abandonment costs being greater than our original asset retirement obligation estimates 
this was primarily the result of hurricane damage to our offshore properties 
this caused additional expenses to be incurred during site restoration 
production costs decreased million  or percent  from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in our production costs consist of workover expense and lease operating expenses 
we have seen a decrease in costs in both of these areas 
a reduction in large scale workover projects caused a million decrease 
a decrease in lease operating expense of million is attributable to the sale of producing properties in the last half of and early coupled with a significant decline in service costs in comparison to their peak in mid transportation costs decreased from million in to million in the decrease is the result of lower sales volumes and lower fuel costs from to 
table of contents taxes other than income were million lower  dropping from million in to million in the decrease between periods resulted from decreases in oil and gas sales stemming from significantly lower commodity prices and lower gas production volumes 
general and administrative g a expenses decreased million from million in to million in the decrease between periods is due to higher employee benefit costs including bonus and severance costs  offset by lower legal costs and lower costs associated with having fewer employees 
a component of our operating costs and expenses in is a loss of million on our derivative instruments 
we recorded an unrealized loss of million related to calendar contracts which is partially offset by million of net realized gains on contract settlements in see note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding our derivative instruments 
other operating  net expense consists of costs related to various legal matters most of which pertain to litigation and contract settlements and title and royalty issues 
in  the decrease in other operating  net to million from million was primarily related to the tulsa county district court issuing a judgment in the hb krug case in the total accrued litigation expense for the year ended december  for this lawsuit was million 
we have appealed the district court s judgments 
for further information on this lawsuit and other litigation please see contingencies under critical accounting policies and estimates 
other income and expense interest expense increased by million  or  primarily because of an increase in our average bank debt outstanding during the year 
we had no borrowings on our credit facility during the first eleven months of and an average outstanding balance of approximately million during also  in comparison to  we recognized an additional million of deferred financing costs 
these higher costs are the result of the new credit facility we entered into in april partially offsetting these increases is a million decrease in interest expense on our convertible notes due to the december repurchases of million of the outstanding million face value notes 
we repurchased the notes with borrowings under our credit facility and recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt in capitalized interest increased by million due mostly to more costs associated with our unproved properties and construction project in other  net decreased from million of income in to million of expense in components consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including income and loss in equity investees  gain or loss on the sale or value of oil and gas well equipment  and interest income 
the change from to is primarily the result of losses of million related to oil and gas well equipment due to decreased value of drill pipe resulting from a significant slowing of drilling activity across the industry 
in we had a gain of million on the sale of oil and gas well equipment 
also included in our expense is a million loss on the sale of an equity investment 
income tax during  a net deferred income tax benefit of million was recognized the year end deferred tax benefit included million of current income tax benefit 
this compares with a net deferred income tax benefit of million 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were and in the years of and  respectively 
the effective tax rate of for differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and the domestic production activities allowance 

table of contents results of operations compared to we recognized a net loss for of million or per share 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share for the same period in the decrease in net income is primarily the result of a non cash full cost ceiling write down recorded in the third and fourth quarters of the full cost ceiling impairment is discussed further in the operating costs and expenses section below

as a result of further declines in natural gas and oil prices during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional non cash impairment of oil and gas properties 
electing to use period end prices  at december   our ceiling limitation calculation resulted in excess capitalized costs of billion billion after tax 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices and because the ceiling calculation requires that prices in effect as of the last day of the period be held constant in valuing proved reserves  we may be required to record a ceiling test write down in future periods 
the full cost method of accounting is discussed in detail under critical accounting policies and estimates 
dd a increased million between periods from million in to million in on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for 
table of contents the increase stems from replacement costs for reserves added being higher than costs of reserves produced 
service costs to drill and complete wells have been increasing and we are drilling deeper and more complex wells 
additionally  the significant decrease in oil and gas prices over the last half of reduced the amount of our estimated reserve quantities future production  causing an increase in our depletion rate 
due to the reduction to the carrying value of oil and gas properties recorded at year end we expect the dd a rate to be lower in the first quarter of in comparison to the full year production costs rose million  or nine percent  from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this increase resulted from an eight percent increase in production volumes and a million increase in workover expense between periods 
transportation costs increased from million in to million in the increase is the result of higher sales volumes  increased market rates and a higher fuel cost component due to higher natural gas prices during the year 
taxes other than income were million greater  rising from million in to million in the increase between periods resulted from increases in oil and gas sales stemming from higher production volumes and commodity prices 
general and administrative g a expenses decreased million from million in to million in the decrease between periods is due to lower employee benefit costs due to a decrease in bonus and profit sharing expenses resulting from significant decreases in commodity prices during the last quarter of in  the increase in other operating  net to million from million was primarily related to the tulsa county district court issuing a judgment in the hb krug case 
the total accrued litigation expense for the year ended december  for this lawsuit is million 
we have appealed the district court s judgments 
for further information on this lawsuit and other litigation please see contingencies under critical accounting policies and estimates 
other income and expense interest expense decreased by million  or  primarily because of a decrease in our average bank debt outstanding during the year 
in addition  in comparison to prior year  we experienced a decrease in our average interest rate on both our bank borrowings and convertible notes 
capitalized interest increased by million mainly because we had more costs incurred to develop our unproved properties than we had in we also had a loss on the repurchase of convertible notes of million compared to a million gain in on the early extinguishment of debt arising from redemption of our million face value of senior unsecured notes 
other  net decreased from million of income in to million of income in components consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including income and loss in equity investees  gain or loss on sale or value of oil and gas well equipment and interest income 
included in our other  net is million of impairment expense on our equity investments and million of impairment on our short term investments 
these additional expenses were offset by a million increase in gain on sale of oil and gas well equipment in comparison to another element of the decrease between periods is lower income of million from equity investees

table of contents tax rate of for differs from the statutory rate due to effects of the domestic production activities deduction and percentage depletion 
liquidity and capital resources overview the ongoing global economic slowdown has continued to impact commodity prices 
though prices improved as unfolded  they remained substantially below prior year levels 
volatility in commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce 
commodity prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures as well as our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
these conditions could impact third parties with whom we do business  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
we have and will continue to focus on maintaining liquidity and low financial leverage 
historically our exploration and development expenditures have generally been funded by cash flow provided by operating activities operating cash flow 
in we intend to continue to fund our exploration and development expenditures with operating cash flow 
we will also continue to consider attractive acquisition opportunities 
however  the timing and size of acquisitions is unpredictable 
to ready ourselves for potential acquisitions and possible further declines in commodity prices  we entered into a new three year senior secured revolving credit facility in april the new facility increased bank commitments from million to million 
the borrowing base is billion 
we believe that our operating cash flow and other capital resources will be adequate to continue to meet our needs for our planned capital expenditures  working capital  debt servicing  and dividend payments for and beyond 
sources and uses of cash our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flow from operating activities  occasional property sales  borrowings under our bank credit facility and public offerings of debt securities 
our primary uses of funds are exploration and development  property acquisitions  common stock dividends and occasional share repurchases 

table of contents the following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents from to the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis 
these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures including accruals that are referred to elsewhere in this document

the increase from to resulted primarily from higher gas prices  high oil prices and increased production 
cash flow used in investing activities for was million  compared to billion for and million for changes in the cash flow used in investing activities are generally the result of changes in our exploration and development programs  acquisitions and property sales 
the decrease from to was mostly caused by decreased oil and gas expenditures 
in response to the lower oil and gas prices at the end of  we significantly reduced our planned capital expenditures from our record high in the increase from to was caused by increased oil and gas expenditures resulting from a more active drilling program 
in addition  we had million less proceeds from sales of assets in when compared to net cash flow used in financing activities in was million versus net cash flow provided by financing activities of million in in we had net payments on our credit facility of million and million of financing costs for the new three year senior secured revolving credit facility 
in we had borrowings under our credit facility of million and million in proceeds from issuance of common stock and other 
also in we used million of the borrowings under 
table of contents our credit facility to repurchase a portion of our convertible notes in december 
we made dividend payments of approximately million in both and net cash flow used in financing activities in was million 
two significant uses were for share repurchases of million and million for dividends 
proceeds from our may issuance of million of ten year  senior unsecured notes were used to redeem our old notes and reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
capital expenditures the following table sets forth certain historical information regarding capitalized expenditures by us in our oil and gas acquisition  exploration  and development activities in thousands for years ended december  acquisitions proved unproved exploration and development land seismic exploration development property sales the negative balance reflects purchase price adjustments related to an acreage acquisition in the fourth quarter of our exploration and development expenditures decreased percent in compared to the decrease in resulted from a planned decrease in our exploration activity in response to the economic environment and our continued efforts to operate within our cash flow provided by operating activities 
overall  we drilled and completed gross net wells during versus gross net wells in at year end an additional gross net cana woodford wells were waiting on completion 
our planned capital program for will range from million 
although our capital budget is set at a level that we believe corresponds with our anticipated cash flows  the timing of capital expenditures and the receipt of cash flows do not necessarily match 
we anticipate borrowing and repaying funds under our credit arrangements throughout the year 
if we start to see a significant change in commodity prices from our current forecasts  we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in our cash flows from operations 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with environmental and safety regulations and requirements 
these costs are considered a normal recurring cost of our ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance 
we do not anticipate that we will be required to expend amounts that will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations  nor are we aware of any pending regulatory changes that would have a material impact our exploration and development drilling program is discussed in more detail in exploration and development activity overview under item of this form k 

table of contents financial condition future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables  such as our success in locating and producing new reserves  the level of production from existing wells and prices of oil and natural gas 
to meet our capital and liquidity requirements  we rely on certain resources  including cash flows from operating activities  access to capital markets  and bank borrowings 
while we attempt to operate within forecasted cash flows from operations  we do periodically access our credit facility to finance our working capital needs and growth 
during our total assets  net oil and gas assets  net income and stockholders equity were reduced by a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in the amount of million million after tax 
total assets decreased in from billion at the beginning of the year to billion by december  our net oil and gas assets decreased by million and our cash position increased by million for the same period 
as of december   stockholders equity totaled billion  down from billion at december  the decrease resulted primarily from a current year net loss of million 
dividends in december  the board of directors declared the company s first quarterly cash dividend of 
per share payable to shareholders 
a dividend has been authorized in every quarter since then 
on december  the board of directors increased the regular cash dividend on our common stock from to per common share 
common stock repurchase program in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to four million shares of common stock 
during we repurchased a total of  shares at an average purchase price of 
cumulative purchases through december  total  shares at an average price of 
no purchases were made in or since the quarter ended september  in the board of directors extended the repurchase program to december  working capital analysis our working capital balance fluctuates primarily as a result of our exploration and development activities and our realized commodity prices 
working capital is also impacted by our current tax provisions  accrued g a and changes in the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments 
at december   we had positive working capital of million  down million from year end working capital decreased primarily because of the following changes related to our current income tax provisions  including receipt of tax refunds  resulted in net decreases of million 
decreases associated with oil and gas well equipment and supplies were million 
an increase of million related to bonus accruals 
a net decrease of million in the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments 
a net decrease of million of various other current assets and liabilities  including a net decrease of million in outstanding advances

the new credit facility increased bank commitments from million to million  with a borrowing base of billion 
the credit facility is provided by a syndicate of banks led by jp morgan chase bank  na  matures on april  and is secured by mortgages on certain of our oil and gas properties and the stock of certain wholly owned operating subsidiaries 
the borrowing base under the credit agreement is determined at the discretion of the lenders  based on the collateral value of our proved reserves  and is subject to potential special and regular semi annual redeterminations 
the credit facility contains covenants and restrictive provisions which may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens 
the credit facility requires us to maintain a current ratio defined to include undrawn borrowings greater than to and a leverage ratio not to exceed to as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial and non financial covenants

at december   there was million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
we also had letters of credit outstanding of million leaving an unused borrowing availability of million 
notes due in may   we issued million of senior unsecured notes that mature may  at par

in may  the fasb issued new guidance that changed the accounting for the components of convertible debt that can be settled wholly or partly in cash upon conversion 
the new requirements were required to be applied to both new instruments and retrospectively to previously issued convertible instruments 
the debt and equity components of the instruments are accounted for separately 
the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated value of similar debt without a conversion feature as of the issuance date  with the remaining proceeds allocated to the equity component and recorded as additional paid in capital 
the debt component is recorded at a discount and is subsequently accreted to its par value  thereby reflecting an overall market rate of interest in the income statement 
the effective interest rate for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
see note for a comparison of certain financial statement line items affected by the retrospective application of this guidance

see item a interest rate risk for more information regarding fixed and variable rate debt 
we have drilling commitments of approximately million consisting of obligations to complete drilling wells in progress at december  we also have minimum expenditure commitments of million to secure the use of drilling rigs 
at december   we have a purchase commitment of million for construction of an aircraft 
the total cost of the aircraft is million with an option to trade in our existing aircraft 
the completion of the aircraft is expected to be no later than october  we have a large development project in sublette county  wyoming where we are developing the deep madison gas formation and constructing a gas processing plant 
at december   we had commitments of million relating to construction of the gas processing plant of which million is subject to a construction contract 
the total cost of the project will approximate million 
pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement with our partners in this project  we will be reimbursed by them for of the costs 
the gas processing plant is subject to a delivery commitment agreement over a year period  commencing december  if no deliveries were made  the maximum amount that would be payable under the agreement would be approximately million 
we have excluded the long term asset retirement obligations because we are not able to precisely predict the timing of these amounts 
other liabilities include the fair value of our liabilities associated with our benefit obligations and other miscellaneous commitments 
at december   we had firm sales contracts to deliver approximately bcf of natural gas over the next three months 
if this gas is not delivered  our financial commitment would be approximately million 
this commitment may fluctuate due to either price volatility or volumes delivered 
however  we do not anticipate that a financial commitment will be due 
in connection with a gas gathering and processing agreement  we have commitments to deliver bcf of gas over the next four years 
if no gas was delivered  the maximum amount that would be payable under these commitments would be approximately million  some of which will be reimbursed by working interest owners who are selling with us under our marketing agreement 

table of contents we have other various delivery commitments in the normal course of business  none of which are individually material 
in aggregate  these commitments have a maximum amount that would be payable  if no gas is delivered  of approximately million  some of which will be reimbursed by working interest owners who are selling with us under our marketing agreements 
all of the noted commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of our business 
based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that the estimated net cash generated from operations  coupled with the cash on hand and amounts available under our existing bank credit facility will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs  including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operations and planned exploration and development activities 
outlook our exploration and development expenditures program for are projected to range from million to million 
though there are a variety of factors that could curtail  delay or even cancel some of our planned operations  we believe our projected program is likely to occur 
the majority of projects are in hand  drilling rigs are being scheduled  and the historical results of our drilling efforts warrant pursuit of the projects 
it is also possible that we may increase our level of planned capital investment if our oil and gas prices exceed our current expectation or if attractive new opportunities arise 
production estimates for range from to mmcfe per day 
revenues from production will be dependent not only on the level of oil and gas actually produced  but also the prices that will be realized 
during  our realized prices averaged per mcf of gas and per barrel of oil 
prices can be very volatile and the possibility of realized prices varying from prices in is high 
certain expenses for on a per mcfe basis are currently estimated as follows production expense transportation expense dd a and asset retirement obligation general and administrative production taxes of oil and gas revenue critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
a complete list of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve significant judgments and discuss the selection and development of these policies and estimates with our audit committee 

table of contents oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
estimations of proved undeveloped reserves can be subject to an even greater possibility of revision 
at year end  percent of our total proved reserves are categorized as proved undeveloped 
of these proved undeveloped reserves  percent are related to a project in wyoming and percent are from the western oklahoma  cana woodford shale play 
our reserve engineers review and revise our reserve estimates regularly as new information becomes available 
additionally  we annually engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our proved reserve estimates associated with at least percent of the discounted future net cash flows before income taxes 
as further discussed in recently issued accounting standards  the sec and fasb amended oil and gas reporting requirements effective december  the impact to cimarex was minimal  apart from the change to a new standard using month average pricing rather than prices in effect at the end of a period 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
for depletion purposes  reserve quantities are adjusted at interim quarterly periods for the estimated impact of additions  dispositions and price changes 
changes in reserve quantities cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision 
it is also possible that a full cost ceiling limitation charge could occur in the period of the revision 
the following table presents information regarding reserve revisions largely resulting from items we do not control  such as revisions due to price  and other revisions resulting from better information due to production history  well performance and changes in production costs 
years ended december  bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves revisions resulting from price changes other changes in estimates total non price related revisions added bcfe over the three year period over the same period we have seen a bcfe decrease resulting from lower prices 
see note  unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures for additional reserve data 
full cost accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities  and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration  and development activities  are also capitalized 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas 
table of contents properties are not recognized in earnings unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to our full cost pool 
at the end of each quarter  we make a full cost ceiling limitation calculation  whereby net capitalized costs related to proved properties less associated deferred income taxes may not exceed the amount of the present value discounted at ten percent of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves less estimated future production and development costs and related income tax expense 
future net revenues used in the calculation of the full cost ceiling limitation have previously been determined based on current oil and gas prices adjusted for designated cash flow hedges 
for year end  new sec rules were implemented requiring reserve calculations to be based on the unweighted average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months 
changes in proved reserve estimates whether based upon quantity revisions or oil and gas prices will cause corresponding changes to the full cost ceiling limitation 
if net capitalized costs subject to amortization exceed this limit  the excess would be charged to expense 
any recorded impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
due to a significant decrease in period end commodity prices  at september   our ceiling limitation calculation resulted in excess capitalized costs of million million  net of tax  for which we recorded a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties 
as a result of further declines in natural gas and oil prices  we recorded additional non cash impairments of oil and gas properties of billion billion after tax in the fourth quarter of  and million million after tax in the first quarter of the company s quarterly and annual ceiling test has been primarily impacted by commodity prices  reserve quantities added and produced  overall exploration and development costs and depletion expense 
holding all factors constant other than commodity prices  a decline in prices as of december  would not have resulted in a ceiling test impairment 
changes in actual reserve quantities added and produced along with our actual overall exploration and development costs will determine the company s actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analyses 
decreases in commodity prices can also impact our goodwill impairment analyses 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations 
goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of the company with the recorded net book value including the goodwill  after giving effect to all other period impairments  including the impairment of oil and gas properties from the full cost pool ceiling limitation calculation 
if the estimated fair value is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required 
if  however  the estimated fair value is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required  if any 
in this second step  a hypothetical acquisition value of the company is computed utilizing purchase business combination accounting rules 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the company for purposes of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
as of december   the market price per share of our common stock was greater than the book value by per share 
due to volatility in the stock markets  management does not consider the market value of our shares to be an accurate reflection of our net assets for impairment purposes 
to estimate the fair value of the company  we use all available information  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets 
this estimated fair value differs significantly from the valuation used in the ceiling limitation calculation which requires that prices and costs be held constant over the life of the wells and are discounted at percent 
the ceiling calculation is not intended to be indicative of fair value 
in estimating the fair value of our oil and gas properties for our goodwill impairment analysis  we used projected future prices based on the nymex strip index at december  adjusted for estimated 
table of contents delivery point price differentials 
as of december   the fair value exceeds the carrying value of our net assets 
should lower prices or quantities result in the future  or higher discount rates be necessary  the carrying value of our net assets may exceed the estimated fair value  resulting in an impairment of goodwill 
contingencies a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment 
in many cases  this judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
we closely monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determine when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us 
in january   the tulsa county district court issued a judgment in the hb krug  et al versus helmerich payne  inc h p case 
this lawsuit was originally filed in and addressed h p s conduct pertaining to a take or pay settlement  along with potential drainage issues and other related matters 
damages of million  plus million for disgorgement of h p s estimated potential compounded profit since resulting from the noted damages  were awarded to plaintiff royalty owners for a total of million 
this amount was subsequently adjusted by the court to a total of million 
pursuant to the spin off transaction to shareholders of h p by which cimarex became a publicly traded entity  cimarex assumed the assets and liabilities of h p s exploration and production business 
in we had accrued litigation expense of million for this lawsuit 
during  we have accrued an additional million 
we have appealed the district court s judgments 
in the normal course of business  we have other various litigation related matters 
we assess the probability of estimable amounts related to litigation matters in accordance with guidance established by the fasb and adjust our accruals accordingly 
for the year  we had approximately million of such expenses 
though some of the related claims may be significant  the resolution of them we believe  individually or in the aggregate  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
for example  as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information  we may revise our estimates of current costs  the assumed annual inflation of these costs and or the assumed productive lives of our wells 
during  we revised our existing estimated asset retirement obligation by million  or approximately nine percent of the asset retirement obligation at december   due to changes in the various related attributes 
over the past three years  revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation averaged approximately percent 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to 
table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the sec adopted revisions to its required oil and gas reporting disclosures 
the revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
in the three decades that have passed since adoption of these disclosure items  there have been significant changes in the oil and gas industry 
the amendments are designed to modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology 
in addition  the amendments concurrently align the sec s full cost accounting rules with the revised disclosures 
the revised disclosure requirements must be incorporated in registration statements filed on or after january   and annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  a company may not apply the new rules to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required 
the following amendments have the greatest likelihood of affecting our reserve disclosures pricing mechanism for oil and gas reserves estimation the sec s prior rules required proved reserve estimates to be calculated using prices as of the end of the period and held constant over the life of the reserves 
price changes can be made only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements 
the revised rules require reserve estimates to be calculated using a month average price 
the month average price will also be used for purposes of calculating the full cost ceiling limitations 
price changes can still be incorporated to the extent defined by contractual arrangements 
the use of a month average price rather than a single day price is expected to reduce the impact on reserve estimates and the full cost ceiling limitations due to short term volatility and seasonality of prices 
reasonable certainty the sec s prior definition of proved oil and gas reserves incorporate certain specific concepts such as lowest known hydrocarbons  which limits the ability to claim proved reserves in the absence of information on fluid contacts in a well penetration  notwithstanding the existence of other engineering and geoscientific evidence 
the revised rules amend the definition to permit the use of reliable technologies to establish the reasonable certainty of proved reserves 
this revision also includes provisions for establishing levels of lowest known hydrocarbons and highest known oil through reliable technology other than well penetrations 
the revised rules also amend the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to include reserves located beyond development spacing areas that are immediately adjacent to developed spacing areas if economic producibility can be established with reasonable certainty 
these revisions are designed to permit the use of alternative technologies to establish proved reserves in lieu of requiring companies to use specific tests 
in addition  they establish a uniform standard of reasonable certainty that applies to all proved reserves  regardless of location or distance from producing wells 
because the revised rules generally expand the definition of proved reserves  proved reserve estimates could increase in the future based upon adoption of the revised rules 
unproved reserves the sec s prior rules prohibited disclosure of reserve estimates other than proved in documents filed with the sec 
the revised rules permit disclosure of probable and possible reserves and provide definitions of probable reserves and possible reserves 
disclosure of probable and possible reserves is optional 
however  such disclosures must meet specific requirements 
disclosures of probable or possible reserves must provide the same level of geographic detail as proved reserves 
probable and possible reserve disclosures must also provide disclosure of the relative uncertainty associated with these classifications of reserves estimations 

table of contents in june  the fasb approved the fasb accounting standards codification asc  which after its launch on july  became the single source of authoritative  nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the codification reorganizes all previous us gaap pronouncements into roughly accounting topics and displays all topics using a consistent structure 
all existing standards that were used to create the codification are now superseded  replacing the previous references to specific statements of financial accounting standards with numbers used in the codification s structural organization 
in january  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  extractive industries oil and gas topic oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure 
this asu amends the fasb accounting standards to align the reserve calculation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the new sec rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting requirements

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
price fluctuations our major market risk is pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
the prices we receive for our production are based on prevailing market conditions and are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control 
pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable 
we periodically hedge a portion of our price risk associated with our future oil and gas production 
the following table details the contracts we have in place as of december  natural gas contracts weighted average price fair value s period type volume day index floor ceiling swap jan dec collar  mmbtu pepl  jan dec swap  mmbtu pepl  jan dec collar  mmbtu hsc oil contracts weighted average price fair value s period type volume day index floor ceiling jan dec collar  bbls wti  jan dec put floor  bbls wti pepl refers to panhandle eastern pipe line company price and hsc refers to houston ship channel price  both as quoted in platt s inside ferc on the first business day of each month 
wti refers to west texas intermediate price as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
while these contracts limit the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
for the contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the price below or above the contracted price applied to the notional amounts would cause a change in our gain loss on mark to market derivatives in of million 

table of contents in spite of the recent turmoil in the financial markets  counterparty credit risk did not have a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and commodity derivative valuations 
this is primarily the result of two factors 
first  we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties 
our commodity derivative contracts are held with eight separate counterparties 
second  our derivative contracts are held with investment grade counterparties that are a part of our credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
interest rate risk at december   our debt was comprised of the following in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt bank debt notes due floating rate convertible notes due face value  total long term debt as of december   the amounts outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at either a a libor plus to percent  based on borrowing base usage  or b the higher of i a prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus percent  or iii adjusted libor  in each case  plus an additional to percent  based on borrowing base usage 
our senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and will mature on may   and our unsecured convertible senior notes bear interest at an annual rate of three month libor  reset quarterly 
we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because approximately of our long term debt obligations were at fixed rates 
an increase of basis points in the three month libor rate would increase our annual interest expense by  this sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments
