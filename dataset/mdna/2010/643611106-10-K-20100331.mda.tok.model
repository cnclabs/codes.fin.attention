item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview effective september   the company completed the acquisition of certain entities  mineral interests and related assets through entities named carl e 
smith  inc  a west virginia corporation  two of its affiliates  carl e 
smith petroleum  inc and carl e 
smith real estate  inc and other privately owned related assets collectively cesi 
immediately after the acquisition  all of the acquired entities and assets were merged into carl e 
smith  inc  the name of which was changed to mountaineer state energy  inc mountaineer which became a wholly owned subsidiary of nce 
the assets acquired include producing gas wells  non producing wells and related equipment  mineral leases covering  acres located in athens and meigs counties in ohio as well as calhoun  jackson a nd roane counties in west virginia 
in addition to the wells and mineral leases  the acquisition included a complex covering approximately acres of land with  square feet of office and storage buildings  an adjacent acre site with a stall horse barn  machinery and equipment in excess of the needs of the gas operation and approximately million in cash 
nce has evaluated the excess equipment and since the acquisition has sold currently plans on selling certain excess land and equipment not needed for current or planned future operations 
the cash portion of the asset acquisition totaling approximately million was paid from existing working capital held by nce 
as part of the acquisition the company entered into certain non interest bearing long term obligations which will paid out over the next years 
the company has evaluated the above notes and after factoring in certain offsets provided for in the agreement has valued the above obligations at  at december  as of december   the company leased one independent living community in oregon  with a capacity of residents 
a number of years ago the company has owned  leased and operated assisted living and retirement communities throughout the united states 
during that period of time the company has both acquired and sold over seventy communities 
the property in oregon is a holdover from that time period 
while not an integral part of our business plan the one remaining facility is profitable and it is anticipated that it will remain a part of the company s operations 
in  the company acquired interests in a significant block of oil and natural gas leases in cleburne county  arkansas covering approximately  net acres 
the company originally intended to drill on the acreage however an opportunity arose to sell the acreage and in we sold those mineral rights for a gain of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of the company s accounting policies require the application of judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments and estimates are based upon the company s historical experience  current trends and information available from other sources that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are more significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
oil and gas property accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies may elect to account for their property costs using either the successful efforts or full cost accounting method 
under the successful efforts method  unsuccessful exploratory well costs  as well as all exploratory geological and geophysical costs  are expensed 
under the full cost method  all exploration costs are capitalized  regardless of success 
selection of the oil and gas accounting method can have a significant impact on a company s financial results 
we use the full cost method of accounting and generally pursue acquisitions and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
once we incur costs  they are recorded in the depletable pool of proved properties or in unprove d properties  collectively  the full cost pool 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we evaluate possible impairment of producing properties when conditions indicate that the properties may be impaired 
such conditions include a significant decline in product prices which we believe to be other than temporary or a significant downward revision in estimated proved reserves for a field or area 
an impairment provision must be recorded to adjust the net book value of the property to its estimated fair value if the net book value exceeds management s estimate of future net cash flows from the property 
the estimated fair value of the property is generally calculated as the discounted present value of future net cash flows 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the latest available proved reserve and production information and management s estimates of future product prices and costs  based on available information such as forward strip prices and industry forecasts and analysis 
the impairment assessment process is primarily dependent upon the estimate of proved reserves 
any overstatement of estimated proved reserve quantities would result in an overstatement of estimated future net cash flows  which could result in an understated assessment of impairment 
the subjectivity and risks associated with estimating proved reserves are discussed under oil and gas reserves below 
prediction of product prices is subjective since prices are largely dependent upon supply and demand resulting from global and national conditions generally beyond our control 
however  management s assessment of product prices for purposes of impairment is consistent with that used in its business plans and investment decisions 
we believe that a sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changes in assumptions on estimated impairment is impracticable to provide because of the number of assumptions and variables involved which have interdependent effects on the potential outcome 
oil and gas reserves our proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof  including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
proved reserves  as defined by the financial accounting standards board and adopted by the securities and exchange commission  are limited to reservoir areas that indicate economic producibility through actual production or conclusive formation tests  and generally cannot extend beyond the immediately adjoining undrilled portion 
although improved technology often can identify possible or probable reserves other than by drilling  under current sec rules  these reserves cannot be estimated and disclosed 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
while total dd a expense for the life of a property is limited to the property s total cost  proved reserve revisions result in a change in timing of when dd a expense is recognized 
downward revisions of proved reserves result in an acceleration of dd a expense  while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of dd a expense recognition 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows are prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable is based on an analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts 
management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant  customer or other debtor and the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor 
management s estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change 
deferred tax assets significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the future recoverability of the company s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carry forwards 
at december   the company had a deferred tax asset due to tax deductions available to it in future years 
however  as management could not determine that it was more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset would be realized  a valuation allowance was established 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december  and  at december  new concept s principal sources of cash are property operations  sales of oil and gas  and proceeds from sales of assets 
at december  the company had million invested in short term notes receivable with interest at the prime rate plus two percent 
net cash provided by used in continuing operating activities was  in   in  and  in net cash provided by used in investing activities was  in  million in   in net cash provided by used in financing activities was  in  million in  and in the million used in was the result of the payment of related party debt of million  partially offset by receipt of million for the issuance of  shares of common stock 
there were no discontinued operations in or net cash provided used in discontinued operations was  in results of operations fiscal as compared to revenues and operating expenses total revenues for totaled million compared to million in the primary reason for the increase is the acquisition of the oil and gas operations in september fiscal reflects a full twelve months of operating revenue for the oil and gas operations  while reflects only four months of such revenue 
oil and gas revenue did not increase as much as may have been anticipated due to the expiration of a fixed price contract in the first quarter of for the remainder of the year  gas was sold at the spot price  which was substantially less than the original contract price 
revenue for the retirement facility totaled approximately million for and operating expenses totaled million for compared to million for in  oil and gas operating costs totaled million compared to  in due to the acquisition of the oil and gas operations described above 
in  the company recorded a non cash charge to operations of million for impairment of natural gas and oil properties  pursuant to the results of the full cost ceiling test 
also in  the company recorded accretion of discount related to its asset retirement obligation of  real estate operating expenses remained relatively constant 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased from  to million  due primarily to the write down of receivables of approximately  and the accrual of  in int erest and penalties on unpaid taxes  offset by reductions in salaries and wages of approximately  interest income interest income decreased approximately  from to due to the reduction interest rate on portions of the notes receivable from eight percent to the prime rate plus two percent during interest expense interest expense for decreased approximately  due to the pay off of million of related party debt in the first quarter of gain on sale of assets in  the company sold its investment in mineral rights in the fayetteville shale for a gain of approximately million 
no gain or loss was recorded on sales of assets in other income other income decreased from  in to  in other income in is primarily due to cash received from receivables that were previously fully reserved 
fiscal as compared to revenues and operating expenses revenues for totaled million compared to million in the primary reason for the increase is the acquisition of the oil and gas operations in west virginia and ohio in september   which provided  of net revenue 
revenue for the retirement facility totaled approximately million in as compared to million for operating expenses totaled million for compared to million for in  oil and gas operating costs totaled  and corporate general and administrative expenses increased approximately  primarily due to the administrative costs of the acquisition 
interest income interest income increased approximately  from to due to the increase in the interest bearing loans to affiliates during interest expense interest expense for increased approximately  due primarily to the amount of time debt was owed 
interest on the note payable to affiliate in reflects less than two months of accrued interest  while interest is for more than four months 
gain on sale of assets in  the company sold its investment in mineral rights in the fayetteville shale for a gain of approximately million 
in  the company sold a participation in the future cash flow of its retirement community in king city  oregon and recorded a gain of  other income other income increased from  in to  in the increase in is primarily due to cash received from receivables that were previously fully reserved 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of the company s debt is financed at fixed rates of interest 
therefore  the company has minimal risk from exposure to changes in interest rates
