executive overview executive summary in  with the continuing impact of an economic slowdown  management has continued to focus on managing credit quality  building liquidity sources  managing capital  and improving operational earnings of the company 
as always  we continue our on going efforts of meeting the financial services needs of our customers and communities  especially in this challenging economic environment 
managing credit quality senior management continues to work closely with credit administration and our lending staff to insure that adequate resources are in place to proactively manage through the current slowdown in the real estate markets and overall economy 
when problems are identified  management remains diligent in assessing the situation  moving quickly to minimize losses  while being sensitive to the borrower s effectiveness as an operator  the long term viability of the business or project  and the borrower s commitment to working with the bank to achieve an acceptable resolution of the credit 
if the economic slowdown continues  we will most likely continue to experience a rise in non performing assets as we address each situation on a case by case basis 
when faced with possible loss situations  management may determine it is in the shareholders best long term interest to work with the borrower or oversee a viable project through to completion 
we anticipate that a prolonged economic slowdown will place significant pressure on the consumers and businesses in north carolina 
through our builder participation program we have been able to move out of jumbo homes and out of conforming homes out of our builder construction portfolio either to permanent mortgages placed with other lenders or permanent mortgages financed by the bank to qualified borrowers 
the program has resulted in the reduction of our exposure to jumbo homes from million to million  and the reduction of our exposure to conventional homes from million to million 
we have also extended this program to cover the residential lot inventory of our development borrowers

building liquidity sources management has continued to focus on providing additional liquidity sources  both on balance sheet and off 
during the year ended december   we reduced our borrowings with the fhlb from million to million by increasing noninterest and interest bearing deposits by approximately million 
the reduction in borrowings with the fhlb has provided us with additional availability to meet unforeseen liquidity demands that may arise 
we currently have securities with a market value of million pledged to the fhlb  and have unpledged securities held in safekeeping at the fhlb with a market value of million that could be pledged or sold if needed 
the bank also has unused federal funds purchased lines totaling million with two correspondent banks 
in addition  management has plans to continue to build off balance sheet sources of liquidity 
in the fourth quarter of  the bank explored pledging qualifying commercial loans as collateral through the federal reserve discount window 
management decided not to explore this alternative but in the second half of intends to explore leveraging our existing relationship with the fhlb by pledging certain commercial loans as collateral for borrowings 
managing capital the company was able to bolster its capital levels through its million participation in the cpp on january  of the total million cpp funds received  to date million of the cpp funds have been contributed to the bank as additional equity capital 
the remaining funds  approximately million  are retained by the company but could be pushed down to the bank if needed 
with total risk based capital levels at the bank of and at december  and december   respectively  the bank is above the minimum requirement to be classified as well capitalized 
if the remaining million of available capital at the company were contributed to the bank as additional equity capital  the bank s total risk based capital ratio would be at december  and would place it well above the minimum well capitalized requirement of 
despite healthy capital levels  due to significant uncertainty surrounding the depth or the length of the current economic slowdown  management continues to be diligent in its efforts to maintain healthy levels of excess capital above minimum requirements  and has had presentations with four different firms to discuss potential options for raising capital in the future 
improving operational earnings pretax  pre loan loss provision  post cpp dividend payment  earnings were million for  compared to million for  an increase of approximately thousand 
years ended december  dollars in thousands income before income taxes add provision for loan losses subtract preferred stock dividends pretax  pre loan loss provision  post cpp dividend payment earnings during the fourth quarter of  in anticipation of receiving the cpp funds  management began implementing a strategy to invest unutilized capital at the holding company level from oak ridge s trust preferred issuance in private label mortgage backed and government agency securities  well before mortgage rates in this sector began to decline due to aggressive purchases by the federal reserve  the us treasury  and other community banks seeking to leverage their new cpp funds 
that strategy resulted in the company purchasing million in private label mortgage backed securities and government agency securities in the fourth quarter of  and an additional million of small business investment company sbic debentures  small business administration sba debentures and private label mortgage backed securities during the first six months of although one private label security was determined to be impaired by management and resulted in a  write down during the year ended december   the investment purchase strategy by management has resulted in an effective deployment of part of the cpp funds  and has positively offset the company s cpp dividends and loan loss provisions in our core strategies continue to be grow the loan portfolio while maintaining high asset quality  increase noninterest income  grow core deposits  manage expenses  and make strategic investments in personnel and technology to increase revenue and increase efficiency 
challenges the company has grown steadily since the opening of the bank in april of  and its business has become more dynamic and complex in recent years as the bank has enhanced or added delivery channels  products and services  and lines of businesses 
while the achievement of the company s strategic initiatives and established long term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges  management has identified the challenges that are most relevant and most likely to have a near term effect on operations  which are presented below continuing to maintain our asset quality  especially in an uncertain and weak economic environment  addressing the challenges associated with a weakening economic environment in its geographic market  improving efficiency and controlling noninterest expenses  maintaining its net interest margin in the current interest rate environment  increasing core deposits  increasing interest and noninterest revenue  controlling costs associated with the current heightened regulatory environment  volatility in the mortgage banking business  competition from bank and nonbank financial service providers  and intense price competition 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december   and net income in  our income available to common stockholders was thousand or basic and diluted earnings per share  compared to income available to common stockholders of million or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the decrease in earnings is primarily due to an increase in provision for loan loss expense and noninterest expense  offset by an increase in net interest income 
the following table shows return on assets net income divided by average assets  return on equity net income divided by average shareholders equity and shareholders equity to assets ratio average shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years presented 
year ended december  return on assets return on equity shareholders equity to assets net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets  such as loans and investment securities and the interest paid on liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings is our primary source of operating income 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balances volume of interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  increases or decreases in the average interest rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities  the ability to manage the interest earning asset portfolio  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as non interest bearing deposits 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure profitability of net interest income net interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread does not consider the impact of non interest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percentage of total average earning assets and takes into account the positive effects of investing non interest bearing deposits in earning assets 
our net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or when compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  our net interest margin for was compared to for the increase in our net interest margin is mainly the result of decreased rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities and an increase in yields on our taxable investments  offset by a decline in yields on our loans receivable 
our net interest rate spread  on a tax equivalent basis  for was compared to for the spread increased by basis points as the decrease in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities was basis points more than the change in yields earned on interest earning assets for the year 
total interest income increased million or to million in compared to million in interest income in increases in our average earning assets of million in when compared to resulted in a million increase in interest income from to but this was partially offset by a decrease in interest income of million from a decline in yields 
we funded the increases in interest earning assets primarily with interest bearing checking  savings  and money market deposit growth 
the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points during the effect of variances in volume and rate on interest income and interest expense is illustrated in the table titled change in interest income and expense 
we attribute the decrease in the yield on our earning assets to the drop in short term market interest rates 
during  the federal open market committee fomc decreased short term rates to basis points from to a range of to 
approximately million or of our loan portfolio consists of variable rate loans that adjust with the movement of the prime rate 
as a result  composite yield on our loans decreased approximately basis points for the year ended december  compared to december  similarly  our average cost of funds for was  a decrease of basis points when compared to for the average cost on interest bearing deposit accounts decreased basis points from paid in to paid in  while our average cost of borrowed funds decreased basis points during compared to total interest expense decreased million or to million in from million in  primarily the result of decreased market rates paid on bank certificates of deposit 
the volume of average interest bearing liabilities increased approximately million when comparing with that of the decrease to interest expense resulting from decreased rates on all interest bearing liabilities was million and the increase attributable to higher volumes of interest bearing liabilities was million 
our net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or when compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  our net interest margin for was compared to for the decreased net interest margin resulted from increased competitive pricing for money market accounts and certificates of deposits 
our net interest rate spread for was compared to for as a result of interest rate cuts by the federal reserve loan rates decreased more than rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the spread decreased by basis points as the change in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities was basis points less than the change in yields earned on interest earning assets for the year 
total interest income increased million or to million in compared to million in interest income in increases in our average earning assets of million in when compared to resulted in million increase in interest income from to but this was offset by a decrease in interest income of million from a decline in yields 
we funded the increases in interest earning assets primarily with certificates of deposit and federal home loan bank advances 
the tax equivalent yield on average earning assets decreased basis points during similarly  our average cost of funds for was  a decrease of basis points when compared to for the average cost on interest bearing deposits decreased basis points from paid in to paid in  while our average cost of borrowed funds decreased basis points during compared to total interest expense increased thousand or to million in from million in  primarily the result of decreased market rates paid on bank certificates of deposit 
the volume of average interest bearing liabilities increased approximately million when comparing with that of the decrease to interest expense resulting from decreased rates on all interest bearing liabilities was million and the increase attributable to higher volumes of interest bearing liabilities was million

the following table sets forth our interest sensitivity analysis at december  and describes  at various cumulative maturity intervals  the gap ratios ratios of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities for assets and liabilities that we consider to be rate sensitive 
the interest sensitivity position has meaning only as of the date for which it was prepared 
variable rate loans are considered to be highly sensitive to rate changes and are assumed to reprice within months 
the difference between interest sensitive asset and interest sensitive liability repricing within time periods is referred to as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
gaps are identified as either positive interest sensitive assets in excess of interest sensitive liabilities or negative interest sensitive liabilities in excess of interest sensitive assets 
as of december   we had a negative one year cumulative gap of 
we have interest earning assets of million maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities of million repricing or maturing within one year 
this is primarily the result of short term interest sensitive liabilities being used to fund longer term interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities 
a negative gap position implies that interest bearing liabilities deposits and other borrowings will reprice at a faster rate than interest earning assets loans and investments 
in a falling rate environment  a negative gap position will generally have a positive effect on earnings  while in a rising rate environment this will generally have a negative effect on earnings 
on december   our savings and time deposits of million included savings  now and money market accounts of million 
in our rate sensitivity analysis  these deposits are considered as repricing in the earliest period months or less because the rate we pay on these interest bearing deposits can be changed weekly 
however  our historical experience has shown that changes in market interest rates have little  if any  effect on those deposits within a given time period and  for that reason  those liabilities could be considered non rate sensitive 
if those deposits were excluded from rate sensitive liabilities  our rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be more closely matched at the end of the one year period

income simulation analysis captures not only the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
income simulation also attends to the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items  and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
finally  income simulation permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates  but also of proposed strategies for responding to them 
the company s income simulation model was developed by profitstar  a financial services consulting firm that provides asset liability management solutions  product pricing solutions and other products and services to banks  thrifts  and credit unions nationwide 
the model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income and net income over the next months in a flat rate scenario versus net interest income and net income in alternative interest rate scenarios 
management continually reviews and refines its interest rate risk management process in response to the changing economic climate 
the company s alco asset liability committee policy has established that interest income sensitivity will be considered acceptable if net interest income does not decline from the flat rate scenario more than   and in the plus and minus  and basis point scenarios  respectively 
these interest rate scenarios assume that rates increase immediately and permanently 
at december   the company s income simulation model projects that net interest income would increase  and percent in the plus  and basis point change scenarios 
all of these forecasts are within an acceptable level of interest rate risk per the policies established by alco 
alco did not consider the minus  and basis point change scenarios relevant at december  due to the current low rate environment 
in the event the model indicates an unacceptable level of risk  management could undertake a number of actions that would reduce this risk  including the sale of a portion of the company s available for sale investment portfolio  the use of risk management strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps  or the extension of the maturities of its short term borrowings 
noninterest income noninterest income  principally charges and fees assessed for the use of our services  is a significant contributor to net income

mortgage loan origination fees were up by thousand or due to low mortgage rates and more mortgage originators at the bank in as compared to investment and insurance commissions were down by thousand or 
a large part of the decrease in this category was due to a decline in fees tied to the market value of assets under management due to lower market prices in on most investments 
fee income from accounts receivable was down by thousand or due to lower client receivable balances in compared to due to the weak economic conditions 
debit card interchange income was up by thousand or due to a high number of debit cards and increased transactions due to the shift to higher debit over credit card usage 
income earned on bank owned life insurance was up by thousand or due to higher rates in on the underlying life insurance policies 
other service changes and fees were relatively unchanged from to in noninterest income increased thousand or to million compared to million for the same period in service charges on deposits  which represent a relatively stable and predictable source of noninterest income  were up by thousand or 
mortgage loan origination fees were down by thousand or  due to the poor economic environment in compared to the bank s investment services group  which services its banking offices  and the oak ridge wealth management division  which was formed in and operates independently of the bank  comprise all of the investment and insurance commissions noninterest category 
these two divisions were merged into one business unit in  with no material impact on the bank 
investment and insurance commissions were down by thousand or largely due to a decline in the value of assets under management for both the investment services group and the oak ridge wealth management business units 
revenue in both these areas is positively correlated with the underlying value of assets under management 
fee income from accounts receivable financing was up by thousand or largely due to the addition of new customers in debit card interchange income was up by thousand or

employee benefits increased thousand or in over the prior year principally due to an increase in employee group insurance as a result of employee additions in  offset by a decrease in supplemental executive retirement plan expense 
as of december   we had the equivalent of full time employees and operated full service banking offices and an office housing our independent wealth management division 
occupancy expense increased thousand or in mainly due to maintenance expense increasing thousand and depreciation expense increasing thousand 
the increased maintenance expenses in were due to the increased number and age of facilities to maintain 
the increase in occupancy expense is primarily due to the completion and occupancy in july of of the company s  square foot corporate headquarters and support facility 
equipment expense increased thousand or in mainly due to depreciation expense increasing thousand  with this increase offset by decreases in other equipment expense accounts 
the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to the addition of furniture and computer hardware and software associated with the company s corporate headquarters and support facility 
data and items processing expense increased thousand or in mainly due to an increasing investment in products and services as well as an increase in the number of customers and accounts 
some of the increase was due to items being expensed in this area that were previously expensed in professional and advertising expenses 
professional and advertising expenses  which include audit  legal  consulting and marketing and advertising fees  increased thousand or to million for compared to million in legal fees increased thousand year over year due to increased servicing of delinquent loans as well as increased legal advice on company matters 
audit fees increased thousand during as compared to due to an increase in the company s internal audit coverage as well as various fees associated with other consultations 
consulting fees increased thousand in compared to due to the use of outside expertise for such matters as investment securities valuation and loan portfolio stress analyses 
other outside services decreased by thousand in compared to  partly due to a decreasing reliance in on a computer services vendor  as well as items being expensed in data and items processing that were previously expensed to professional and advertising expenses 
stationary and supplies expense decreased thousand in compared to same period of primarily the result of decreases in supply usage at our banking offices and support areas

telecommunication expenses  which include voice and data communications  decreased thousand or to thousand for compared to thousand in fdic insurance increased thousand in due to increased assessment rates and an increase in our deposit balances 
also  thousand of the increase is related to the special assessment that was levied on all banks by the fdic 
accounts receivable financing expense decreased thousand or to thousand for compared to thousand in expenses in this line of business were positively impacted by lower client receivable balances in compared to due to the weak economic conditions 
other expenses increased thousand or to million for compared to thousand in increases in this area are attributable to increased emphasis on training and education as well as increased loan servicing costs 
noninterest expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year period 
the million or percent increase reflects the continuing efforts to expand the company s infrastructure and branch network 
of the million total increase  thousand was in salaries and employee benefits  which are the areas most impacted by the branch network and infrastructure improvements 
salary expense increased thousand or in compared to the increase is the result of employee additions in the production and support areas of the bank as well as general cost of living and merit increases 
employee benefits increased thousand or in over the prior year due to employee additions 
occupancy expense increased thousand or in equipment expense increased thousand or in compared to the increases in occupancy expense and equipment expense were due to the fifth banking office which opened in january data and items processing expense increased thousand or in due to the renewal of the contract with our core system vendor in march as well as continued growth

the mix of average earning assets changed from december  to december   with loans declining from of total assets in to in  and investment securities increasing from of total assets in to in the shift in earning assets to investments from loans was a conscious strategy in and by management to try to invest excess funds in investment securities rather than loans 
during the latter part of management stopped purchasing investment securities due to our perception that the us treasury s plan to purchase up to trillion in securities would increase overall market security prices and lower yields

while management has consciously focused on decreasing its concentration to construction and development loans  it is honoring any commitments to existing credit worthy borrowers 
the decline in construction and development loans does not take into account the advances from january  to december  on unfunded or partially funded family residential construction loans 
residential  family loans increased from million in to million in the increase in this segment is due to two reasons 
first  in august of  the bank s primary correspondent lender for residential loans failed  and the bank stepped in to finance residential mortgages that were committed but not funded by this lender 
second  in  the bank developed its builder participation program  where it provided financing to credit worthy borrowers that wanted to purchase family residential homes out of the bank s builder construction portfolio 
the bank s portfolios of loans secured by farmland  residential  or more families  nonfarm  nonresidential and consumer loans remained relatively unchanged from to commercial and industrial loans decreased from million in to million in the decline was due to fewer opportunities in this segment as a result of the overall weak economic environment that was present in and at december   our loan portfolio contained no foreign loans  and we believe the portfolio is adequately diversified 
real estate loans represent approximately of our loan portfolio 
real estate loans are primarily loans secured by real estate  including mortgage and construction loans 
residential mortgage loans accounted for approximately million or of our real estate loans at december  commercial loans are spread throughout a variety of industries  with no particular industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio 
at december   our ten largest loans accounted for approximately of our loans outstanding 
as of december   we had outstanding loan commitments of approximately million 
the amounts of loans outstanding at the indicated dates are shown in the following table according to loan type

approximately of our loan portfolio is comprised of variable rate loans 
commercial and industrial construction and development others total amount dollars in thousands three months or less over months to months over year to years over years total loans allowance for loan losses we consider the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover estimated probable loan losses relating to the loans outstanding as of each reporting period 
the procedures and methods used in the determination of the allowance necessarily rely upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting our loans 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
those agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about the information available to them at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
the following table summarizes the balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  changes in the allowance arising from charge offs and recoveries by category and additions to the allowance that have been charged to expense 
analysis of the allowance for loan losses at december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses at beginning of year charge offs real estate mortgage home equity lines of credit commercial and industrial loans to individuals total charge offs recoveries real estate mortgage home equity lines of credit commercial and industrial loans to individuals total recoveries net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses charged to operations balance at end of period total loans outstanding at year end average net loans outstanding for the year ratio of net loan charge offs to average loans outstanding ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at period end at december   our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was  up from at december  the increase in part reflects the increase in our historical loss rate as our charge offs have increased during the past year 
also  the increase reflects the recognition of additional loans identified as being impaired 
in evaluating the allowance for loan losses  we prepare an analysis of our current loan portfolio through the use of historical loss rates  homogeneous risk analysis grouping to include probabilities for loss in each group by risk grade  estimation of years to impairment in each homogeneous grouping  analysis of internal credit processes  and past due loan portfolio performance and overall economic conditions  both regionally and nationally 
historical loss calculations for each homogeneous risk group are based on a weighted average loss ratio calculation 
the most previous quarter s loss history is used in the loss history and is adjusted to reflect current losses in the homogeneous risk groups 
current losses translate into a higher loss ratio which is further increased by the associated risk grades within the group 
the impact is to more quickly recognize and increase the loss history in a respective grouping  resulting in an increase in the allowance for that particular homogeneous group 
for those groups with little or no loss history  management bases the historical factor based on current economic conditions and their potential impact on that particular loan group 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on either the fair value of the underlying collateral  the present value of the future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  or the estimated market value of the loan 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses a comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets  which is consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
while we believe that our management uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments to the allowance for loan losses  and net income could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination 
because these factors and management s assumptions are subject to change  the allocation is not necessarily indicative of future loan portfolio performance 
loans are charged off against the bank s allowance for loan losses as soon as the loan becomes uncollectible 
unsecured loans are considered uncollectible when no regularly scheduled monthly payment has been made within three months  the loan matured over days ago and has not been renewed or extended or the borrower files for bankruptcy 
secured loans are considered uncollectible when the liquidation of collateral is deemed to be the most likely source of repayment 
once secured loans reach days past due  they are placed into non accrual status unless the loan is considered to be well secured and in process of collection 
if the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent  the principal balance is either written down immediately or reserved as a write down in the bank s allowance model to reflect the current market valuation based on an independent appraisal which may be adjusted by management based on more recent market conditions 
included in the write down is the estimated expense to liquidate the property and typically an additional allowance for the foreclosure discount 
generally  if the loan is unsecured the loan must be charged off in full while if it is secured the loan is charged down to the net liquidation value of the collateral 
net charge offs of million in increased million and million when compared to and  respectively 
net charge offs from real estate secured loans were thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
there were no net charge offs from real estate secured loans in net charge offs from commercial and industrial loans were thousand  thousand and thousand for  and  respectively 
asset quality remains a top priority of the bank 
for the year ending december   net loan charge offs were of average loans compared to for the year ending december  the ratio of annualized net charge offs to average loans increased mainly due to the bank writing down several large collateral dependent loans and completely charging off other loans deemed to be uncollectible 
declining economic conditions resulted in an increased number of impaired collateral dependant loans which resulted in a portion of these loans being charged off 
the increase in the allowance for loan losses to loans to at december  from at december  reflects the increase in our historical loss rate as our charge offs have increased during the past year 
also  the increase reflects the recognition of additional loans identified as being impaired which require specific reserves 
the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans decreased to as of december  compared to at december  the increase is the result of our allowance increasing approximately year over year and our nonperforming loans increasing approximately year over year 
allocation of allowance for loan loss at december  amount amount amount amount amount dollars in thousands residential first liens construction and development family junior liens all other real estate secured total real estate loans commercial and industrial consumer unallocated total represents total of all outstanding loans in each category as a percent of total loans outstanding 
management realizes that general economic trends greatly affect loan losses and no assurances can be made about future losses 
management  however  does consider the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at december  loans considered impaired we review our nonperforming loans and other groups of loans based on loan size or other factors for impairment 
at december   we had loans totaling million which includes million in nonperforming loans which were considered to be impaired compared to million at december  loans are considered impaired if  based on current information  circumstances or events  it is probable that the bank will not collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
however  treating a loan as impaired does not necessarily mean that we expect to incur a loss on that loan  and our impaired loans may include loans that currently are performing in accordance with their terms 
for example  if we believe it is probable that a loan will be collected  but not according to its original agreed upon payment schedule  we may treat that loan as impaired even though we expect that the loan will be repaid or collected in full 
as indicated in the table below  when we believe a loss is probable on a non collateral dependent impaired loan  a portion of our reserve is allocated to that probable loss 
if the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent  the principal balance is written down immediately  or a portion of our reserve is allocated to that probable loss  to reflect the current market valuation based on a current independent appraisal 
the following table sets forth the number and volume of loans net of previous charge offs considered impaired and their associated reserve allocation  if any  at december  analysis of loans considered impaired number of loans loan balances outstanding allocated reserves dollars in thousand non accrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans other impaired loans with allocated reserves impaired loans without allocated reserves total impaired loans the following table summarizes our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated

interest receivable that has been accrued and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectability is charged to the appropriate interest income account 
interest on loans that are classified as non accrual is recognized when received 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original terms 
at december  and  nonperforming assets were approximately and  respectively  of the loans outstanding at such dates 
the general downturn in the overall economy has contributed to the overall increase in nonperforming assets reflected at year end 
the impact of our impaired loans at december   on our interest income was approximately million as we would have accrued million in interest income versus the thousand recognized 
any loans that are classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard or special mention  and that are not included as non performing loans  do not i represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  or ii represent material credits about which management has any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
investment portfolio the composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
our securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for investing available funds  furnishing liquidity and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowed funds 
we use two categories to classify our securities held to maturity and available for sale 
while we have no plans to liquidate a significant amount of our securities  the securities classified as available for sale may be sold to meet liquidity needs should management deem it to be in our best interest 
our available for sale investment securities totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december  our held to maturity investment securities totaled million at december  and million at december  we owned no held to maturity securities as of december  during and the beginning of management executed a strategy to purchase investment securities to take advantage of favorable spreads between yields on securities and our available sources of borrowing 
additions to the investment securities portfolio depend to a large extent on the availability of investable funds that are not otherwise needed to satisfy loan demand 
investable funds not otherwise utilized are temporarily invested as federal funds sold or as interest bearing balances at other banks  the level of which is affected by such considerations as near term loan demand and liquidity needs 
subinvestment grade available for sale and held to maturity private label mortgage backed securities are analyzed on a quarterly basis for impairment by utilizing an independent third party that performs an analysis of the estimated principal the bank is expected to collect on these securities

the bank s obligations under the guarantee are unsecured and subordinate to the senior and subordinated indebtedness of the bank 
the trust preferred securities presently qualify as tier regulatory capital and are reported in federal reserve regulatory reports as a minority consolidated interest in a consolidated subsidiary 
the junior subordinated debentures do not qualify as tier regulatory capital 
on march   the federal reserve board issued a final rule stating that trust preferred securities will continue to be included in tier capital  subject to stricter quantitative and qualitative standards

all our debt securities are of investment grade quality and  if the need arises  can promptly be liquidated on the open market or pledged as collateral for short term borrowing 
consistent with our general approach to liquidity management  loans and other assets of the bank are funded primarily using a core of local deposits  proceeds from retail repurchase agreements and excess bank capital 
during the bank relied more heavily on wholesale time deposits to meet our liquidity needs 
wholesale deposits increased million from december  to december  primarily because of increased use of internet deposits and the use of a wholesale time deposit placement network 
the bank intends to focus on increasing core deposits in order to decrease the amount of wholesale time deposits 
we are a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta

at december   we owned  shares of the fhlb s par value capital stock  compared to  and  shares at december  and  respectively 
no ready market exists for fhlb stock  which is carried at cost 
we also had unsecured federal funds lines in the aggregate amount of million available to us at december  under which we can borrow funds to meet short term liquidity needs 
at december   we did not have any advances under these federal funds lines 
another source of funding available is loan participations sold to other commercial banks in which we retain the servicing rights 
as of december   we had thousand in loan participations sold 
we believe that our liquidity sources are adequate to meet our operating needs

the bank is subject to minimum capital requirements 
as the following table indicates  at december   all capital ratios place the bank in excess of the minimum necessary to be considered well capitalized under bank regulatory guidelines 
at december  actual ratio minimum requirement well capitalized requirement total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio inflation and other issues because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  the effect of inflation on our assets is less significant compared to most commercial and industrial companies 
however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also has a significant effect on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
notwithstanding these effects of inflation  management believes our financial results are influenced more by our ability to react to changes in interest rates than by inflation 
except as discussed in this management s discussion and analysis  management is not aware of trends  events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations 
management is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities which  if they were implemented  would have such an effect
