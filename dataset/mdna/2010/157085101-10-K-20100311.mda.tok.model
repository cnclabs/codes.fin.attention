intercept blood system for plasma the intercept blood system for plasma  or plasma system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated plasma for transfusion 
the plasma system has received ce mark approval in europe and is marketed and sold in several countries in europe and in russia 
france  switzerland  germany  and austria require separate approvals for use of intercept treated plasma products 
such approvals have been obtained in france 
in germany and austria  such approvals will need to be obtained before intercept plasma can be sold on a commercial basis 
many countries outside europe accept the ce mark  and have varying additional administrative or regulatory processes before the plasma system can be made commercially available 
in general  these processes do not require additional clinical trials 
in addition to regulatory approvals  some potential customers desire to conduct their own clinical studies before adopting the plasma system 
in the united states  we will not be able to market the plasma system until we have submitted a product marketing applications based upon our completed phase iii clinical trials 
we do not know if the fda will require any additional studies 
we do not plan to prioritize regulatory approval for the plasma system in the near term 
information regarding our revenues from the plasma system for the years ended december    and can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and item a consolidated financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
intercept blood system for red blood cells the intercept blood system for red blood cells  or red blood cell system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated red blood cells for transfusion 
in september  we terminated the phase iii clinical trials of the red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to intercept treated red 
table of contents blood cells in one patient in the chronic arm of the trial 
however  there were no adverse events associated with intercept treated red blood cells evident in this trial 
the antibody cleared and the patient had no adverse health consequences 
after unblinding the data from the phase iii clinical trial  we found that we had met the primary end point in the acute arm of the clinical trial 
we evaluated the antibodies detected in the clinical trial and have developed process changes designed to diminish the likelihood of antibody reactivity in red blood cells treated with our modified process 
in  we completed a series of in vitro and in vivo tests with further modifications to the red blood cell system 
we completed a phase i clinical trial of the modified process in the first quarter of  meeting the trial s primary end point 
subject to the availability of adequate funding from partners  government grants  and or capital markets  we expect that a minimum of one year is needed to develop and implement commercial product and system design changes to the original red blood cell system before we can enter phase iii clinical trials 
we may be unable to continue commercial product and system design efforts and required phase iii clinical trials  unless we obtain third party funding for such efforts 
intercept blood system technology each of the platelet system and plasma system employ the same technology 
platelet components or plasma components collected from blood donors are transferred into plastic intercept disposable kits in which they are mixed with a proprietary cerus compound  amotosalen  which has an affinity for nucleic acid 
the disposable kits are then placed in an illumination device  or illuminator  where the mixture is exposed to ultra violet a uva light 
if pathogens such as viruses  bacteria or parasites are present in the platelet or plasma components  the energy from the uva light causes the amotosalen to bond with the nucleic acid of the pathogens 
the ability of amotosalen to form both cross links between strands of nucleic acid and links to single nucleic acid strands results in a strong chemical bond between the amotosalen and the nucleic acid of the pathogens 
the presence of these bonds is designed to prevent replication of the nucleic acid within pathogens  effectively inactivating the pathogens 
a high level of inactivation has been demonstrated in a broad range of pathogens studied by cerus and others in laboratory testing 
for instance  intercept has demonstrated inactivation of a number of single stranded nucleic acid based viruses such as hiv  hepatitis b  hepatitis c using a model virus  west nile  chikungunya  and certain influenza viruses 
since platelets and plasma do not rely on nucleic acid for therapeutic efficacy  the intercept blood system is designed to preserve the therapeutic function of the platelet and plasma components when used in human transfusions 
following the inactivation process  any residual amotosalen and by products are reduced by more than through use of a compound adsorption device  which is part of the disposable kit 
we have performed extensive toxicology testing on the residual amotosalen and its by products and good safety margins have been demonstrated 
any remaining amotosalen which may be transfused is rapidly excreted by humans 
leukocytes  also known as white blood cells  are typically present in platelet and plasma components collected for transfusion  and can cause adverse transfusion reactions as well as an often fatal disease called graft versus host disease 
leukocytes  like pathogens  rely on nucleic acid for replication and cellular function 
the intercept blood system  with its combination of the amotosalen and uva light  is designed to inactivate leukocytes in the same manner it inactivates pathogens 
like the platelet system and plasma system  the red blood cell system acts by using a compound to form bonds with nucleic acid in pathogens that may be present in red blood cell components destined for transfusion 
the red blood cell system is designed to preserve the therapeutic qualities of the red blood cells  which do not rely on nucleic acid for their cellular function 
the red blood cell system uses a proprietary cerus compound called s unlike the platelet and plasma systems  the chemical bonds from s are not triggered by uva 
table of contents light  but instead by the ph level of the red blood cell components 
after mixture with the red blood cell components in plastic disposable kits  s is designed to rapidly break down into a form that is no longer chemically reactive with nucleic acid 
as with the platelet and plasma systems  a high level of inactivation in a broad range of pathogens has been demonstrated with the red blood cell system 
by treating blood components with intercept within a day of collection  the inactivation of bacteria prevents bacterial growth that could create increased risk of inflammatory response or dangerous levels of endotoxins 
extensive clinical testing has been done on platelet and plasma products treated with the intercept blood system  as well as haemovigilance studies of the treated blood products in routine use 
we believe that  due to their mechanisms of action  the platelet system  plasma system and red blood cell system will potentially inactivate blood borne pathogens that we have not yet been tested with our systems  including emerging and future threats to the blood supply 
we do not claim  however  that our system will inactivate all pathogens  including prions  and our inactivation claims are limited to those contained in our product specifications 
collaborations baxter we collaborated with baxter on the development and commercialization of the intercept blood system commencing in we obtained worldwide commercialization rights to the red blood cell system from baxter in february effective february   we entered into a restructuring of our agreements with baxter pursuant to which we obtained exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to the platelet and plasma systems  excluding certain asian countries where the commercialization rights had been licensed to bioone 
we agreed to pay baxter royalties on future intercept blood system product sales at royalty rates that vary by product of product sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system  for the red blood cell system  and on sales of uva illuminators 
in march  baxter sold its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to a new company  fenwal  inc  or fenwal 
fenwal has assumed baxter s rights and obligations under our agreements 
bioone in june  we and baxter entered into a definitive agreement with bioone for commercialization of our platelet system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone is responsible  at its expense  for seeking regulatory approvals for and commercializing  the platelet system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore 
under that agreement  bioone received exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
we believe baxter transferred its rights and obligations with regard to bioone to fenwal 
we have received a total of million in up front payments under the terms of the agreement and will be eligible to receive contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales  which will be shared equally between fenwal and us 
in june  we and baxter entered into a definitive agreement with bioone for commercialization of our plasma system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone is responsible  at its expense  for seeking regulatory approvals for and commercializing the plasma system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore 
bioone received exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
we received a total of million in cash as well as equity securities in bioone valued at million at the time of issuance in connection with the agreement and will be eligible to receive i contingent milestone payments  payable to us solely  and ii royalties on future product sales  which will be shared by fenwal and us 
we understand that bioone has reduced its operations considerably in order to conserve cash 
at december   we evaluated the carrying value of our investment in bioone using a 
table of contents variety of criteria 
these criteria included  but were not limited to third party investor interest and participation in recent equity offerings at current pricing  business outlook of bioone and available financial information 
as a result of bioone s position relative to these criteria at december   we have recorded an impairment of million which brings the carrying value of our equity interest in bioone to zero 
united states armed forces in february  we were awarded million under a cooperative agreement with the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense  or dod 
since then  we have been awarded an aggregate of million under awards and cooperative agreements with the dod  all of which was for the continued funding of projects to develop our pathogen inactivation technologies to improve the safety and availability of blood for medical transfusions 
under the terms of the cooperative agreements  we are conducting research on the inactivation of infectious pathogens in blood  including unusual viruses  bacteria and parasites  which are of concern to the united states armed forces 
settlement agreement with baxter during the fourth quarter of  we and baxter resolved several outstanding issues and disputes resulting from the transition services agreement and manufacturing agreement 
as an outcome of those negotiations  on december   we and baxter entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement  or the mrsa 
the mrsa called for the complete and permanent waiver and release of any and all claims we or baxter had on any amounts generated under the transition services agreement 
as a result of entering into the mrsa  we eliminated approximately million in payment obligations to baxter and million in receivables due from baxter which were generated under the agreements and recorded on our balance sheet 
the mrsa required us to pay million to baxter for the settlement 
as such  we recorded a million gain during the year ended december   and a million obligation on our december  balance sheet 
we paid the million payment in satisfaction of the mrsa on january  investment in aduro biotech in november  we announced that we had sold certain assets that made up our former immunotherapy business  including our listeria and killed but metabolically active  or kbma  platform technologies  to a newly formed independent company  anza therapeutics  inc  or anza  financed by venture capital firms 
in exchange for our contribution of tangible and intangible assets to anza  we received preferred stock representing an equity interest of approximately of anza s preferred equity 
however  due to the early clinical and pre clinical stages of anza s technology and relatively high risk of failure for such technologies  we determined that it would be unlikely that we would be able to derive any value from our equity interest in anza and as such  we did not assign a value on our balance sheet to the equity interest we held in anza 
we were informed in february that anza had ceased operations 
in july  we entered into a three way license agreement with anza and aduro biotech  or aduro  and separate agreements with each of anza and aduro collectively  the assignment agreements 
in november  anza transferred all of its intellectual property to aduro pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreements 
in addition  for agreeing to the transfer and surrendering our ownership in anza  we received preferred stock representing a equity interest in aduro  a royalty on all future product sales that aduro may recognize in the future from the transferred technology  and million in cash from aduro 
furthermore  we received cash of approximately million from anza 
as a result of entering into the assignment agreements  we no longer hold any equity in anza 
we believe that aduro s technology platforms  which are largely based on anza s in process development programs  have a high risk of failure and we have no basis to believe that we will receive economic benefit from our equity ownership in aduro 
as such  we did not assign any value to our equity ownership in aduro on our december  balance sheet 

table of contents manufacturing and supply we have used  and intend to continue to use  third parties to manufacture and supply the devices  disposable kits and inactivation compounds that make up the intercept blood system for use in clinical trials and for commercialization 
we have no experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes 
we are dependent on fenwal for the manufacture of intercept blood system disposable kits and on contract manufacturers for the production of inactivation compounds  compound adsorption components of the disposable kits and uva illumination devices used in the intercept blood system 
on december   we entered into an amended and restated manufacturing and supply agreement with fenwal 
under the amended agreement  fenwal is obligated to sell  and we are obligated to purchase  finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems for both clinical and commercial use 
the agreement permits us to purchase platelet and plasma kits from third party manufacturers provided that we meet certain annual minimum purchase obligations to fenwal 
we are responsible for developing and delivering to fenwal our proprietary inactivation compounds and adsorption media for incorporation into the final system configuration 
the term of the fenwal agreement extends through december   and is automatically renewed for one year terms  subject to termination by either party upon thirty months prior written notice  in the case of fenwal  or twenty four months prior written notice  in our case 
we and fenwal each have normal and customary termination rights  including termination for material breach 
following the december fenwal agreement  we are responsible for the full management and control of the supply chain for the intercept illuminator devices and certain other components of the platelet and plasma kits 
in anticipation of this obligation  we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with nova biomedical corporation  or nova  on september  under the terms of the nova agreement  we have the ability to purchase illuminators directly from nova 
nova has manufactured illuminators for baxter and us in the past 
in addition  we previously contracted with nova for the calibration and maintenance of the illuminators that we previously purchased from baxter and fenwal 
nova has also previously supplied to us components of the intercept platelet and plasma systems to cover repair contingencies and for preventive maintenance 
the term of the nova agreement extends through september and is automatically renewable for one year terms  subject to termination by either party upon twelve months prior written notice 
we have contracted with one manufacturing facility for the synthesis of amotosalen  the inactivation compound used in our platelet and plasma systems 
under this contract  we are not subject to minimum annual purchase requirements 
however  if specified quantities of amotosalen are not purchased in any year  we are required to pay a maintenance fee of up to  for such year 
we currently have a stock of the compound sufficient to support the anticipated commercial demand for the platelet and plasma systems 
we and our contract manufacturers  including fenwal and nova  purchase certain raw materials for our disposable kits  inactivation compounds  materials and parts associated with compound absorption devices and uva illumination devices from a limited number of suppliers  some of which may require minimum annual purchase amounts 
while we believe that there are alternative sources of supply for such materials  parts and devices  establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the raw materials  parts and devices  if required  may not be accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs and potential regulatory reviews 
any failure to obtain from alternative suppliers of the materials used to manufacture our disposable kits  inactivation compounds or materials and parts used to manufacture our compound absorption devices and uva illumination devices  if required  would limit our ability to supply these materials  parts or devices 
marketing  sales and distribution the market for the intercept blood system is dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations in the united states  western europe  russia  the middle east  and japan  where various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective 
table of contents nations blood and blood component supplies 
the largest european markets for our products are in england  germany and france 
in england  decisions on product adoption are centralized in the national blood service 
in germany  decisions on product adoption are made on a regional or blood center by blood center basis 
while obtaining ce marks allows us to sell the platelet and plasma systems to blood centers in germany  blood centers in germany must still obtain both local manufacturing approval and national marketing authorization from the paul ehrlich institute before being allowed to sell platelets and plasma components treated with the intercept blood system to transfusing hospitals and physicians 
to date  several blood centers in germany have received such requisite approvals and authorizations for the platelet system 
in france  broad product adoption is dependent on a central decision by the etablissement francais du sang  or efs  and then a national supply contract being negotiated 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement for product costs and related treatment of blood components from governmental authorities and private health care insurers including health maintenance organizations  which are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the extent of coverage and the reimbursement rate for new tests and treatments 
national reimbursement rates for pathogen inactivated platelet and plasma have been agreed upon between the french ministry of health and the efs  however  a budget for adopting pathogen inactivation technologies must be established before we would expect broad commercial adoption of the platelet and plasma systems in france 
we maintain a wholly owned subsidiary  cerus europe bv  headquartered in the netherlands  which focuses its efforts on marketing and selling the intercept blood system in europe  russia  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
we also have a small scientific affairs group in the netherlands that supports the commercialization efforts 
competition we believe that the intercept blood system has certain competitive advantages over competing blood borne pathogen inactivation methods that are either on the market  or in development 
the intercept blood system is designed for use in blood centers  which allows for integration with current blood collection  processing and storage procedures 
certain competing products currently on the market  such as solvent detergent treated plasma  use centralized processing that takes blood products away from the blood center 
one competitor has recently received a ce mark for a pathogen inactivation system for the treatment of platelets and plasma in blood centers 
other competitors are marketing pathogen inactivation products or systems for treating donated plasma in europe 
there are no known competitors in the clinical development stage for pathogen inactivation of red blood cells  though one competitor has initiated a study on pathogen inactivation of whole blood 
in addition to direct competition from other pathogen inactivation methods  we encounter indirect competition from other approaches to blood safety  including methods of testing blood products for bacterial and viral pathogens 
further discussion of the major competitors to our blood product business can be found in the risk factor entitled if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our products and product candidates  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
if competitors encounter difficulties or failures in human clinical trials or in commercial settings  we may face additional clinical  regulatory  and commercial challenges 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for pathogen inactivation of blood products include the breadth and effectiveness of pathogen inactivation processes  the amount of demonstrated reduction in transfusion related adverse events subsequent to adopting pathogen inactivation technology  robustness of treated blood components upon transfusion  ease of use  the scope and enforceability of patent or other proprietary rights  product value  product supply and marketing and sales capability 
in addition  we believe the length of time required for products to be developed and to receive regulatory and  in some cases  reimbursement approval are also important competitive factors 
we believe that the intercept blood system will compete favorably with respect to these factors  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the 
table of contents medical device and biopharmaceutical field is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
accordingly  our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development and introduction of new products 
product development involves a high degree of risk  and there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products 
patents  licenses and proprietary rights our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  to protect trade secrets  to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
as of december   we owned approximately issued or allowed united states patents and approximately issued or allowed foreign patents related to the intercept blood system 
our patents expire at various dates between and in addition  we have pending united states patent applications and have filed corresponding patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty 
we have a license from fenwal to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire at various dates between to proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that any patents owned by or licensed to us will afford protection against competitors or that any pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by  or licensed to  us will result in patents being issued 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
seasonality our business is dependent on the marketing and commercialization of the intercept blood system to customers such as blood banks  hospitals  distributors and other health care providers that have a need for a pathogen inactivation system to treat blood products for transfusion 
since our customer s needs are not based on seasonal trends  seasonality does not have a material effect on our business 
inventory requirements and product return rights our platelet and plasma systems have received regulatory approval for two year shelf lives 
illuminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates 
we own work in process inventory for certain components of intercept disposable kits  finished intercept disposable kits  illuminators  and certain replacement parts for our illuminators 
our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our balance sheet  can take over one year for production to be complete before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out basis 
we use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete  slow moving  or unsalable 
our limited history selling the intercept blood system limits the amount of historical data we have to perform such analysis 
generally  we write down specifically identified obsolete  slow moving  or known unsalable inventory using a number of factors  including product expiration dates  open and unfulfilled orders  and sales forecasts 
we sell the intercept blood system directly to blood banks  hospitals  universities  and government agencies  as well as to distributors in certain regions 
generally  our contracts with our customers do not provide for open return rights  except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective product 
customers at december   we had four customers that each accounted for more than of our outstanding trade receivables and together accounted for approximately of our outstanding trade receivables 
the loss of 
table of contents any one of these customers would have an adverse impact on our business 
to date  we have not experienced collection difficulties from these customers 
see item a financial statements of this annual report on form k for additional details about these customers 
research and development expenses a significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development and we intend to maintain our strong commitment to research and development 
we have incurred total research and development expenses from continuing operations of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see item a financial statements of this annual report on form k for costs and expenses related to research and development  and other financial information for fiscal years   and government regulation we and our products are comprehensively regulated in the united states by the fda and  in some instances  by state and local governments  and by comparable governmental authorities in other countries 
our european investigational plan has been based on the intercept blood system being categorized as class iii drug device combinations under the medical device directives  or the mdd  of the european union 
the european union requires that medical devices affix the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with the mdd 
the intercept blood system for platelets received the ce mark in october the intercept blood system for plasma received the ce mark in november a separate ce mark certification must be received for the red blood cell system to be sold in the european union and in other countries recognizing the ce mark 
in addition  france  switzerland  germany  and austria have separate approval processes for use of the intercept treated products 
the fda regulates drugs  medical devices and biologics under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and other laws  including  in the case of biologics  the public health service act 
these laws and implementing regulations govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacturing  record keeping  storage  labeling  advertising  promotion and pre market clearance or approval of products subject to regulation 
the steps required before a medical device may be approved for marketing in the united states pursuant to a pre market approval application  or pma  include preclinical laboratory and animal tests submission to the fda of an investigational device exemption for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  appropriate tests to show the product s safety  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the product s safety and efficacy for its intended indications  submission to the fda of a pma  and fda review of the pma in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses 
the fda will require a pma for each of the intercept systems for platelets  plasma and red blood cells because the fda considers the intercept blood system a biological medical device 
the fda center for biologics evaluation and research  or cber  is principally responsible for regulating the intercept blood system 
however  before the fda determines whether to approve our blood safety products  we expect our pma to be reviewed by the blood products advisory committee  or bpac  an advisory committee convened by and reporting to the fda 
bpac will make a recommendation to the fda for  or against  approval 

table of contents in order to support our pma for the intercept blood system  we have conducted various types of studies  including toxicology studies to evaluate product safety  laboratory and animal studies to evaluate product effectiveness and human clinical trials to evaluate the safety  tolerability and effectiveness of treated blood components 
since assuming responsibility for regulatory approval of the intercept blood system in the united states under terms of our february and agreements with baxter  we have used the same modular process for our pma application that baxter used for the platelet system in the united states 
the content  order and submission timing of the modules must be approved by the fda  and a modular pma application cannot be approved until all modules have been submitted to  reviewed by and accepted by the fda 
we completed a phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and a supplemental analysis of data from this trial in  and we submitted this information along with several other modules of our pma  to the fda 
the fda has indicated that the clinical trial data and supplemental analysis are not sufficient to support a pma and we have had several interactions with the fda subsequent to the clinical trial 
in november  we presented a plan for a proposed phase iii clinical trial for platelets to the bpac 
the outcome of that meeting was the support for the design and endpoints of a clinical trial for intercept treated platelets  subject to changes regarding the sensitivity of the safety endpoint 
we are currently in discussions with the fda regarding further details of the proposed additional phase iii clinical trial 
the fda also inspects the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice or quality system regulation requirements is satisfactory 
in addition to regulating our blood safety products  cber also regulates the blood collection centers and the blood products that they prepare using the intercept blood system 
as such  prior to engaging in interstate transport of blood components processed using the intercept blood system  the fda will require that our united states based blood center customers obtain site specific licenses 
delay in obtaining these licenses would adversely impact our ability to sell products in the united states 
we believe that  in deciding whether the intercept blood system is safe and effective  regulatory authorities are likely to take into account whether it adversely affects the therapeutic efficacy of blood components as compared to the therapeutic efficacy of blood components not treated with the system  and regulatory authorities will weigh the system s safety  including potential toxicities of the inactivation compounds  and other risks against the benefits of using the system in a blood supply that has become safer 
we have conducted many toxicology studies designed to demonstrate the intercept blood system s safety 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not require further toxicology or other studies of our products 
based on discussions with the fda and european regulatory authorities  we believe that data from human clinical studies is required to demonstrate the safety of treated blood components and their therapeutic comparability to untreated blood components  but that only data from laboratory and animal studies  not data from human clinical studies  will be required to demonstrate the system s efficacy in inactivating pathogens 
in light of these criteria  our clinical trial programs for the intercept blood system consist of studies that differ from typical phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical studies 
we completed a phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and a supplemental analysis of data from this trial in  and submitted this information along with several other modules of our pre market approval application  to the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda has indicated that the clinical trial data and supplemental analysis are not sufficient to support a pre market approval application 
we have had several interactions with the fda subsequent to the clinical trial 
in november  we presented a plan for a proposed phase iii clinical trial for platelets to the fda s blood products advisory committee  or bpac 
the outcome of that meeting was the support for the design and endpoints of a clinical trial for intercept treated platelets  subject to changes regarding the sensitivity of the safety endpoint 
we are currently in discussions with the fda regarding further details of that proposed 
table of contents additional phase iii trial 
however  we have no plans to initiate such a trial unless adequate funding from partners or government agencies is secured 
the intercept blood system for red blood cells preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted using prototype system disposables and devices 
we have or plan to perform laboratory studies to demonstrate equivalency between the prototype and the commercial configuration 
we cannot be certain that these studies will be successful or the fda or foreign regulatory bodies will not require additional studies  which could delay commercialization 
health care reimbursement and reform the future revenue and profitability of biopharmaceutical and related companies as well as the availability of capital to such companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of the united states and foreign governments and third party payors to contain or reduce costs of health care through various means 
in the united states  given federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  it is likely that the united states congress and state legislatures will continue to focus on health care reform and the cost of pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of the products and related treatment are obtained from governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  or hmos 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceuticals  medical devices and services 
the trend toward managed health care in the united states and other countries and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may all affect the prices for our products and our profitability 
employees as of december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in research and development and in selling  general  and administrative activities 
of the employees engaged in selling  general  and administrative activities  were employed by our european subsidiary  cerus europe bv none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

risk factors risk factors our business faces significant risks 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business may suffer  the trading price of our common stock could decline and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
there may be additional risks faced by our business 
other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
the intercept blood system may not achieve broad market acceptance 
we may encounter governmental and transfusion medicine community resistance to commercial adoption for any or all of our products 
in addition to blood banks  our direct customers  we must also address issues and concerns from broad constituencies involved in the healthcare system  from patients  to transfusing physicians  hospitals  private and public sector payors  regulatory bodies and public health authorities 
any one of these constituencies may be able to delay or block adoption of the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to adequately demonstrate to these constituencies that the intercept blood system is safe  effective and economical 
some potential customers may await further safety information or additional studies before choosing whether to adopt our products 
for instance  we have been informed by the largest group of blood centers in germany that it will need to complete a clinical trial before purchasing our products on a routine basis 
we can not predict the final trial design  number of transfusions  enrollment duration  estimated time it will take to complete such a trial  or trial outcome 
for logistical and financial reasons  the transfusion medicine industry has not always integrated new technologies into its processes  even those with the potential to improve the safety of the blood supply  such as the intercept blood system 
our products may require significant changes to our potential customers blood component collection methods  space and staffing requirements and potential customers may not believe that the benefits of using the intercept blood system justify their cost 
there is some loss of platelets as a result of our pathogen inactivation process 
if the loss of platelets leads to increased costs  or our process requires changes in blood center or clinical regimens  customers may not adopt our platelet system 
certain studies have indicated that transfusion of conventionally prepared platelets may yield higher post transfusion platelet counts according to a measurement called corrected count increment and may be more effective than transfusion of intercept treated platelets 
while studies also demonstrate that intercept treated platelets retain therapeutic function comparable to conventional platelets  customers may choose not to adopt our platelet system due to considerations relating to corrected count increment or efficacy 
our products do not inactivate all known pathogens  and the inability of our systems to inactivate certain pathogens may limit their acceptance 
for example  due to the biology of certain non lipid enveloped viruses  including hepatitis a virus  our products have not been demonstrated to inactivate these viruses 
in addition  for human parvovirus b  which is also a non lipid enveloped virus  our testing has not demonstrated a high level of inactivation 
although we have shown high levels of inactivation of a broad spectrum of lipid enveloped viruses  some customers may choose not to adopt our products based on considerations concerning inability to inactivate  or limited inactivation  of certain non lipid enveloped viruses 
in addition  since prions do not contain nucleic acid  our products do not inactivate prions 
while transmission of prions has not been a major problem in blood transfusions  and we are not aware of any competing products that inactivate prions  the inability to inactivate prions may limit market acceptance of our products 
we have conducted pre clinical and clinical studies of our products in both in vivo and in vitro environments using well established tests that are accepted by regulatory bodies 
when an in vitro test was not generally available or not well established  we conducted in vivo studies in mammalian models to predict human responses 
although we have no reason to believe that the in vitro and in vivo studies are not predictive of actual 
table of contents results in humans  we cannot be certain that the results of these in vitro and in vivo studies accurately predict the actual results in humans in all cases 
to the extent that actual results in human patients differs from the results of our in vitro or in vivo testing  market acceptance of our products may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  due to limitations of those tests  we cannot exclude that a sufficient quantity of pathogen or pathogens may still be present in active form which could present a risk of infection to the transfused patient 
such uncertainty may limit the market acceptance of our products 
our products may not demonstrate economic value sufficient to offset their price  imposing a financial burden on the healthcare system that may limit market acceptance 
we may need to develop new product configurations to address market needs  which may be technically challenging  expensive and negatively affect potential contribution from product sales 
if customers experience operational or technical problems with the use of intercept blood system products  market acceptance may be reduced 
for example  if adverse events arise from incomplete inactivation of pathogens  improper processing or user error  or if testing of intercept treated blood samples fails to reliably confirm pathogen inactivation  whether or not directly attributable to a shortcoming of the intercept blood system  customers may refrain from purchasing the products 
in addition  there is a risk that further studies we or others may conduct will show results inconsistent with previous studies 
should this happen  potential customers may delay or choose not to adopt our products  and existing customers may cease use of our products 
market acceptance of our products may also be affected by blood center budgets and the availability of reimbursement from governments  managed care payors  such as insurance companies  or other third parties 
in many cases  due to the structure of the blood products industry  we will have little control over budget and reimbursement discussions  which generally occur between blood centers and national or regional ministries of health and private payors 
even if a particular blood center is prepared to adopt the intercept blood system  its hospital customers may not accept  or may not have the budget to purchase  intercept treated blood products 
since blood centers would likely not eliminate the practice of screening donors or testing blood for pathogens prior to transfusion  even after implementing our products some blood centers may not be able to afford to purchase our products 
furthermore  it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel medical device products 
in certain countries  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of medical products and medical products companies 
there also have been proposals in the united states  at both the federal and state government level  to implement similar controls 
the widespread adoption of managed care in the united states has also placed downward pressure on the pricing of medical products 
these pressures  as well as proposed health care reform measures in the united states  can be expected to continue and may limit the prices we can obtain for our products 
product adoption in europe and other regions may be negatively affected because we do not have fda approval for any of our products 
in addition  failure to gain approval or achieve widespread product adoption in key european countries for reasons within and outside our control may limit adoption in other countries 
the market for the intercept blood system is highly concentrated with few customers  including often dominant regional or national blood collection entities 
even if our products receive regulatory approval and reimbursement is available  failure to properly market  promote  distribute  price or sell our products to any of these large customers could significantly diminish potential product revenue in those geographies 
the market for our pathogen inactivation systems in the united states is highly concentrated  dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations 
in many countries in western europe and in japan  various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood components supply 
in europe  the largest markets for our products are in england  germany and france 
decisions on product adoption in england are centralized with the national blood service 
in germany  decisions on product adoption and subsequent reimbursement are expected to be on a regional or even blood center by blood center basis  but depend on both local and centralized regulatory approval from the paul ehrlich institute  or pei 
product characteristics relating to platelet dose of intercept treated platelets 
table of contents that have received marketing authorization from the pei may be incompatible with market requirements 
while intercept treated platelets and plasma have received in country regulatory approval and reimbursement rates have been established in france  adoption throughout france has been limited to certain blood centers 
the japanese red cross controls a significant majority of blood transfusions in japan and exerts a high degree of influence on the adoption and use of blood safety measures in japan 
the japanese red cross has been reviewing preclinical and clinical data on pathogen inactivation of blood over a number of years and has yet to make a formal determination to adopt the intercept blood system or any other competitive approach 
if approvals are not obtained to market our products in these countries  or if the products are not adopted in these countries  our potential product revenue will be significantly impaired 
our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 
our products  both those sold commercially and those under development are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by local  state and federal regulatory authorities in the united states and by foreign regulatory bodies 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  pre market clearance or approval  sales and distribution  use standards and documentation  post launch surveillance  quality  advertising and promotion  and reimbursement 
clinical trials in particular are expensive and have a high risk of failure 
any of our product candidates may fail in the testing phase or may not achieve results sufficient to attain market acceptance  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
we do not know whether we will begin and conduct planned clinical trials on schedule  if at all 
significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our clinical trials 
we also do not know whether planned clinical trials will need to be revamped or will be completed on schedule  if at all 
criteria for regulatory approval in blood safety indications are evolving with competitive advances in the standard of care against which new product candidates are judged  as well as with changing market needs and reimbursement levels 
clinical trial design  including enrollment criteria  endpoints  and anticipated label claims are thus subject to change  even if original objectives are being met 
in addition to the reasons stated above  clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical study agreement terms with prospective clinical sites  delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective clinical site and delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a study 
we do not know whether any clinical trials will result in marketable products 
typically  there is a high rate of failure for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials and products emerging from any successful trial may not reach the market for several years 

table of contents it may take us several years to complete our clinical testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
enrollment criteria for certain of our clinical trials may be quite narrow 
consequently  we may be unable to recruit suitable patients into the trial on a timely basis  if at all 
we cannot rely on interim results of trials to predict their final results  and acceptable results in early trials might not be repeated in later trials 
any trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
in addition  preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated  require other studies to be performed or cause a program to be terminated  even if other studies or trials relating to a program are successful 
the fda and other agencies in the united states and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the manufacturing and marketing of products such as those we are developing 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is long  expensive and uncertain  and typically takes a number of years  depending on the type  complexity and novelty of the product 
in addition  we may be required to obtain approval from the food and drug branch of the california state department of health for any product manufactured by us in california  including for clinical trial use 
we may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses  or we may not be successful at all 
we have received ce mark approval for the intercept platelet and plasma systems  which  is sufficient to allow us to sell our platelet and plasma systems in the european union and allows us to sell the intercept platelet and plasma systems under import licenses to many countries outside of the european union 
in germany  france  switzerland  and austria  additional regulatory approval of the blood products treated by our products has been required before those blood products can be transfused into a human patient 
intercept treated blood products have received those additional regulatory approvals from the paul ehrlich institute in germany as to the largest branch of the german red cross  the agence fran aise de s curit sanitaire des produits de sant  or afssaps  in france  and swissmedic in switzerland 
we have also obtained in country regulatory approvals for the sale of intercept platelet and plasma systems in russia 
we have not received regulatory approval for commercial sale of the intercept blood system in the united states and many other countries around the world 
our products are in various stages of development and regulatory approval  and we face the risks of failure inherent in developing medical devices and biotechnology products based on new technologies 
our products must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy and we must adhere to quality standards regarding manufacturing and customer facing business processes before the fda and international regulatory authorities can approve them for commercial use 
we must provide the fda and international regulatory authorities with preclinical  clinical and manufacturing data demonstrating that our products are safe  effective and in compliance with government regulations before the products can be approved for commercial sale 
distribution of our products in markets outside the united states also is subject to extensive government regulation 
these regulations vary by country  including the requirements for approvals or clearance to market  the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations 
in some countries  we may be required to register as a medical device manufacturer  even though we outsource manufacturing to third parties 
in addition to ce mark documentation  countries outside the european union may require clinical data submissions  registration packages  import licenses or other documentation 
in may  we obtained a ce mark extension in our name from european union regulators for our platelet system  originally obtained by baxter in  and will need to obtain an extension every five years 
in addition to european union level approval  we must obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals in some individual european countries to market our products 
we or our customers may also be required to conduct additional testing in order to obtain regulatory approval in countries that do not recognize the ce mark as being adequate for commercializing the intercept blood system in those countries 
the level of additional product testing varies by country  but could be expensive or take a long time to complete 
in addition  regulatory agencies are able to withdraw or suspend previously issued approvals 

table of contents we completed our phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and submitted data from this trial  along with several other modules of our pre market approval application  to the fda 
based on discussions with the fda  we performed an additional blinded analysis of the clinical trial data  under the direction of an independent expert physician panel  to determine if apparent differences between treatment groups in the category of pulmonary adverse events reported in the study were attributable to discrepancies in safety results 
the reassessment of primary patient records by the expert physician panel showed no statistically significant differences between groups 
this reassessment differed from the earlier analysis of adverse events that was based on clinical trial case report forms and had shown statistically significant differences in specific pulmonary events 
we submitted a report of the analysis to the fda for review 
we now understand that our reassessment of our previously completed phase iii clinical trial data will not be sufficient to address the fda s questions 
in november  we and the fda presented a proposed clinical trial protocol for a second phase iii clinical trial to the fda s blood product advisory committee  or bpac 
although the bpac agreed with the proposed trial design  safety endpoints and efficacy endpoints  we believe we will need to reach agreement with the fda on the means necessary to satisfy the bpac s request for more stringent safety margins than we had proposed 
satisfying that request will likely require assessing data from additional patients in the trial than what we had proposed 
until the final study size and design requirements are determined  we will not be able to assess the feasibility of a second phase iii trial 
the dimensions of such a phase iii trial may be prohibitively large due either to prospective cost  logistics or both 
we have no plans to initiate such a trial unless adequate funding from partners or government agencies is secured 
the additional phase iii clinical trial will need to be completed and data submitted to the fda before we can complete our regulatory submission 
we have completed phase iiia  phase iiib and phase iiic clinical trials of the plasma system  in the united states  reports for which were filed with the fda during we obtained a ce mark approval in europe of the plasma system in november and final french approval in may based on data from those trials of the plasma system 
we have not submitted any applications for regulatory approval of the plasma system in the united states or any other regions other than europe 
in some countries  including several in europe  we or our customers may be required to perform additional clinical studies or submit manufacturing and marketing applications in order to obtain regulatory approval 
before the fda determines whether to approve the intercept blood system products  we expect our approval applications to be reviewed by bpac 
bpac would then make a recommendation to the fda for  or against  approval 
even if bpac were to recommend approval of one or more of our products  the fda would not necessarily approve those products 
if bpac were to recommend against approval of one or more of our products  the fda would have to take into consideration the points of concern raised by bpac which could affect the approval of the products 
if our product candidates receive approval for commercial sale  their marketing and manufacturing will be subject to continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  such as requirements to comply with good manufacturing practice  or gmp  and iso  a quality management system standard applicable to the products we sell in europe 
the failure to comply with these requirements on an ongoing basis could result in delaying or precluding commercialization efforts in certain geographies  including the united states  and could result in an enforcement action  which could harm our business 
the current manufacturing sites we rely upon for producing the platelet and plasma system products for international distribution and sale are not fda qualified facilities 
the fda will require  and other regulatory authorities may also require  post marketing testing  which can involve significant expense 
governments or regulatory authorities may impose new regulations or other changes or we may discover that we are subject to additional regulations that could further delay or preclude regulatory approval and subsequent adoption of our potential products 
we cannot predict the impact of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action 
we have conducted many toxicology studies to demonstrate the intercept platelet and plasma systems safety  and we have conducted and plan to conduct toxicology studies for the intercept red blood cell system 
table of contents throughout the product development process 
at any time  the fda and other regulatory authorities may require further toxicology or other studies to further demonstrate our products safety  which could delay commercialization 
in addition  the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may alter guidance at any time as to what constitutes acceptable clinical trial endpoints or trial design  which may necessitate our having to redesign our product or proposed clinical trials and cause us to incur substantial additional expense or time in attempting to gain regulatory approval 
we believe the fda and other regulatory authorities are likely to weigh the potential risks of using our pathogen inactivation products against the incremental benefits  which may be less compelling in light of improved safety in the blood supply 
the fda will require us to demonstrate a very low level of potential side effects in the proposed second phase iii trial of the platelet system 
trials of this type may be too large and expensive to be practical 
as a result of the termination of phase iii clinical trials of our red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to red blood cells treated with the intercept red blood cell system in one patient in the chronic arm of the trials  we have been conducting additional research activities on our red blood cell system to determine if the system can be reconfigured to reduce the potential for antibody reactivity to treated red blood cells 
based upon an internal evaluation of the results from these additional research activities and after consulting with regulatory authorities  we initiated a new phase i trial in in the united states using a modified red blood cell system before potentially progressing to later stage clinical trials 
we utilized a manual processing system in the phase i trial conducted in  which system is not in a commercially feasible form 
results of that phase i trial suggested that the modified process in combination with a conventional additive solution results in conditions not suitable for long term storage of red blood cells treated with the intercept system  adversely impacting their lifespan 
consequently  we conducted in vitro and in vivo studies and initiated a new phase i clinical trial in the fourth quarter of to test further modifications to the red blood cell system 
that new phase i clinical trial has been completed  successfully meeting its primary endpoint of red cell recovery measured twenty four hours after transfusion 
in addition to red cell recovery  we also measured red cell lifespan  measured as the half life of red cells circulating in transfusion recipients 
intercept treated red blood cells fell within the established normal reference range for red blood cells 
non treated red cells were above the established normal reference range 
differences in the lifespan between intercept treated red blood cells and non treated red blood cells may inhibit our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or may impair market acceptance if the red blood cell system is successfully developed 
a number of trial design  process and product design issues that could impact efficacy  regulatory approval and market acceptance will need to be resolved prior to the initiation of further clinical trials 
while those clinical trials are being conducted and further clinical work is planned  we will need to develop a commercially feasible red blood cell system 
in the aggregate  these activities will require significant funding beyond our current resources 
we will not commence the next phase of clinical trial activities until we have secured adequate funds 
we expect that we can continue some level of program advancement with minimal spending  by leveraging grant funding from the department of defense and existing and potential partners 
a delay in completing such development activities could result in a delay in the timely progression to later stage trials 
if we are unsuccessful in advancing a modified red blood cell system through clinical trials  resolving process and product design issues or in obtaining subsequent regulatory approvals and acceptable reimbursement rates  we may never realize a return on our development expenses incurred to date in the red blood cell system program 
regulatory delays can also materially impact our product development costs 
if we experience delays in testing  conducting trials or approvals  our product development costs will increase 
for example  we may need to repeat clinical trials to address regulatory or clinical questions 
we may also need to retain third party investigators and organizations in an attempt to facilitate regulatory review and approval 
if the delays are significant  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products will be harmed  and our ability to become profitable will be delayed 
regulatory agencies may limit the uses  or indications  for which any of our products are approved 
for example  we believe that the intercept blood system products will be able to claim the inactivation of 
table of contents particular pathogens only to the extent we have laboratory data to support such claims 
after regulatory approval for the initial indications  further studies may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to us and to our products  there are regulatory requirements in several countries around the world  including the united states  germany  canada  and australia  and other countries  applicable to our prospective customers of intercept blood system products  the blood centers that process and distribute blood and blood products 
in those countries  blood centers and other customers will be required to obtain approved license supplements from the appropriate regulatory authorities in each country before making available blood products processed with our pathogen inactivation systems to hospitals and transfusing physicians 
for example  our customers in germany must obtain separate regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell blood components treated with the intercept blood system 
our customers may lack the resources or capability to obtain such regulatory approvals 
these requirements or regulators delays in approving license applications or supplements may deter some blood centers from using our products 
blood centers that do submit applications or supplements for manufacturing and sale may face disapproval or delays in approval that could provide further delay or deter them from using our products 
the regulatory impact on potential customers could slow or limit the potential sales of our products 
we have limited experience operating a commercial organization 
we rely on third parties to market  sell  and distribute our products and to maintain customer relationships in a certain countries 
since february  we have been fully responsible for sales  marketing  distribution and regulatory support of the intercept blood system worldwide  except in those asian territories covered by our agreements with bioone for the platelet and plasma systems 
if we fail in our efforts to develop or maintain such internal competencies or establish acceptable relationships with third parties on a timely basis  our attempts to commercialize the intercept blood system may be irreparably harmed 
we operate a small organization  headquartered in the netherlands  dedicated primarily to selling and marketing the platelet and plasma systems in geographies where the intercept platelet and plasma systems are approved or can be imported through the import license process 
we will need to maintain and continue to increase our competence in a number of functions  including sales  marketing  regulatory  inventory and logistics  customer service  credit and collections  risk management  and quality assurance systems 
many of these competencies require compliance with european union and local standards and practices  with which we have limited experience 
we have entered into contracts  generally on a geographically exclusive basis  with distributors in countries where we have limited abilities to commercialize our pathogen inactivation products directly 
we have entered into geographical distribution agreements for distribution in spain  italy  portugal  chile  the czech republic  slovakia  russia  poland  greece  kuwait  and qatar 
we rely on these distributors to market and sell the intercept blood system  obtain any necessary in country regulatory approvals  provide customer and technical product support  maintain inventories  and adhere to our quality system in all material respects  among other activities 
while our contracts generally require distributors to exercise diligence  these distributors may fail to commercialize the intercept blood system in their respective territories 
they may fail to sell product inventory they have purchased from us to end customers 
initial purchases of uva illuminators or disposable kits by these third parties may not lead to follow on purchases of disposable platelet and plasma system kits 
we have limited visibility into the identity and requirements of blood banking customers these distributors may have 
these third parties may irreparably harm relationships with local existing and prospective customers and our standing with the blood banking community in general 
we may have little recourse  short of termination  in the event that a distributor fails to execute according to our expectations 

table of contents our product design and manufacturing supply chain is highly technical and exposes us to significant risks in march  baxter sold its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to a new company  fenwal  inc fenwal has agreed  through an agreement signed with us in december  to manufacture disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems for us through the end of however  fenwal may fail to manufacture an adequate supply of disposable kits or to do so on a cost effective basis  which would subject us to loss of revenue and reduced contribution margin 
fenwal may fail to coordinate or meet interdependent supply chain obligations  leading to a failure to manufacture an adequate supply of components or devices of the intercept blood system  which would also subject us to the risks described below 
we contract with independent suppliers  including nova biomedical corporation  or nova  for the manufacture of uva illuminators and certain components of the intercept blood system which are manufactured or assembled at facilities not owned by fenwal or baxter 
nova has not manufactured uva illuminators for a number of years 
should nova have difficulties manufacturing uva illuminators  we may not be able to supply customer demand or provide replacement uva illuminators to existing customers 
facilities at which the intercept blood system or its components are manufactured may cease operations for planned or unplanned reasons  causing at least temporary interruptions in supply 
for our product components  including assembly  we do not have qualified suppliers beyond those on whom we currently rely  and we understand that fenwal relies substantially on sole suppliers of certain materials for our products 
if we need to or choose to identify and qualify alternate suppliers  the process will be time consuming and costly 
even a temporary failure to supply adequate numbers of intercept blood system components may cause an irreparable loss of customer goodwill 
if we conclude that supply of the intercept blood system or components from fenwal and others is uncertain  we may choose to build and maintain inventories of raw materials  work in process components  or finished goods  which would consume capital resources and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient 
some components of the intercept blood system  including components of the uva illuminator device  are no longer manufactured  which will require us to identify and qualify replacement components and may require that we conduct additional studies  which could include clinical trials  to demonstrate equivalency or validate any required design or component changes 
future supply of illuminators is limited to availability of components  some of which are in short supply or are no longer manufactured 
we will likely be required to redesign the illuminator used in the platelet and plasma systems to manage the risk of obsolete components 
such redesign may be expensive and lead to regulatory delays in obtaining approvals to market the redesigned device 
fenwal manufactures our platelet and plasma systems in facilities that are not fda approved 
in order to be sold in the united states  our systems would be required to be manufactured in fda approved facilities 
fda validation of manufacturing facilities  whether owned by fenwal or by other parties  will be costly and time consuming 
if we determine to establish alternate manufacturers  we will also be dependent on fenwal to transfer know how relevant to the manufacture of the intercept blood system  however  certain of fenwal s materials  manufacturing processes and methods are proprietary to fenwal 
we may be unable to establish alternate sources of supply to fenwal  nova  or other suppliers without having to redesign certain elements of the platelet and plasma systems 
such redesign may be costly  time consuming and require further regulatory review  which would delay our ability to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems 
fenwal is not obligated to provide support for development and testing of improvements or changes we may make to the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to identify  select  and qualify such manufacturers or those third parties able to provide support for development and testing activities on a timely basis or enter into contracts with them on reasonable terms  if at all 
raw material and component suppliers may not meet quality specifications we have set  which would cause a disruption in supply and may lead to lost sales and irreparable damage to our customer relationships 
moreover  the inclusion of components manufactured by new suppliers could require us to seek new or updated approvals from regulatory authorities  which could result in delays in product delivery 
we may not receive any such required regulatory approvals 

table of contents in the event of a failure by fenwal or other manufacturers to perform their obligations to supply components of the intercept blood system to us  damages recoverable by us may be insufficient to compensate us for the full loss of business opportunity 
our supply agreements with fenwal and nova  and supply agreements with others contain limitations on incidental and consequential damages that we may recover 
a supplier s potential liability in the event of non performance may not be sufficient to compel the supplier to continue to act in conformity with our agreements 
we are in the early stages of commercializing the intercept blood system and may not accurately forecast demand for the intercept blood system 
in addition  we generally require our distributors to provide us with sales forecasts and binding purchase orders and as such  we may make inventory purchase decisions based on these forecasts 
we have contracted with third parties to supply platelet and plasma systems and components to meet forecasted demand 
however  such forecasts may prove to be either higher or lower than actual commercial demand 
as a result  we may carry excess work in process or finished goods inventory  which would consume capital resources and may become obsolete  or our inventory may be inadequate to meet customer demand 
we have entered into certain public tenders  some which call for us to maintain certain minimum levels of inventory 
if fenwal or third party manufacturers fail to produce components or our finished products satisfactorily  at acceptable costs  and in sufficient quantities  we may incur delays  shortfalls and additional expenses  or non compliance with certain public tenders which may in turn result in permanent harm to our customer relations or loss of customers 
our platelet and plasma system disposables have received regulatory approval for two year shelf lives 
we and our distributors may be unable to ship product to customers prior to the expiration of product shelf life  which would require that we destroy or consume the outdated inventory in product demonstration activities 
product expiration may in turn lead to elevated product demonstration costs or reduced gross margins 
the platelet system is not compatible with some commercial platelet collection methods and platforms and platelet storage solutions 
the equipment and materials used to collect platelets vary by manufacturer and by geographic region 
platelets may be collected from a single donor by apheresis using an automated collection machine 
apheresis devices currently used in the united states and european markets differ  among other characteristics  in their ability to collect platelets in reduced volumes of plasma 
platelet concentrates may also be prepared from whole blood by pooling together platelets from multiple donors 
there are two commonly used methods for preparing whole blood platelets the buffy coat method  which is used extensively in europe  and the pooled random donor method  which is used in the united states 
our system for platelets is designed to work with platelets collected and stored in storage solutions  called intersol and ssp  and for platelets suspended in plasma 
for platelets collected by apheresis  the intercept platelet system is most compatible with fenwal s apheresis platelet collection system  because it facilitates the use of intersol 
for platelets prepared from whole blood  our platelet system is most compatible with the buffy coat collection method 
as a result  we have conducted most of our clinical studies using either fenwal s equipment or buffy coat platelets 
fenwal may be required to obtain separate regulatory approval for intersol in the united states and in countries which do not recognize ce mark approval before customers would be able to use intersol with the intercept blood system in those countries 
in order to address the entire market in the united states  we would need to develop and test additional configurations of the platelet system 
our efforts to develop the platelet system were initially focused on apheresis platelets collected on fenwal s automated collection platform or using the buffy coat collection method 
we estimate that the majority of platelets used in the united states are collected by apheresis  though a significant minority is prepared from pooled random donor platelets derived from whole blood collections 
in order to gain regulatory approvals for a pathogen inactivation system compatible with random donor platelets  we will need to perform additional product development and testing  including additional clinical trials 
similarly  to achieve market acceptance in certain geographies  we may be required to design  develop and test new product 
table of contents configurations for the platelet and plasma systems 
these development activities would increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
fenwal has committed to us to make intersol collection and pooling products and conversion kits available to customers 
however  fenwal may not make such products or its apheresis collection system available for sale timely or in certain countries and has elected to discontinue sales efforts for its apheresis collection system in japan 
other manufacturers supplying blood component collection platforms to the market may resist our efforts to make the intercept blood system compatible with their platforms 
attaining compatibility with collection platforms manufactured by others may require adaptations to either the intercept blood system or to the collection platforms  which may be difficult to engineer  expensive to implement and test  require additional clinical trials  cause delays in regulatory approval and or be commercially unattractive to pursue 
these development activities will increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
market acceptance of the intercept blood system may be delayed until the system receives regulatory approval for use on such other equipment  if required 
we have used prototype components in our preclinical studies and clinical trials of the intercept red blood cell system and have not completed the components commercial design 
we will be required to identify and enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture the red blood cell system and related blood component storage solutions 
our red blood cell system that we used in our preclinical studies and recently completed phase i red blood cell trial are prototypes of systems to be used in the final products 
as a result  we expect regulatory authorities will require us to perform additional preclinical and clinical studies using the commercial versions of the systems to demonstrate the acceptability of the commercial configuration and the equivalence of the prototypes and the commercial products  which may increase our expenses and delay the commercialization of our products 
we may determine that although the modified red blood cell system may overcome technical issues encountered in the past  it may not be commercially feasible from potential customers perspectives 
if we fail to develop commercial versions of the intercept red blood cell system on schedule  our potential revenue would be delayed or diminished and our potential competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do 
in addition  the design and engineering effort required to complete the final commercial product will likely be substantial and time consuming 
as with any complex development effort  we expect to encounter design  engineering and manufacturing issues 
such issues have previously arisen  sometimes unexpectedly  and solutions to these issues have not always been readily forthcoming 
additional unforeseen design  engineering and manufacturing issues may arise in the future  which could increase the development cost and delay commercialization of our products 
we will need to identify and contract with parties to perform manufacturing related to our red blood cell system  including the chemical compounds used in the red blood cell system 
it may be difficult to enter into these types of agreements on reasonable terms 
we may be unable to identify and contract with manufacturers that can make our products cost effectively  which would delay our efforts to commercialize the red blood cell system  even if we successfully complete clinical development 
any new or additional commercial manufacturer will need to develop new methods and processes to manufacture these compounds on a commercial scale and demonstrate to us  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities that its commercial scale manufacturing processes comply with government regulations and that its compounds are equivalent to originally licensed compounds in order for us to maintain commercial licensure of our products 
it may be difficult or impossible to economically manufacture our products on a commercial scale 

table of contents bioone may fail to take advantage of commercialization rights for our platelet and plasma systems in many asian countries 
baxter and we licensed to bioone rights to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  vietnam  thailand  and singapore 
bioone is subject to similar risks in its territories regarding commercialization of the intercept blood system as we are 
bioone is solely responsible for obtaining regulatory approvals  marketing and selling the platelet and plasma systems in countries where it holds licenses to commercialize the intercept platelet and plasma systems 
bioone is dependent on fenwal and us for the manufacture and supply of the platelet and plasma systems 
bioone may be unable to qualify the platelet and plasma systems for sale in certain countries in its territory 
bioone has made little progress to date in commercializing the platelet and plasma systems in asian territories 
because we only have a minority investment interest in bioone  we lack the ability to significantly influence bioone  and are reliant on bioone s performance to realize milestone and royalty revenue from commercialization of our platelet and plasma systems in those countries 
in japan  regulatory authorities may require our platelet and plasma systems to be widely adopted commercially in europe or approved by the fda before the platelet and plasma systems are considered for approval in japan  which would delay or prevent bioone from achieving significant product revenue 
in july  bioone raised limited additional capital in order to fund curtailed operations 
at these reduced operating levels  we expect that bioone s ability to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems in its asian territories is compromised 
we understand that bioone will need to raise additional capital to continue its operations beyond the near term and we do not know if it will be able to complete such a financing at or above our carrying value or at all 
there is no assurance that bioone will be able to attract additional required capital in the future to successfully commercialize those products licensed from fenwal and us 
even if bioone fails to commercialize the intercept blood system in its territories  we may be unable to assert contractual rights to regain commercialization rights on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our products and product candidates  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
we expect our products to encounter significant competition 
the intercept blood system products compete with other approaches to blood safety currently in use  and may compete with future products that may be developed by others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes brought about by the development and introduction of new products 
product development is risky and uncertain  and we cannot assure you that we will develop our products successfully 
competitors products or technologies may make our products obsolete or non competitive before we are able to generate any significant revenue 
in addition  competitors or potential competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
they may also have greater experience in preclinical testing  human clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures 
several companies have  or are developing  technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for products that will directly compete with or reduce the market for our pathogen inactivation systems 
a number of companies are specifically focusing on alternative strategies for pathogen inactivation in platelets and plasma 
these alternative strategies may be more effective in inactivating certain types of pathogens from blood products  including non lipid enveloped pathogens  such as hepatitis a virus  which our products have not demonstrated an ability to inactivate  or human parvovirus b  for which our products have not demonstrated a high level of inactivation 
while our products can effectively inactivate a broad spectrum of pathogens in blood components  including more robust inactivation of many pathogens than has been shown by other companies  market acceptance of our products may be reduced if customers determine that competitor s products inactivate a broader range of pathogens that are of particular interest to the transfusion medicine community 
in europe  several companies  including grifols sa  octapharma ag and macopharma international  are developing or selling commercial pathogen inactivation systems or services to treat fresh frozen plasma 
caridianbct is developing a pathogen inactivation system for blood products and has been issued ce marks for a pathogen 
table of contents reduction system for both platelets and plasma 
we understand that caridianbct has also commenced trials on a pathogen inactivation system for whole blood  which if successful  may offer competitive advantages over our intercept blood system 
new methods of testing whole blood for specific pathogens have been approved by the fda and in europe  as have tests for bacteria in platelets 
other companies are developing rapid  point of care bacterial tests  synthetic blood product substitutes and products to stimulate the growth of platelets 
development and commercialization of any of these or other related technologies could limit the potential market for our products 
we may be liable and we may need to withdraw our products from the market if our products harm people 
we may be liable if an accident occurs in our controlled use of hazardous materials 
our insurance coverage may be inadequate to offset losses we may incur 
we are exposed to potential liability risks inherent in the testing and marketing of medical devices and pharmaceutical products 
we may be liable if any of our products cause injury  illness or death 
although we will have completed rigorous preclinical and clinical safety testing prior to marketing our products  there may be harmful effects caused by our products that we are unable to identify in preclinical or clinical testing 
in particular  unforeseen  rare reactions or adverse side effects related to long term use of our products may not be observed until the products are in widespread commercial use 
because of the limited duration and number of patients receiving blood components treated with the intercept blood system products in clinical trials  it is possible that harmful effects of our products not observed in clinical and preclinical testing could be discovered after a marketing approval has been received 
for example  in cases where we have obtained regulatory approval for our products  we have demonstrated pathogen inactivation to specified levels based on well established tests 
however  there is no way to determine  after treatment by our products  whether our products have completely inactivated all of the pathogens that may be present in blood components 
there is also no way to determine whether any residual amount of a pathogen remains in the blood component treated by our products and there is no way to exclude that such residual amount would be enough to cause disease in the transfused patient 
for ethical reasons  we cannot conduct human testing to determine whether an individual who receives a transfusion of a blood component containing a pathogen that was inactivated using the intercept blood system might show positive results if tested for an antibody against that pathogen 
while we believe  based on the clinical experience of our scientists  that the level of inactivated pathogens would likely be too small to induce a detectable antibody response in diagnostic tests  we cannot exclude that a transfused patient might show positive results if tested for an antibody against that pathogen 
we could be subject to a claim from a patient that tests positive  even though that patient did not contract a disease 
later discovery of problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in additional restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
we are subject to risks and costs of product recall  which include not only potential out of pocket costs  but also potential interruption to our supply chain 
in such an event  our customer relations would be harmed and we would incur unforeseen losses 
we maintain product liability insurance  but do not know whether the insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including certain hazardous chemicals  radioactive materials and infectious pathogens  such as hiv and hepatitis viruses 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials are adequate and comply with regulatory requirements  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury 
if an accident occurs  we could be held liable for any damages that result 

table of contents if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our future operations or if we are unable to generate positive cash flows from our operations  we will need to curtail planned development or sales and commercialization activities 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical development of our platelet and red blood cell systems  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we believe that our available cash balances will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth on terms that may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to product revenues  our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our ability to raise additional capital by selling common stock is limited 
all of our authorized common stock have been either issued or reserved for issuance in connection with convertible preferred stock  warrants  our employee stock purchase plan  and our equity incentive plan 
accordingly  in order to have shares available for future sale  we and our stockholders will need to approve an authorization to increase the number of shares that are issuable under our certificate of incorporation 
our ability to raise additional capital may also be adversely impacted by global  regional or national economic conditions 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional capital we may need to curtail planned development 
we expect to prioritize continued commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in europe  russia  the middle east and in selected countries in other regions around the world over development and commercialization of the red blood cell system and pursuit of regulatory approval of the platelet or plasma system in the united states 
historically  we had received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the dod 
further funding awarded under federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood systems may decline when compared to historic levels 
access to federal grants and cooperative agreements is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the united states congress 
if we are unable to obtain federal grant and cooperative agreement funding for future research and development activities at levels similar to past funding  we may need to reduce our operating expenses  which would delay progress in some of our development programs 
we have only a limited operating history  and we expect to continue to generate losses 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
our development and selling  general  and administrative expenses have resulted in substantial losses each year since our inception with the exception of the 
table of contents year ended december  at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the platelet and plasma systems are not yet approved in the united states or in many other countries around the world 
the red blood cell system is in early stage clinical development and may never emerge from the clinical development stage as a marketed product 
we may be required to reduce the sales price for our products in order to make our products economically attractive to our customers and to governmental and private payors  which may reduce or altogether eliminate our gross profit on sales 
at our present sales levels of the platelet and plasma systems  our costs to manufacture  distribute  market  sell  support and administer the systems are in excess of revenue 
contribution from product sales is unlikely to exceed the costs we incur in research  development  and commercialization of the intercept blood system for near term 
we expect our losses to continue at least until the intercept blood system achieves more significant market acceptance 
to the extent that we are able to secure funding from partners or government agencies for further development of the red blood cell system or an additional phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states  we will incur costs of such activities would extend the period during which we expect to operate at a loss 
our investment portfolio may become impaired by further deterioration of the capital markets 
our cash equivalent and short term investment portfolio as of december  consisted primarily of high credit  high liquidity united states government agency securities  asset backed securities  corporate debt securities  money market funds and interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor  manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 
as a result of adverse financial market conditions  investments in some financial instruments  such as structured investment vehicles  sub prime mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities and collateralized debt obligations  may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
we have limited holdings of these investments in our portfolio  however  the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets have negatively affected investments in many industries  including those in which we invest 
we did not recognize any other than temporary impairments on our investment portfolio during the recent global economic crisis has had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on the market values of the investments in our investment portfolio 
we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not deteriorate further or that the institutions that these investments are with will be able to meet their debt obligations at the time we may need to liquidate such investments or until such time as the investments mature 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from a single site that may be subject to lengthy business interruption in the event of a severe earthquake 
we also may suffer loss of computerized information and may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from our facilities in concord  california  which are within an active earthquake fault zone 
should a severe earthquake occur  we might be unable to occupy our facilities or conduct research and development and general and administrative activities in support of our business and products until such time as our facilities could be repaired and made operational 
our property and casualty and business interruption insurance in general does not cover losses caused by earthquakes 
while we have taken certain measures to protect our scientific  technological and commercial assets  a lengthy or costly disruption due to an earthquake would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have also taken measures to limit damage that may occur from the loss of computerized data due to power outage  system or component failure  or corruption of data files 
however  we may lose critical computerized data  which may be difficult or impossible to recreate  which may harm our business 
we may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems  which may subject us to fines or adverse consequences  up to and including loss of our abilities to conduct business 

table of contents we do not anticipate receiving significant economic benefit from the spin off of our immunotherapy business 
in november  we spun off our immunotherapy business to anza therapeutics  inc for preferred stock representing an equity interest of approximately of anza s preferred equity 
we were informed that anza had ceased operations by march  in july  we and anza s remaining stockholders agreed that we would relinquish our ownership in anza and that anza would transfer all of its intellectual property to aduro biotech inc  or aduro 
in november  in exchange for the transfer  we received million in cash  preferred shares representing of aduro s capital and a royalty on any future sales resulting from the transferred technology 
there is no assurance that the equity we have received in aduro will have monetary value at or that we will receive any royalties from aduro 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or operate our business without infringing intellectual property rights of others 
our commercial success will depend  in part  on obtaining and maintaining patent protection on our products and successfully defending our products against third party challenges 
our technology will be protected from unauthorized use only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or effectively maintained as trade secrets 
as a result  our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we cannot be certain that our patents or patents that we license from others will be enforceable and afford protection against competitors 
our patents or patent applications  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
others may independently develop technologies similar to ours or independently duplicate our technologies 
for example  a united states patent issued to a third party covers methods to remove psoralen compounds from blood products 
we have reviewed the patent and believe there exist substantial questions concerning its validity 
we cannot be certain  however  that a court would hold the patent to be invalid or not infringed by our platelet or plasma systems  if and when those products are sold in the united states 
our key blood safety patents generally expire at various dates between and recent patent applications will  if granted  result in patents with later expiration dates 
in addition  we have a license from fenwal to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire from to due to the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of our potential products  our patents may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantage of the patents 
we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
we may need to license the right to use third party patents and intellectual property to continue development and commercialization of our products 
we may not be able to acquire such required licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain such licenses  we may need to design around other parties patents  or we may not be able to proceed with the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
we may face litigation to defend against claims of infringement  assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how or determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
patent litigation is costly 
in addition  we may require interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions relating to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings could be expensive and time consuming  and we could be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights 

table of contents we may rely  in certain circumstances  on trade secrets to protect our technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees and certain contractors 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others  disputes also may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
as our international operations grow  we may be subject to adverse fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar and foreign currencies 
consequently  we may suffer losses 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  among other factors differing political  economic  and regulatory climates  different tax structures  and foreign exchange volatility 
we do not currently enter into any hedging contracts to normalize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
as a result  our future results could be materially affected by changes in these or other factors 
product sales of our blood safety products are typically made in europe and generally are invoiced to customers in euros 
in addition  we purchase finished disposable kits for our platelet and plasma systems and incur operating expenses in euros and other foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility is a direct result of our product sales  cash collection and expenses to support our international operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as a component of interest expense and other  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
significant fluctuations in the volatility of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar may materially affect our results of operations 
currently we do not have any near term plans to enter into a formal hedging program to mitigate the effects of foreign currency volatility 
the market price of our stock may be highly volatile 
the market prices for our securities and those of other emerging medical device and biotechnology companies have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
for example  during the period from january  to december   the sale price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq global market fluctuated within a range from a low of to a high of 
announcements may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
such announcements may include decisions regarding reimbursement and commercial adoption by customers  national blood services or governmental bodies  biological or medical discoveries  technological innovations discovered or new commercial services offered by us or our competitors  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  regulatory developments  status of development partnerships  dilution from future issuances of common stock  including through the exercise of vested stock options  debt financings  with terms that may not be viewed favorably by stockholders  public concern as to the safety of new technologies  general market conditions  comments made by analysts  including changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  and quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and financial results 
recently  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations due to the unprecedented turmoil and upheaval of the credit markets and the financial services industry  which have particularly affected 
table of contents the market prices for emerging biotechnology and medical device companies  and has adversely affected the market price of our common stock 
our stock price may not meet the minimum bid price for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the nasdaq global market or if we are unable to transfer our listing to another stock market 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global market 
the nasdaq stock market llc  or nasdaq  has minimum requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on the nasdaq global market 
these requirements include maintaining a minimum closing bid price of per share 
if our common stock does not maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share  we may be subject to delisting by nasdaq for failure to meet the continued listing requirements 
delisting from the nasdaq global market could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities  would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock 
delisting could also have other negative results  including the potential loss of confidence by employees  the loss of investor interest and fewer business development opportunities 
we may fail to comply fully with elements of the sarbanes oxley act of our failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of this act could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accountants attesting to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
these requirements extend to the operations of our subsidiary in europe 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude in future periods that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of if we cannot favorably assess  or our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
provisions of our charter documents  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our stockholders 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay  deter or prevent a change in control 
the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law  unless its application has been waived  provides certain default anti takeover protections in connection with transactions between the company and an interested stockholder of the company 
generally  section prohibits stockholders who  alone or together with their affiliates and associates  own more than of the subject company from engaging in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder of such subject company without approval of the board or the vote of two thirds of the shares held by the independent stockholders 
our board of directors has also adopted a stockholder rights plan  or poison pill  which would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 
additionally  provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could deter  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders  including without limitation  the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine

overview since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development  clinical testing and commercialization of blood safety systems and  from until late  immunotherapies for cancer and infectious disease 
our intercept platelet system  or the platelet system  and our intercept plasma system  or the plasma system  have received ce marks and are being marketed in europe  russia  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
we are pursuing regulatory approvals for the platelet and plasma systems in the united states and other countries 
the intercept red blood cell system  or the red blood cell system  is in early stage clinical development 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical development of our platelet and red blood cell systems  timing and magnitude of payments under awards from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in 
table of contents large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we believe that cash received from product sales and our available cash balances will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we expect to prioritize continued commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in europe  russia  the middle east and in selected countries in other regions around the world over pursuit of development and commercialization of the red blood cell system  or regulatory approval of the platelet or plasma systems in the united states 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth on terms that may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
all of our authorized common stock have been either issued or reserved for issuance in connection with convertible preferred stock  warrants  our employee stock purchase plan  and our equity incentive plan 
accordingly  in order to have shares available for future sale  we and our stockholders will need to approve an authorization to increase the number of shares that are issuable under our certificate of incorporation and we cannot guarantee that our stockholders would approve such an increase 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
the credit markets and the financial services industry have continued to experience turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain and the terms less favorable to the companies seeking to raise financing 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms 
if we are unable to raise additional capital due to the disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the united states and worldwide or other factors  we will need to curtail planned development and commercialization activities 
we recognize growing  but still relatively modest  product revenues from the sale of our platelet and plasma systems in europe  russia  the middle east  and certain other countries around the world 
we must conduct significant research  development  preclinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities for our products that  together with anticipated selling  general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after our platelet and plasma systems gain widespread commercial acceptance in europe  russia  the middle east  and selected countries in other regions around the world 
our ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our blood safety products 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
subject to the availability of adequate funding from partners  government grants  and or capital markets  we also anticipate continuing our expenditures in support of preclinical and clinical trials and device development of our red blood cell system over the next several years 
we pay royalties to fenwal on product sales  at rates of of net sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system  for the red blood cell system  and on sales of uva illuminators 
in december  we amended and extended our supply agreement with fenwal for the manufacture of intercept finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems through december  under the amended manufacturing agreement  we pay fenwal a set price per kit  which is established annually  plus a fixed surcharge per kit 
in addition  volume driven manufacturing overhead will be paid or refunded if actual manufacturing volumes are lower or higher than the annually estimated production volumes 
under the amended manufacturing 
table of contents agreement  we are responsible for providing certain disposable kit components to fenwal at no cost to fenwal 
this required us to enter into supply arrangements with certain other manufacturers for those components  some of which contain minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our consolidated balance sheet  can take over one year to complete production before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
we have worldwide commercialization rights for the intercept blood systems  except in certain parts of asia 
bioone is responsible for commercializing the platelet and plasma systems  including regulatory efforts  in those certain parts of asia 
at december   we owned approximately of the equity interest in bioone and evaluate the carrying value of our investment in bioone using a variety of criteria 
these criteria included  but are not limited to third party investor interest and participation in recent equity offerings at current pricing  business outlook of bioone and available financial information 
as a result of bioone s position relative to these criteria  at december   we have recorded an impairment of million which brings the carrying value of our equity interest in bioone to zero 
in november  we spun off our immunotherapy business to anza therapeutics  inc  or anza for preferred stock representing and equity interest of approximately of anza s preferred equity 
we accounted for the immunotherapy business as a discontinued operation and restated our consolidated financial statements for and prior periods to reflect that accounting treatment 
we were informed in february that anza had ceased operations 
in july  we entered into a three way license agreement with anza and aduro biotech and separate agreements with each of anza and aduro biotech collectively  the assignment agreements 
in november  anza transferred all of its intellectual property to aduro biotech  or aduro  pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreements 
in exchange for agreeing to the transfer and for relinquishing our shares in anza and releasing any claims against anza  we received million in cash  preferred shares representing of aduro s capital and a royalty on any future sales resulting from the transferred technology 
because aduro s technology and efforts are in the very early stage of research and development  we have no basis to assign value to the equity we have received in aduro or that such equity will have monetary value at such time we are allowed to sell it or that we will receive any royalties from aduro 
through december   in addition to the product revenues from sales of our platelet and plasma systems  we have recognized revenue from grants and cooperative agreements with the armed forces 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accrued liabilities  non cash stock compensation assumptions  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an agreement with the funding party exists  ii services have been rendered or product has been delivered  iii pricing is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
revenue related to product sales is generally recognized when we fulfill our obligations for each element of an agreement 
for all sales of our intercept blood system products  we use a binding purchase order and 
table of contents signed sales contract as evidence of a written agreement 
we sell intercept blood system for platelets and plasma directly to blood banks  hospitals  universities  government agencies  as well as to distributors in certain regions 
generally  our contracts with customers do not provide for open return rights  except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of non conforming product 
deliverables and the units of accounting vary according to the provisions of each purchase order or sales contract 
for revenue arrangements with multiple elements  we evaluate whether the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer  whether the fair value of the undelivered elements is reliably determinable  and whether the delivery of the remaining elements is probable and within our control 
when all of these conditions are met  we recognize the revenue on the delivered elements 
if these conditions are not met  we defer revenue until such time as all of the conditions have been met or all of the elements have been delivered 
consideration received is allocated to elements that are identified as discrete units of accounting based on the relative fair market value method 
freight costs charged to customers are recorded as a component of revenue and value added taxes  or vat  that we invoice to our customers and remit to governments are recorded on a net basis  which excludes such vat from product revenue 
revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the projects are incurred 
we receive certain united states government grants and contracts that support research in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
revenue associated with these grants is recognized as costs under each grant are incurred 
inventory we own work in process inventory for certain components of intercept disposable kits  finished intercept disposable kits  illuminators  and certain replacement parts for our illuminators 
our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our consolidated balance sheet  can take over one year to complete production before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
under our manufacturing agreement with fenwal  our carrying value of intercept disposable kits is dependent on an annually set price 
in addition  at the end of each year  volume driven manufacturing overhead is either paid or refunded by or to us if manufacturing volumes are higher or lower than the anticipated manufacturing volumes at the time the price is established 
as a result  at each interim period  manufacturing overhead can fluctuate and requires us to use judgment in accruing the manufacturing overhead 
in addition  we use judgment in determining whether the manufacturing overhead is a cost of our inventory and recoverable when product is sold 
we use significant judgment and evaluate manufacturing variances incurred during periods of abnormally low production by considering a variety of factors including the reasons for low production volumes  anticipated future production levels that correlate to and offset volumes experienced during abnormally low production cycles  and contractual requirements 
we record manufacturing variances incurred during periods of abnormally low production volumes as a component of cost of product revenue when production volumes are abnormally low 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
our platelet and plasma system disposable kits generally have a two year shelf life from the date of manufacture 
illuminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates 
we use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete  slow moving  or unsalable and frequently review such determinations 
our limited history selling the intercept blood system limits the amount of historical data we have to perform this analysis 
generally  we write down specifically identified obsolete  slow moving  or known unsalable inventory that has no alternative use  using a number of factors including product expiration dates  open and unfulfilled orders  and sales forecasts 
accrued expenses we record accrued liabilities for expenses related to certain contract research activities and development services  including those related to clinical trials  preclinical safety studies and external laboratory studies  as well as transition services and development activities being performed by third parties 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
specifically  accruals for clinical trials require us to make estimates surrounding costs associated with patients at various stages of the clinical trial  pass through costs to clinical sites  contract research organization costs including fees  database development  and reporting costs  among others 

table of contents stock based compensation we issue stock based awards to our employees  members of our board of directors  our scientific advisory board and certain contractors as strategic  long term incentives 
we recorded stock based compensation expense for employee awards in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of a stock award 
we continue to apply the provisions of accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunctions with selling  goods or services  for our non employee stock based awards 
under the provisions  the measurement date at which the fair value of the stock based award is measured is equal to the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the grantee to earn the equity instrument is reached or ii the date at which the grantee s performance is complete 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for the fair value of the vested portion of the non employee awards in our consolidated statements of operations 
the black scholes option pricing model calculates the grant date fair value using certain variables 
these variables are impacted by our stock price  award exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and our expected dividends and many of these variables require us to use significant judgment 
expected term 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using a variety of factors 
where possible  we estimate the expected term of options granted by analyzing employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior 
to make this estimation  we analyze the population of options granted by discrete homogeneous groups 
for those homogeneous groups where we are unable to obtain sufficient information to estimate the expected term in this manner  we estimate the expected term of the options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
the expected term of employee stock purchase plan shares is the term of each offering period 
estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate the forfeiture rate of options at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we estimate the historic pre vesting forfeiture rates by groups that possess a degree of homogeneity regarding average time to vest and expected term 
all stock based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
estimated volatility 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using historical volatility of our common stock 
we have used significant judgment in making these estimates and we will continue to monitor the availability of actively traded options on our common stock 
if we determine that sufficient actively traded options on our common stock exist  we may consider a combination of historical and implied volatility  or solely implied volatility 
risk free interest rate 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on united states treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
expected dividend 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
if factors change and we utilize different assumptions in determining the grant date fair value of stock compensation expense in the future  or if we utilize a different option pricing model in the future  then those results may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating results 
there is significant risk that the black scholes option pricing model and the judgment we have used in ascertaining the variables will yield results that differ materially from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  termination or forfeitures of the awards in the future 
historical results were utilized in deriving our variables  which may not be indicative of the future 
income taxes since our inception  we have accumulated significant net operating losses and research and development credits that may be used in future periods to offset future taxable income 
we currently estimate 
table of contents that we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we may not generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits 
timing and significance of any estimated future taxable income is highly subjective and is beyond the control of management due to uncertainties in market conditions  economic environments in which we operate  and timing of regulatory approval of our products 
we do not recognize tax positions that have a lower than likelihood of being recognized upon review by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
use of a valuation allowance is not an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position 
we did not have any recorded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits at december  or we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense 
to date  we have not recognized any interest and penalties in our statements of operations  nor have we accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties 
we continue to carry a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets 
although we believe it more likely than not that a taxing authority would agree with our current tax positions  there can be no assurance that the tax positions we have taken will be substantiated by a taxing authority if reviewed 
results of operations years ended december    and revenue years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentages product revenue government grant and cooperative agreements total revenue product revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the prior year 
this increase was largely driven by an increase in the number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold to customers in europe  russia  and the middle east 
notably  disposable kit sales to customers in france  southern europe and belgium accounted for a significant portion of the increase in product revenue in from the increase was largely driven by an increase of million in sales of platelet and plasma disposable kits  offset by million decrease in product revenue from uva illuminators 
product revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the increase was largely driven by an increase in the number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold to customers in europe  russia  and the middle east 
we anticipate product revenue for both the platelet and plasma systems will continue to increase in future periods as the intercept blood system gains market acceptance in geographies where commercialization efforts are underway 
historical annual results may not be indicative of intercept blood system revenue in the future 
we recognized million in revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the increase was due primarily to an increase in the activities subject to reimbursement under current awards with the united states department of defense  or dod 
of the total awarded amount during the year ended december  and  the majority of the grant revenue came from reimbursement under a dod award for development activities related to our red blood cell system 
we recognized million in revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease was due primarily to the new dod awards at reduced values for research activities for our intercept red blood cell system 

table of contents cost of product revenue our cost of product revenue consists of the cost of the intercept blood system inventory sold  royalties payable to fenwal for product sales  provisions for obsolete  slow moving and unsaleable product  certain order fulfillment costs  and to the extent applicable  costs for idle facilities 
inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out basis 
years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage cost of product revenue cost of product revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in this increase in the cost of product revenue was due to the larger number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold  increased provisions for obsolete slow moving and scrapped inventory  offset by lower illuminator sales during the year ended december   compared to the number sold during the prior year 
in addition  royalties owed to fenwal increased during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  due to increased sales of both the platelet and plasma systems during the year ended december  furthermore  cost of product revenue increased in compared to due to manufacturing and supply chain costs incurred as a result of the company s decision to curtail manufacturing and optimize inventory levels  leading higher overhead absorption to the inventory units that were manufactured 
similarly  cost of product revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in this increase in the cost of product revenue was primarily due to the larger number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold during the year ended december   compared to the number sold during the year ended december   and the increased royalties owed to fenwal as a result of increased sales of both the platelet and plasma systems during the year ended december  finally  cost of product revenue increased in compared to due to a non cash charge of million for potentially unusable work in progress inventory 
we anticipate that our cost of product revenue will continue to increase in the future as we continue to increase product sales volume 
our realized gross margins on product sales were in  down from in  and down from in the changes in our gross margins are affected by various factors  including manufacturing and supply chain costs  the mix of product sold  and the mix of customers to which product is sold 
generally  we offer our distributors tiered volume discounts of varying magnitudes  depending on their purchase commitments  which depending on sales volumes to those distributors receiving tiered volume discounts  may impact our gross margins 
we expect to maintain inventory levels that will be sufficient to meet forecast demand for a relatively short time period and plan to manufacture at levels above those produced in manufacturing at levels above the levels produced in should result in a lower per unit cost of goods sold when the product is ultimately sold 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for our scientific personnel  non cash stock based compensation  payments to consultants  costs to prepare and conduct preclinical and clinical trials  third party costs for development activities  certain regulatory costs  infrastructure  and laboratory chemicals and supplies 
years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentages research and development 
table of contents research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in this decrease in our research and development expenses was the result of reduced research and development activities driven primarily by our march restructuring plan and the associated reduction in force 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in this decrease in our research and development expenses was the result of reduced development activities regarding our plasma system and lower clinical trial costs associated with our red blood cell system 
we anticipate our research and development spending will continue at approximately the current level and at times may increase as a result of ongoing and later stage clinical trials and development activities 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research and development activities  including but not limited to  the development of the red blood cell system  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval and subsequent launch of our platelet and plasma systems in the united states  and other development activities  including risks and uncertainties that could impact the rate of progress of our development activities  we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures that may ultimately be associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials and other research and development activities 
we face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects  including the risks described in risk factors in part i  item a above 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for administrative personnel  non cash stock based compensation  expenses for our commercialization efforts in europe and elsewhere  expenses for accounting  tax  and internal control  legal and facility related expenses  and insurance premiums 
years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage selling  general and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in overall  this decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased personnel costs and lower marketing and public affairs costs driven primarily by our march restructuring plan and the associated reductions in force 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in overall  this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to expansion of our commercial operations in europe  including increases in personnel costs  and to a lesser extent  increased marketing activities 
of the total selling  general  and administrative expenses incurred  non cash stock based compensation represented million  million  and million for the years ended december    and we anticipate that we will be focused on maintaining our selling  general  and administrative spending around the current levels over the next year  as part of a larger effort to lower operating expenses and conserve cash 

table of contents restructuring restructuring costs during the year ended december   include one time termination benefits  facility consolidation and related moving costs 
years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage restructuring in march  pursuant to the board of directors approval  we began implementing a plan to focus resources on commercializing the intercept blood system in europe  to consolidate facilities  and to reduce our cost structure 
during the year ended december   we incurred costs for one time termination benefits for employee positions that were eliminated under the restructuring plan 
during the year ended december   we also incurred costs associated with consolidating facilities and certain other costs associated with the restructuring plan 
most costs accrued as one time termination benefits as of march  were paid by december  the balance of million left at december  will be paid over an extended period of time  into as a result of the restructuring  cerus expects that annualized operating expenses may be reduced by about million compared to operating expenses in loss from long term investment in related parties  net during the year ended december   we owned certain equity interests in two companies  bioone corporation and anza therapeutics  both accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
during  we recorded the following gains and losses on these investments

in exchange for agreeing to the transfer and for relinquishing our shares in anza and releasing any claims against anza  we received million in cash 
as such  a gain of million was recognized 
we also recorded an impairment to the carrying value on our investment in bioone of million 
the charge was taken as a result of our evaluation of the factors used to support our position in bioone and the company determined that the investment was not recoverable 
gain on operating settlement years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage gain on operating agreement settlement during the fourth quarter of  we and baxter resolved several outstanding issues and disputes resulting from the transition services agreement and manufacturing agreement 
as an outcome of those negotiations  on december   we and baxter entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement or the 
table of contents mrsa 
the mrsa called for the complete and permanent waiver and release of any and all claims we or baxter had on any amounts generated under the transition services agreement 
as a result of entering into the mrsa  we eliminated approximately million in payment obligations to baxter and million in receivables due from baxter which were generated under the agreements and recorded on our balance sheet 
the mrsa required us to pay million to baxter for the settlement 
as such  we recorded a million gain during the year ended december   and a million obligation on our december  balance sheet 
we paid the million payment in satisfaction of the mrsa on january  interest income expense and other  net interest income expense and other  net consists of interest earned from our short term investment portfolio  foreign exchange gain loss  and other non operating gains and losses 
years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage interest income expense and other  net interest income expense and other  net  was a net expense of million for the year ended december   compared to million in income during the comparable period in this decrease in income was primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower cash and short term investment balances and lower yields on those balances and foreign currency exchange rate differences between the united states dollar and the euro  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  interest income and other  net  was million for the year ended december   compared to million in income during the comparable period in this decrease in income was primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower cash and short term investment balances and lower yields on those balances and foreign currency exchange rate differences between the united states dollar and the euro  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  in addition  during the year ended december   we recorded other than temporary impairments totaling million to our investment portfolio as a result of market deterioration due to the tightening global credit crisis 
we expect to earn interest income at market rates in proportion to the marketable securities balances we maintain 
we generally hold such investments until such time as we liquidate them to meet an operating cash need 
interest paid on our investment portfolio may decrease and the value of certain securities we hold may decline  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
in august  we completed a public offering of our common stock  netting proceeds of approximately million 
we invested these proceeds in marketable securities pursuant to our investment policy  and generally hold such investments until such time as we liquidate them to meet an operating cash need 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  our sources of capital to date have primarily consisted of public offerings and private placements of equity securities  payments received under our agreements with bioone  united states government grants and cooperative agreements  and  contribution from product sales net of expenses and interest income 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to higher revenues and lower operating expenses  coupled with changes in our operating assets and liabilities  notably inventory which we sold down in  as well as higher accrued expenses 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december   was million compared to million during the comparable period in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to changes in 
table of contents our operating assets and liabilities  notably decreases in our accrued expenses and increases in our inventory balances  offset by decreases in our accounts receivable balances 
net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december   was million compared to million during the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to fewer maturities of short term investments in compared to net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december   was million compared to million during the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to fewer purchases of short term investments in  offset by the sales and maturities of short term investments 
the cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to cash received from net proceeds raised from our registered direct public offering of common stock and warrants  while cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to cash received from the exercise of stock options 
working capital decreased to million at december   from million and million at december  and  respectively primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and partially offset by increased accounts receivable and inventory balances  net of accounts payable balances 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials of our red blood cell system  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we expect to prioritize continued commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in europe  russia  the middle east and in selected countries in other regions around the world  over the pursuit of regulatory approval of the platelet system in the united states and development and commercialization of the red blood cell system 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval and subsequent launch of our platelet and plasma systems in the united states  and the development of the red blood cell system and other development activities  including risks and uncertainties that could impact the rate of progress of our development activities  we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures that may ultimately be associated with our anticipated clinical trials and other research and development activities 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth on terms that may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
all of our authorized common stock have been either issued or reserved for issuance in connection with convertible preferred stock  warrants  our employee stock purchase plan  and our equity incentive plan 
accordingly  in order to have shares available for future sale  we and our stockholders will need to approve an authorization to increase the number of shares that are issuable under our certificate of incorporation and we cannot guarantee that our stockholders would approve such an increase 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or product  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
the credit markets and the financial services industry continued to experience turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on terms reasonable to us or our stockholders 

table of contents historically  we had received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the dod for the intercept blood system 
further funding awarded under federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood systems may decline when compared to historic levels 
any such funding is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the united states congress 
the general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount of government funding 
if we are unable to obtain federal grant and cooperative agreement funding for the continued development of the intercept system in the united states at levels similar to past funding  we may need to reduce our operating expenses  which would delay progress in some of our development programs 
in late october we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to offer and sell up to million of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  and or debt securities 
this shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec in december in august  we completed a registered direct offering under our shelf registration  netting proceeds of approximately million 
we will not be able to issue common stock under this shelf registration statement until we and our stockholders approve an increase to the number of authorized shares that are issuable under our certificate of incorporation 
commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments our commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period from december  total less than year years years after years contractual obligations minimum purchase requirements operating leases other commitments total contractual cash obligations minimum purchase requirements our minimum purchase commitments include certain components of our intercept blood safety system that we purchase from third party manufacturers and supply to fenway for use in manufacturing finished disposable kits 
operating leases we generally lease our office facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year that require us to pay operating costs  property taxes  insurance and maintenance 
these facility leases generally contain renewal options and provisions adjusting the lease payments if those renewal options are exercised 
on december  we exercised a ten year extension option to extend the term of our lease relating to stanwell drive in concord  california 
by exercising this extension option  our lease payments for that building will be increased 
our facility leases qualify as operating leases under fasb asc topic  leases and as such  are not included on our balance sheet 
other commitments our other commitments consist of financing obligations for payment of certain insurance premiums which expire in in addition  we financed certain of our leasehold buildouts relating to our amersfoort office 

table of contents under the terms of the financing arrangement  we are obligated to pay for these leasehold buildouts on a monthly basis through the remaining lease term 
royalties we are obligated to pay royalties on certain intercept product sales based on a percentage of net sales generated 
the royalty rates vary by product  with rates of of net sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system  for the red blood cell system  and for uva illuminators 
as future product sales cannot be estimated  this royalty obligation is not included in the table above 
financial instruments we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk of our cash  cash equivalent  and short term investments balance of million at december   approximately had original maturity dates of less than days  and the remaining had original maturities more than one year 
we do not believe our exposure to interest rate risk to be material given the short term nature of our investment portfolio and the relatively flat yields in high credit  fixed income investments and the consistent yields we have experienced and anticipate experiencing across our portfolio  regardless of maturity date 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and limit duration by restricting the term for single securities and for the portfolio as a whole 
our investments are held and managed by a third party capital management adviser that in turn  utilizes a combination of active market quotes and where necessary  proprietary pricing models as well as a subscribed pricing service  in order to estimate fair value
