overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drugs used in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders  which are those affecting the digestive tract 
our strategy is to identify and acquire rights to products that we believe have potential for near term regulatory approval or are already approved  apply our regulatory  product development  and sales and marketing expertise to commercialize these products  and use our approximately member specialty sales and marketing team focused on high prescribing us gastroenterologists  who are doctors who specialize in gastrointestinal disorders  to sell our products 
our current products demonstrate our ability to execute this strategy 
as of december   our products were xifaxan rifaximin tablets mg  moviprep peg  sodium sulfate  sodium chloride  potassium chloride  sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid for oral solution  osmoprep sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate  usp and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous  usp tablets  visicol sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate  usp  and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous  usp tablets  apriso mesalamine extended release capsules g  metozolv odt metoclopramide hcl mg and mg orally disintegrating tablets  and azasan azathioprine tablets  usp  mg  anusol hc hydrocortisone cream  usp  anusol hc mg suppository hydrocortisone acetate  proctocort cream hydrocortisone cream  usp and proctocort suppository hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories mg

we generate revenue primarily by selling our products  namely prescription drugs  to pharmaceutical wholesalers 
these direct customers resell and distribute our products to and through pharmacies to patients who have had our products prescribed by doctors 
we currently market our products  and intend to market future products  if approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to us gastroenterologists and other physicians through our own direct sales force 
in december  we established our own field sales force to market colazal in the united states 
currently  this sales force has approximately sales representatives in the field and markets our approved products 
although the creation of an independent sales organization involved substantial costs  we believe that the financial returns from our direct product sales have been and will continue to be more favorable to us than those from the indirect sale of products through marketing partners 
we enter into distribution or licensing relationships outside the united states and in certain markets in the us where a larger sales organization is appropriate 
currently  our sales and marketing staff  including our sales representatives  consists of approximately people 
because demand for our products originates with doctors  our sales force calls on high prescribing specialists  primarily gastroenterologists  and we monitor new and total prescriptions for our products as key performance indicators for our business 
prescriptions result in our products being used by patients  requiring our direct customers to purchase more products to replenish their inventory 
however  our revenue might fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to other factors  such as increased buying by wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase or because of the introduction of new products 
revenue could be less than anticipated in subsequent quarters as wholesalers increased inventory is used up 
our primary product candidates currently under development and their status are as follows compound indication status rifaximin hepatic encephalopathy  or he new drug application  or nda  submitted june   prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  action date march  rifaximin irritable bowel syndrome  or ibs phase iii crofelemer hiv associated diarrhea phase iii balsalazide disodium tablet ulcerative colitis complete response letter submitted to the fda october   pdufa action date april  budesonide foam ulcerative proctitis phase iii products xifaxan rifaximin tablets xifaxan is a gastrointestinal specific oral antibiotic that the fda approved in may for the treatment of patients years of age and older with travelers diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of e coli 
according to the centers for disease control  each year between and of international travelers  an estimated million people  develop diarrhea  with approximately of the cases caused by bacteria 
approximately million people sought treatment in the united states for infectious diarrhea in and approximately million of those patients were prescribed a drug 

table of contents we believe the advantages of xifaxan to treat these infections are two fold site targeted antibiotic delivery  and improved tolerability compared to other treatments 
less than of the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream when it is taken orally 
in addition  the drug might also cause fewer side effects or discomforts such as nausea  headache or dizziness than observed with currently available  more highly absorbed antibiotics 
we believe xifaxan is also less likely to cause harmful interaction with other drugs a patient may be taking 
we believe xifaxan is unique because there is no other us approved oral antibiotic with its potential lack of systemic absorption and safety profile 
we launched xifaxan in the united states in july using our own direct sales force 
we are exploring potential additional indications  formulations  clinical trials and co promotion arrangements to capitalize on the potential for xifaxan  including our development programs in hepatic encephalopathy  irritable bowel syndrome and prevention of travelers diarrhea 
based on these potential indications  we believe xifaxan can potentially compete in an annual us market in excess of approximately billion  comprised of over million patient visits 
while the potential market for xifaxan is large  we expect to capture only a portion of each market due to competition  ability to capture share in each market  market acceptance and or other factors

table of contents sales and marketing we currently market our products and intend  if approved by the fda  to market future products to us gastroenterologists through our own direct sales force 
we enter into distribution relationships outside the united states and in markets where a larger sales organization is appropriate 
currently  our sales and marketing staff consists of approximately people  which we believe should also position us to sell additional products  if and when acquired and or approved for us marketing 
because there are a relatively small number of gastroenterologists that write a majority of the prescriptions in our indications  we believe that the size of our sales force is appropriate to reach our target physicians 
our sales force consists of approximately employees who regularly call on approximately  healthcare professionals 
we also have approximately ten national account managers who regularly call on major drug wholesalers  managed care organizations  large retail chains  formularies and related organizations 
we believe we have created an attractive incentive program for our sales force that is based upon goals in prescription growth  market share achievement and customer service 
we cultivate relationships of trust and confidence with the high prescribing gastroenterologists in the united states 
we use a variety of marketing techniques to promote our products including sampling  journal advertising  promotional materials  specialty publications  coupons  money back or product replacement guarantees  educational conferences and informational websites

the budesonide rectal foam product has patent coverage in the us until the patents for the balsalazide composition of matter and method of treating ulcerative colitis with balsalazide expired in july in the united states  however  we were granted five years of new chemical entity data exclusivity for balsalazide until july and an extension of such patent under the waxman hatch act through july we also obtained patent extensions for the composition of balsalazide in italy and the united kingdom until july we have filed applications for patents relating to additional indications using balsalazide and related chemical substances

 which also provides protection until november data exclusivity rifaximin was a new chemical entity  therefore  the fda granted us five year new chemical entity exclusivity when it was approved in may therefore  rifaximin had data exclusivity through may apriso  the granulated mesalamine product  is not a new chemical entity  but is entitled to three years of exclusivity from its approval based on the new clinical investigations that have been required during the approval process 
the exclusivity prevents the fda from approving an anda for a granulated mesalamine product which relied upon the new clinical investigation in our nda for three years from october  the patent for the granulated mesalamine protects the product until april 
table of contents metoclopramide  which is not a new chemical entity  was not entitled to three years of data exclusivity from the date of its approval 
our metoclopramide product is a fast dissolve formulation that has patent protection until and additional patent protection pending that  if issued  will provide intellectual property protection until azasan and the anusol hc and proctocort product lines are mature products  thus  there are no available patent or exclusivity rights 
the pepcid product line is a mature product line  thus  there are no available patent or exclusivity rights 
crofelemer  which is a new chemical entity  should be eligible for market exclusivity for five years in the united states 
as a new molecular entity  we believe crofelemer may be entitled to patent term restoration 
the patents for crofelemer provide protection until government regulation the research  testing  manufacture  marketing and distribution of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  storage  record keeping  labeling  promotion and marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject a company to administrative sanctions or judicially imposed sanctions such as civil penalties  criminal prosecution  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls  and total or partial suspension of product marketing and or approvals 
in addition  non compliance may result in the fda s refusal to approve pending ndas or supplements to approved ndas or in the withdrawal of an nda 
any such sanction could result in adverse publicity  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions  and results of operation 
the steps ordinarily required before a new pharmaceutical product containing a new chemical entity may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals and formulation studies  the submission to the fda of a notice of claimed investigational exemption for a new drug  which must become effective before clinical testing may commence  adequate and well controlled clinical human trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  the submission of an nda to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation  as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product 
preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations 
the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an ind 
a day waiting period after the filing of each ind is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans 
in addition  the fda may  at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  impose a clinical hold on proposed or ongoing clinical trials 
if the fda imposes a clinical hold  clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without fda authorization and then only under terms authorized by the fda 
in some instances  the ind application process can result in substantial delay and expense 
clinical trials to support ndas are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess metabolism  pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions and safety  including side effects associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  phase iii trials are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
there can be no assurance that phase i  phase ii or phase iii testing will be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all  with respect to any of our products subject to such testing 

table of contents after successful completion of the required clinical testing  generally an nda is submitted 
fda approval of the nda is required before marketing may begin in the united states 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an nda for filing 
in such an event  the nda must be resubmitted with the additional information and  again  is subject to review before filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the nda 
the fda generally has months in which to review the nda and respond to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission 
in the last few years  fda review times have lengthened 
the fda may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
if the fda s evaluation of the nda submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda may refuse to approve the nda or issue a not approvable letter  outlining the deficiencies in the submission and often requiring additional testing or information 
if fda evaluations of the nda and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an complete response letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda 
when and if those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
furthermore  approval may entail ongoing requirements for post marketing studies  and marketed products  manufacturers and manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
in addition  identification of certain side effects after a drug is on the market or the occurrence of manufacturing problems could cause subsequent withdrawal of approval  reformulation of the drug  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials and changes in labeling of the product 
under the orphan drug act  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than  individuals in the united states or a disease whose incidence rates number more than  where the sponsor establishes that it does not realistically anticipate that its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs 
the sponsor that obtains the first marketing approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease is eligible to receive marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the orphan indication for a period of seven years 
rifaximin for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and colazal for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients between to years of age have been granted orphan drug status 
regulation of drug compounds outside of the united states outside the united states  the ability to market a drug is contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
currently  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although within the european union procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
if and when necessary  we will choose the appropriate route of european regulatory filing to accomplish the most rapid regulatory approvals 
however  the chosen regulatory strategy might not secure regulatory approvals or approvals of our chosen product indications 
furthermore  we must obtain pricing approval in addition to regulatory approval prior to launching the product in the approving country 
failure to obtain pricing approval in a timely manner or approval of pricing which would support an adequate return on investment or generate a sufficient margin to justify the economic risk might delay or prohibit the commercial launch of the product in those countries 
competition competition in our business is intense and characterized by extensive research efforts  rapid technological progress and an increasing rate of generic product approvals 
technological developments by competitors  earlier regulatory approval for marketing competitive products  including generic versions of our products  such as those launched against colazal in december and those that novel laboratories is seeking to launch against moviprep and osmoprep  or superior marketing capabilities possessed by competitors could adversely affect the commercial potential of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 
we believe 
table of contents that there are numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including large well known pharmaceutical companies and generic manufacturers  as well as academic research groups throughout the world  engaged in research and development efforts with respect to pharmaceutical products targeted at gastrointestinal diseases and conditions addressed by our current and potential products 
in particular  we are aware of products in research or development by competitors that address the diseases being targeted by our products 
developments by others might render our current and potential products obsolete or non competitive 
competitors might be able to complete the development and regulatory approval process sooner and  therefore  market their products earlier than us 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and personnel resources and development capabilities than we do 
for example  many large  well capitalized companies already offer products in the united states and europe that target the indications for balsalazide and our mesalamine extended release capsule product  including mesalamine glaxosmithkline plc  giuliani spa  axcan pharma  inc  solvay sa  warner chilcott plc and shire pharmaceuticals group plc  sulfasalazine pharmacia upjohn  inc  and olsalazine alaven pharmaceutical llc 
asacol  marketed by warner chilcott  is currently the most prescribed product for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in the united states  and shire introduced once a day lialda in in addition  on december   the office of generic drugs approved three generic balsalazide capsule products 
several prescription liquid peg products compete with visicol  osmoprep and moviprep in the bowel cleansing market 
these prescription products include colyte  golytely  halflytely  and nulytely braintree and trilyte alaven pharmaceutical llc 
generic prescription  liquid peg products are also available 
the most frequently prescribed product for treatment of travelers diarrhea in the united states currently is ciprofloxacin  commonly known as cipro and marketed by bayer ag 
the most frequently prescribed products that compete with azasan are imuran  marketed by prometheus laboratories  inc  and its various generics and purinethol  marketed by gate pharmaceuticals  and it s various generics 
the most frequently prescribed products that compete with anusol hc and proctocort are anamantle hc  marketed by nycomed  analpram hc  marketed by ferndale laboratories  proctofoam hc and proctocream hc  marketed by alaven pharmaceutical llc  procto kit  marketed by ranbaxy pharmaceuticals  and various generics 
the most frequently prescribed products that compete with metozolv are reglan  marketed by alaven pharmaceuticals llc  and various generics 
employees as of december   we had approximately full time employees 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract  hire  and retain qualified personnel  including sales and marketing personnel in particular 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  attract  and retain such personnel in the future 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good

risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference 
if any of the following risks  or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant  develop into actual events  then our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 
if that happens  the market price of our common stock could decline  and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment 
future sales of xifaxan and our other marketed products might be less than expected 
we currently market and sell twelve primary products  with a majority of our historical revenue derived from sales of colazal prior to we expect xifaxan  which was launched in mid  and moviprep  which we 
table of contents acquired from norgine in december  to be growing and significant sources of revenue in the future 
if sales of our marketed products decline or if we experience product returns significantly in excess of estimated amounts recorded  particularly with respect to xifaxan and moviprep  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the degree of market acceptance of our products among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community will depend upon a number of factors including the timing of regulatory approvals and product launches by us or competitors  and including any generic or over the counter competitors  such as those being pursued by novel laboratories with respect to moviprep and osmoprep  perceptions by physicians and other members of the healthcare community regarding the safety and efficacy of the products  price increases  and the price of our products relative to other drugs or competing treatments  patient and physician demand  adverse side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our products or other drugs in our class  the results of product development efforts for new indications  the scope and timing of additional marketing approvals and favorable reimbursement programs for expanded uses  availability of sufficient commercial quantities of the products  and our success in getting other companies to distribute our products outside of the us gastroenterology market 
we expect to approach profitability and have positive cash flow during  assuming we receive fda approval for rifaximin in hepatic encephalopathy  but we might need additional capital 
we expect to approach profitability and have positive cash flow during  assuming we receive fda approval for rifaximin in hepatic encephalopathy 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from the sale of our products will be sufficient to fund our operations for  but that might not be the case 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the status of competitive products  including current and potential generics  the results  costs and timing of our research and development activities  regulatory approvals and product launches  the number of products we acquire or in license  any impact on us of current conditions and uncertainties in the economy generally and the financial markets  patient and physician demand for our products  our ability to reduce our costs in the event product demand is less than expected  or regulatory approvals are delayed or more expensive than expected  and our ability to maintain our current credit facility 
if we need additional capital  we might seek additional debt or equity financing or both to fund our operations or acquisitions 
if we incur more debt  we might be restricted in our ability to raise additional capital and might be subject to financial and restrictive covenants 
if we issued additional equity  our stockholders could suffer dilution 
we might also enter into additional collaborative arrangements that could provide us with additional funding in the form of equity  debt  licensing  milestone and or royalty payments 
we might not be able to enter into such arrangements or raise any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all  especially in the current economic environment 
our common stock is likely to decrease in value if the market believes that we will be unable to return to profitability  or that we will be required to raise additional capital 

table of contents our credit facility  as amended  contains various representations  warranties and affirmative  negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type 
for example  as long as we maintain an amount equal to the amount outstanding under the credit facility on deposit with the administrative agent of the credit facility and maintain a minimum of million in cash on our balance sheet  the leverage test and fixed charge test are suspended under the credit facility 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the credit facility  as amended  at december  if we fall out of compliance with the financial covenants in the future  we would need to obtain a waiver or amendment  or the amount outstanding on the credit facility would be immediately due 
regulatory approval of our product candidates is time consuming  expensive and uncertain  and could result in unexpectedly high expenses and delay our ability to sell our products 
development of our products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this regulation could require us to incur significant unexpected expenses or delay or limit our ability to sell our product candidates  including specifically rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy  or he  and for irritable bowel syndrome  or ibs 
in the fda accepted our nda for rifaximin in he and gave us an action date of december  in november  the fda informed us that they were extending the action date by three months to provide time for a full review 
the extended pdufa action date is march  although on february   the gastrointestinal drugs advisory committee of the fda recommended by a vote of to in favor of the approval of rifaximin mg dosed twice a day  for the maintenance of remission of hepatic encephalopathy  the fda is not required to follow this recommendation 
in early  the fda announced that because of its large workload it might not meet its target dates to respond to nda submissions  and in november it extended the metoclopramide zydis review until february in addition  in we received two approvable or complete response letters from the fda for balsalazide tablets and wilmington pharmaceuticals received one in february for metoclopramide  each requesting additional information or further studies  rather than regulatory approval 
our clinical studies might be delayed or halted  or additional studies might be required  for various reasons  including the drug is not effective  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  appropriate patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate expected  as has been the case with our xifaxan phase iii trial in thailand for the prevention of travelers diarrhea  drug supplies are not sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  or we decide to modify the drug during testing 
if regulatory approval of any product is granted  it will be limited to those indications for which the product has been shown to be safe and effective  as demonstrated to the fda s satisfaction through clinical studies 
for example  rifaximin has been approved for treatment of travelers diarrhea  but we are developing rifaximin for he  ibs and other indications 
the fda may never approve any of our compounds in the indications we are pursuing  which would mean we cannot market these compounds for use in these indications 
our ability to increase revenue in the future will depend in part on our success in in licensing or acquiring additional pharmaceutical products 
we currently intend to in license or acquire additional pharmaceutical products  as we did with crofelemer and budesonide  that have been developed beyond the initial discovery phase and for which late stage human clinical data is already available  or as we did with pepcid oral suspension  that has already received regulatory approval 
these kinds of pharmaceutical products might not be available to us on attractive terms or at all 
to the extent we acquire rights to additional products  we might incur significant additional expense in connection with the development and  if approved by the fda  marketing of these products 

table of contents regulatory approval  even if granted  might entail ongoing requirements or restrictions on marketing that could increase our expenses and limit revenue 
approval might entail ongoing requirements for post marketing studies  or limit how or to whom we can sell our products 
even if regulatory approval is obtained  labeling and promotional activities are subject to continual scrutiny by the fda and state regulatory agencies and  in some circumstances  the federal trade commission 
for example  in the fda required us to put a black box warning on the osmoprep and visicol labels regarding potential kidney damage that could result from their use  and a black box warning for metozolv regarding tardive dyskensia which could result from its use 
these warnings could limit future sales of those products 
in addition  fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved products for unapproved  or off label  uses 
these regulations and the fda s interpretation of them might increase our expenses  impair our ability to effectively market our products  and limit our revenue 
our intellectual property rights might not afford us with meaningful protection 
the intellectual property rights protecting our products might not afford us with meaningful protection from generic and other competition 
in addition  because our strategy is to in license or acquire pharmaceutical products which typically have been discovered and initially researched by others  future products might have limited or no remaining patent protection due to the time elapsed since their discovery 
competitors could also design around any of our intellectual property or otherwise design competitive products that do not infringe our intellectual property 
any litigation that we become involved in to enforce intellectual property rights could result in substantial cost to us 
in addition  claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could be costly 
our patent or other proprietary rights related to our products might conflict with the current or future intellectual property rights of others 
litigation or patent interference proceedings  either of which could result in substantial cost to us  might be necessary to defend any patents to which we have rights and our other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
the defense of patent and intellectual property claims is both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable 
any adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties  or require us to cease selling one or more of our products 
we might not be able to obtain a license to any third party technology that we require to conduct our business  or  if obtainable  that technology might not be available at a reasonable cost 
upon patent expiration  our drugs could be subject to generic competition  which could negatively affect our pricing and sales volume 
as previously disclosed  this has already happened to colazal  which had been our largest selling drug prior to patent applications relating to rifaximin compositions and related chemical substances were filed together with alfa wasserman and issued in may this patent extends patent coverage to and in a related patent  us patent no 
 issued to provide further coverage of rifaximin 
in november of and in october  the united states patent and trademark office issued a patent covering the use of rifaximin for treating irritable bowel syndrome ibs and bloating caused by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth  respectively 
in january  the united states patent and trademark office issued a patent covering composition of matter and kit claims for moviprep 
the moviprep patent provides coverage to september the patent for visicol and osmoprep will expire in additional patent protection is being sought for osmoprep that  if approved  will provide patent coverage to the patent for the treatment of the intestinal tract with the apriso will provide patent coverage to in june  us patent no 
 issued  which relates to methods of producing apriso and provides further protection 
the patent application relating to the dosage form for metoclopramide protects the product until july the patent for crofelemer  relating to enteric formulations and uses thereof provide protection until and should be entitled to patent term restoration as a new molecular entity 
there is no assurance that these patents or the patent term restorations will be issued or granted  respectively 
patent expiration dates listed herein  unless otherwise noted  are for us patents and assume there are no patent term adjustments  extensions or other adverse events that could affect the term or scope of a patent 
dates provided herein for the expiration of patent applications are merely estimates based on knowledge at this time and could be altered  for example  by terminal disclaimer or if patent term extensions or adjustments are available 

table of contents rifaximin is a new chemical entity and was granted five year new chemical entity exclusivity by the fda when it was approved in may rifaximin  therefore  had data exclusivity until may accordingly  the office of generic drugs would have been able to accept an anda for xifaxan tablets on or any time subsequent to may  if the applicant made certifications of patent non infringement or invalidity 
if this occurred  a paragraph iv notification would have to be provided to us by the applicant 
although we do not possess any specific knowledge of any such filing at the current time  the expiration of data exclusivity could result in a challenge to the related intellectual property rights of xifaxan mg tablets at any time in the future 
in may we submitted a citizen petition  requesting the director of the office of generic drugs of the food and drug administration impose scientifically appropriate standards for the demonstration of bioequivalence for abbreviated new drug applications citing xifaxan as the reference listed drug 
because azasan  anusol hc  pepcid and proctocort are mature products  there are no patents or data exclusivity rights available which subjects us to greater risk of generic competition for those products 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances  which we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with collaborative partners  employees and consultants 
these agreements might be breached and we might not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets and proprietary know how might otherwise become known or be independently developed by others 
intense competition might render our products noncompetitive or obsolete 
competition in our business is intense and characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
technological developments by competitors  regulatory approval for marketing competitive products  including potential generic or over the counter products  or superior marketing resources possessed by competitors could adversely affect the commercial potential of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 
we believe that there are numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including large well known pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic research groups throughout the world  engaged in research and development efforts with respect to pharmaceutical products targeted at gastrointestinal diseases and conditions addressed by our current and potential products 
in particular  we are aware of products in research or development by competitors that address the diseases being targeted by our products 
developments by others might render our current and potential products obsolete or noncompetitive 
competitors might be able to complete the development and regulatory approval process sooner and  therefore  market their products earlier than we can 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and personnel resources and development capabilities than we do 
for example  many large  well capitalized companies already offer products in the united states and europe that target the indications for xifaxan as approved travelers diarrhea  including ciprofloxacin  commonly known as cipro bayer ag  visicol  osmoprep and moviprep  including colyte  golytely  halflytely  and nulytely braintree and trilyte alaven pharmaceutical llc  as well as potential generics from novel laboratories or others  apriso  including asacol warner chilcott  sulfasalazine pfizer  dipentum alaven pharmaceutical llc  pentasa shire pharmaceuticals group  plc  once a day lialda shire  and three generic balsalazide capsule products  xifaxan under development  including lotronex prometheus  and zelnorm novartis  which is no longer available on the market in the us  for ibs  and metozolv odt  including reglan alaven pharmaceutical llc  and various generics 
in addition  other products are in research or development by competitors that address the diseases and diagnostic procedures being targeted by these and our other products 

table of contents we could be exposed to significant product liability claims that could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
we have been in the past and might continue to be subjected to product liability claims that arise through the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of our products 
for example  we are currently and might continue to be subject to a number of product liability claims relating to osmoprep and visicol in connection with their box label warning 
we intend to defend these claims vigorously but we are currently unable to predict the outcome or to reasonably estimate the range of potential expenses or loss  if any 
we currently maintain liability coverage for both clinical trials and the commercialization of our products but it is possible that this coverage  and any future coverage  will be insufficient to satisfy any liabilities that arise 
we would have to assume defense of the lawsuits and be responsible for damages  fees and expenses  if any  that are awarded against us or for amounts in excess of our product liability coverage 
these claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
in the future  we might not be able to obtain adequate coverage at an acceptable cost or might be unable to obtain adequate coverage at all 
if healthcare reform is passed or third party payors do not provide coverage or reimburse patients for our products  our ability to derive revenues might suffer 
our success will depend in part on the extent to which government and health administration authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors will pay for our products 
reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products is uncertain 
in the united states and elsewhere  third party payors  such as medicaid  are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products 
in the united states  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the healthcare system have been proposed in recent years  and the obama administration and democrats in congress have indicated they would like to address this 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to increase pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
while we cannot predict whether legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or what effect those proposals or managed care efforts  including those relating to medicaid payments  might have on our business  the announcement and or adoption of such proposals or efforts could increase costs and reduce or eliminate profit margins 
third party insurance coverage might not be available to patients for our products 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products  the market acceptance of these products might be reduced 
we are dependent on third parties to supply us with products 
we rely entirely on third parties to supply us with our commercially marketed products and our products under development 
for example  glenmark pharmaceuticals  ltd  a corporation organized and located in india  manufactures and supplies us with drug substance for crofelemer  an anti secretory agent that we are developing for the treatment of hiv associated diarrhea 
the raw material used in production of the crofelemer drug substance grows in select countries in south america 
the amount of resources glenmark devotes to these activities and its ability to successfully obtain raw material is not within our control 
failure by glenmark to manufacture and supply us with crofelemer drug substance  whether due to international  political or economic conditions or otherwise  could delay development  increase expenses  delay regulatory approval  or eventually prevent us from generating revenue from crofelemer  if approved  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
likewise  interruption of supply of any of our other products  whether for clinical use or commercial use  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products 
we own no manufacturing facilities  and we have limited capabilities in manufacturing pharmaceutical products 
we do not generally expect to engage directly in the manufacturing of products  but instead contract with third party vendors for these services 
a limited number of contract manufacturers exist which are capable of manufacturing our 
table of contents marketed products and our product candidates 
we might fail to contract with the necessary manufacturers or might contract with manufacturers on terms that may not be entirely acceptable to us 
given our ongoing dependence on third party vendors for supply of material for use in clinical trials and for commercial product  our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacture of products might be difficult to scale up when required and result in delays  inefficiencies and poor or low yields of quality products  some of our contracts contain purchase commitments that require us to make minimum purchases that might exceed our needs or limit our ability to negotiate with other manufacturers  which might increase costs  the cost of manufacturing certain products might make them prohibitively expensive  delays in scale up to commercial quantities and any change in manufacturers could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products  manufacturers are subject to the fda s cgmp regulations and similar foreign standards  and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by the third party manufacturers  if we need to change manufacturers  transfers of technical expertise would be required which would include educating the new manufacturer in the processes necessary for the production of our products  which may not be successful  and if we need to change manufacturers  fda and comparable foreign regulators may require additional testing and compliance inspections prior to the new manufacturer being qualified for the production of our products 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulation could harm us financially and could hurt our reputation 
we and our third party manufacturers  such as glenmark pharmaceuticals  ltd 
that produces crofelemer drug substance  are also required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations which include requirements relating to manufacturing  packaging  documentation  quality control  and quality assurance 
further  manufacturing facilities must be approved by the fda before they can be used to manufacture our products 
such facilities are subject to periodic fda inspection 
manufacturing regulations can increase our expenses and delay production  either of which could reduce our margins 
in addition  if we fail to comply with any of fda s continuing regulations  we could be subject to reputational harm and sanctions  including delays  warning letters and fines  product recalls or seizures and injunctions on sales  refusal of the fda to review pending applications  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
in addition  the occurrence of manufacturing related compliance issues could cause subsequent withdrawal of the drug approval  reformulation of the drug product  additional testing or changes in labeling of the finished product 
our results of operations might fluctuate from period to period  and a failure to meet the expectations of investors or the financial community at large could result in a decline in our stock price 
our results of operations might fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis due to  among other factors the timing of regulatory approvals and product launches by us or competitors  including potential generic or over the counter competitors  the level of revenue generated by commercialized products  including potential increased purchases of inventory by wholesalers in anticipation of potential price increases or introductions of new dosages or bottle sizes  and subsequent lower than expected revenue as the inventory is used  
table of contents the timing of any up front payments that might be required in connection with any future acquisition of product rights  the timing of milestone payments that might be required to our current or future licensors  fluctuations in our development and other costs in connection with ongoing product development programs  the level of marketing and other expenses required in connection with product launches and ongoing product growth  the timing of the acquisition and integration of businesses  assets  products and technologies  and general and industry specific business and economic conditions 
our stock price is volatile 
our stock price has been extremely volatile and might continue to be  making owning our stock risky 
between january  and march   the price of a share of our common stock varied from a low of to a high of 
in  there have been five days on which our stock price increased or decreased by or more 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the performance of particular companies  including as a result of the current credit and economic crisis 
in addition  the market prices of the common stock of many publicly traded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have in the past been and can in the future be expected to be especially volatile 
announcements of prescription trends  technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  generic approvals  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or our competitors  regulatory developments in both the united states and other countries  public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical products  and economic and other external factors  as well as period to period fluctuations in financial results  might have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
antitakeover provisions could discourage a takeover that stockholders consider to be in their best interests or prevent the removal of our current directors and management 
we have adopted a number of provisions that could have antitakeover effects or prevent the removal of our current directors and management 
we have adopted a stockholder protection rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
the rights plan is intended to deter an attempt to acquire us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights plan will not prevent an acquisition that is approved by our board of directors 
we believe our rights plan assisted in our successful defense against a hostile takeover bid earlier in our charter authorizes our board of directors to determine the terms of up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and issue them without stockholder approval 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from acquiring  voting control in order to remove our current directors and management 
our bylaws also eliminate the ability of the stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting or make proposals at stockholder meetings without giving us advance written notice  which could hinder the ability of stockholders to quickly take action that might be opposed by management 
these provisions could make more difficult the removal of current directors and management or a takeover of salix  even if these events could be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drugs used in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders  which are those affecting the digestive tract 
our strategy is to identify and acquire rights to products that we believe have potential for near term regulatory approval or are already approved  apply our regulatory  product development  and sales and marketing expertise to commercialize these products  and use our approximately member specialty sales and marketing team focused on high prescribing us gastroenterologists  who are doctors who specialize in gastrointestinal disorders  to sell our products 
our current products demonstrate our ability to execute this strategy 
as of december   our products were xifaxan rifaximin tablets mg  moviprep peg  sodium sulfate  sodium chloride  potassium chloride  sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid for oral solution  osmoprep sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate  usp and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous  usp tablets  visicol sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate  usp  and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous  usp tablets  azasan azathioprine tablets  usp  mg  anusol hc hydrocortisone cream  usp  anusol hc mg suppository hydrocortisone acetate  proctocort cream hydrocortisone cream  usp and proctocort suppository hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories mg  pepcid famotidine for oral suspension  oral suspension diuril chlorothiazide  apriso mesalamine extended release capsules g  metozolv odt metoclopramide hcl mg and mg orally disintegrating tablets  which we began selling in the fourth quarter of  and colazal balsalazide disodium capsules mg 
we generate revenue primarily by selling our products  namely prescription drugs  to pharmaceutical wholesalers 
these direct customers resell and distribute our products to and through pharmacies to patients who have had our products prescribed by doctors 
we currently market our products  and intend to market future products  if approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to us gastroenterologists and other physicians through our own direct sales force 
in december  we established our own field sales force to market colazal in the united states 
currently  this sales force has approximately sales representatives in the field and markets our approved products 
although the creation of an independent sales organization involved substantial costs  we believe that the financial returns from our direct product sales have been and will continue to be more favorable to us than those from the indirect sale of products through marketing partners 
we enter into distribution or licensing relationships outside the united states and in certain markets in the us where a larger sales organization is appropriate 
currently  our sales and marketing staff  including our sales representatives  consists of approximately people 

table of contents because demand for our products originates with doctors  our sales force calls on high prescribing specialists  primarily gastroenterologists  and we monitor new and total prescriptions for our products as key performance indicators for our business 
prescriptions result in our products being used by patients  requiring our direct customers to purchase more products to replenish their inventory 
however  our revenue might fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to other factors  such as increased buying by wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase or because of the introduction of new products 
revenue could be less than anticipated in subsequent quarters as wholesalers increased inventory is used up 
our primary product candidates currently under development and their status are as follows compound indication status rifaximin hepatic encephalopathy  or he new drug application  or nda  submitted june   pdufa action date march  rifaximin irritable bowel syndrome  or ibs phase iii crofelemer hiv associated diarrhea phase iii balsalazide disodium tablet ulcerative colitis complete response letter submitted to the fda october   pdufa action date april  budesonide foam ulcerative proctitis phase iii critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales of our products  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets and legal issues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results might differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates  as well as the related disclosures  have been reviewed by and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents we recognize revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product at the time of sale only if our price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid us  or the buyer is obligated to pay us and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to us would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from any provided by us  we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we recognize revenues for product sales at the time title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  which is generally at the time products are shipped 
our net product revenue represents our total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated discounts  rebates  chargebacks  and product returns 
we establish allowances for estimated rebates  chargebacks and product returns based on numerous quantitative and qualitative factors  including the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  historical rebates  chargebacks and returns of products  direct communication with customers  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  the impact of changes in state and federal regulations  and estimated remaining shelf life of products 
in our analyses  we use prescription data purchased from a third party data provider to develop estimates of historical inventory channel pull through 
we utilize an internal analysis to compare historical net product shipments to estimated historical prescriptions written 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the channel that might be subject to various rebate  chargeback and product return exposures 
at least quarterly for each product line  we prepare an internal estimate of ending inventory units in the distribution channel by adding estimated inventory in the channel at the beginning of the period  plus net product shipments for the period  less estimated prescriptions written for the period 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the channel that might be subject to various rebate  chargeback and product return exposures 
this is done for each product line by applying a rate of historical activity for rebates  chargebacks and product returns  adjusted for relevant quantitative and qualitative factors discussed above  to the potential exposed product estimated to be in the distribution channel 
internal forecasts that are utilized to calculate the estimated number of months in the channel are regularly adjusted based on input from members of our sales  marketing and operations groups 
the adjusted forecasts take into account numerous factors including  but not limited to  new product introductions  direct communication with customers and potential product expiry issues 
consistent with industry practice  we periodically offer promotional discounts to our existing customers 
these discounts are calculated as a percentage of the current published list price and are treated as off invoice allowances 
accordingly  the discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the program is offered 
in addition to promotional discounts  at the time that we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customers an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of product at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not in excess of ordinary levels  therefore  we recognize the related revenue upon shipment and include the shipments in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these shipments represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure would be specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction in revenue at the time of such shipments 

table of contents allowances for estimated rebates and chargebacks were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these balances exclude amounts related to colazal  which are included in the reserve discussed below 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for items such as rebates due to various governmental organizations under the medicare medicaid regulations  rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts and chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing certain of our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements 
we estimate our liability for rebates and chargebacks at each reporting period based on a methodology of applying the relevant quantitative and qualitative assumptions discussed above 
due to the subjectivity of our accrual estimates for rebates and chargebacks  we prepare various sensitivity analyses to ensure our final estimate is within a reasonable range as well as review prior period activity to ensure that our methodology is still reasonable 
had a change in one or more variables in the analyses utilization rates  contract modifications  etc 
resulted in an additional percentage point change in the trailing average of estimated chargeback and rebate activity in  we would have recorded an adjustment to revenues of approximately million  or less than  for the year 
allowances for product returns were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for product that may be returned by the original purchaser in accordance with our stated return policy 
these balances include million and million at december  and  respectively  reflecting our estimate of colazal that may be returned to us under our return policy as a result of the approval of three generic balsalazide capsule products by the office of generic drugs on december  we estimate our liability for product returns at each reporting period based on historical return rates  the estimated inventory in the channel  and the other factors discussed above 
due to the subjectivity of our accrual estimates for product returns  we prepare various sensitivity analyses to ensure our final estimate is within a reasonable range as well as review prior period activity to ensure that our methodology is still reasonable 
a change in assumptions that resulted in a change in forecasted return rates for all products other than colazal would have resulted in a change in total product returns liability at december  of approximately million and a corresponding change in net product revenue of less than 
colazal  our balsalazide disodium capsule  accounted for a majority of the company s revenue prior to on december   the office of generic drugs  or ogd  approved three generic balsalazide capsule products 
as a result of these generic approvals  the company expects the future sales of colazal to be significantly less than historical sales of colazal 
at december  and  respectively  million and million were recorded as a liability to reflect the company s estimate of the company s liability for colazal that may be returned by the original purchaser in accordance with the company s stated return policy as a result of these generic approvals 
this estimate was developed based on the following estimates our estimate of the quantity and expiration dates of colazal inventory in the distribution channel based on historical net product shipments less estimated historical prescriptions written  our estimate of future demand for colazal based on the actual erosion of product demand for several comparable products that were previously genericized  and the most recent demand for colazal prior to the generic approvals  the actual demand for colazal experienced during and subsequent to the generic approvals  our estimate of chargeback and rebate activity based on price erosion as a result of the generic approvals  and other relevant factors 
due to the subjectivity of this estimate  the company prepares various sensitivity analyses to ensure the company s final estimate is within a reasonable range 
a change in assumptions that resulted in a change in the quantity of colazal inventory in the distribution channel would have resulted in a change in the colazal return reserve of approximately million and a corresponding change in net product revenue of less than 
a change in assumptions that resulted in a change in the estimated future demand of colazal would not have resulted in a change in the colazal return reserve 
for the years ended december  and  our absolute exposure for rebates  chargebacks and product returns has grown primarily as a result of increased sales of our existing products  the approval of new products and the acquisition of products  and also as a result of the approval of generic balsalazide capsule products 
accordingly  
table of contents reductions to revenue and corresponding increases to allowance accounts have likewise increased 
the estimated exposure to these revenue reducing items as a percentage of gross product revenue in the year ended december  and was and for rebates  chargebacks and discounts and was and for product returns excluding the colazal return reserve  respectively 
this percentage was higher in due to an unexpected large return from a small wholesaler 
increases to the colazal return reserve was of gross product revenue in during the fourth quarter of we recognized million of net product revenue related to shipments to wholesalers of apriso  which was approved by the fda on october   and launched to physicians in late february based on our historical experience with colazal  which has the same indication  is distributed through the same distribution channels and prescribed by the same physicians as apriso  we have the ability to estimate returns for apriso and therefore recognized revenue upon shipment 
during the fourth quarter of we shipped metozolv to wholesalers and began detailing this drug to physicians 
because we have limited experience with metozolv s indication we do not currently have the ability to estimate returns for metozolv 
we will recognize revenue for metozolv based upon prescription pull through until we have enough historical information to estimate returns 
inventories raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories are stated at the lower of cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out cost method or market 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life  and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition  including generic competition 
we expense pre approval inventory unless we believe it is probable that the inventory will be saleable 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with marketed products and certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
capitalization of this inventory does not begin until the product candidate is considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval  which is generally after we have analyzed phase iii data or filed an nda 
if we are aware of any specific risks or contingencies that are likely to impact the expected regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety  efficacy  manufacturing  marketing or labeling of the product candidate  we do not capitalize the related inventory 
once we capitalize inventory for a product candidate that is not yet approved  we monitor  on a quarterly basis  the status of this candidate within the regulatory approval process 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in our judgment of future commercial use and net realizable value  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in the timeline for commercialization or other potential factors 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate all inventory  including inventory capitalized for which regulatory approval has not yet been obtained  to determine if any lower of cost or market adjustment is required 
as it relates to pre approval inventory  we consider several factors including expected timing of fda approval  projected sales volume and estimated selling price 
inventory at december  consisted of million of raw materials  million of work in process and million of finished goods 
inventory at december  consisted of million of raw materials  million of work in process and million of finished goods 
as of december   we had recorded inventory reserves totaling million  compared to million as of december   to reduce inventories to their net realizable value 
the higher inventory reserve at december  was due to a reserve for inventory related to balsalazide tablets 
in december we received a complete response letter from the fda on the balsalazide tablet nda  which indicated that based on its review  the fda had determined that the application could not be approved as it stood and that clinical data from an additional adequate and well controlled clinical trial was required in order to conduct further review of the nda 
we do not intend to conduct additional clinical investigation of balsalazide tablets in this indication  as a result we reserved the inventory related to balsalazide tablets 
we filed a complete response to the fda on october  
table of contents intangible assets and goodwill the company s intangible assets consist of license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  which result from product and business acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
when the company makes product acquisitions that include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  it records the purchase price of such intangibles  along with the value of the product related liabilities that we assume  as intangible assets 
the company allocates the aggregate purchase price to the fair value of the various tangible and intangible assets in order to determine the appropriate carrying value of the acquired assets and then amortizes the cost of the intangible assets as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related assets 
the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
the company believes the following factors could trigger an impairment review significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
in assessing the recoverability of its intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  the company must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than the carrying value  the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable

the notes are convertible into approximately  shares of our common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  which represents a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of august  only if one or more of the following conditions is satisfied during any fiscal quarter commencing after september   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is equal to or more than of the conversion price of the notes on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes  per  principal amount of the notes  for each such trading day was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate of the notes on such date  if we enter into specified corporate transactions  or upon a redemption notice 
the first of these conditions was met as of december  the notes will be convertible  regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions has been satisfied  on or after march  at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the stated maturity date of august  upon conversion  we will pay cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and stock  as determined by us in our discretion 
as long as the notes are outstanding  we are prohibited from incurring any debt other than permitted debt  as defined in the indenture  except that we may incur debt in certain circumstances  including meeting a consolidated leverage ratio test and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio test 
we may refinance our existing credit facility provided the refinanced credit facility contains substantially the same restrictive covenants with respect to financial ratios as the existing credit facility did as of august  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  and cash and cash equivalent balances of million 
we expect to approach profitability and have positive cash flow during  assuming we receive fda approval for rifaximin in hepatic encephalopathy 
we believe our cash and cash equivalent balances should be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
based on our current projections  we believe that we will be able to return to a positive cash flow position without requiring additional capital 
however  we might seek additional debt or equity financing or both to fund our operations or acquisitions  and our actual cash needs might vary materially from those now planned because of a number of factors including general economic conditions  fda and foreign regulatory processes  the status of competitive products  including potential generics  intellectual property risks  our ability to maintain our current credit facility  our success selling products  the results of research and development activities  establishment of and change in collaborative relationships  technological advances by us and other pharmaceutical companies  and whether we acquire rights to additional products 
if we incur more debt  we might be restricted in our ability to raise additional capital and might be subject to financial and restrictive covenants 
if we issue additional equity  our stockholders could suffer dilution 
we might also enter into additional collaborative arrangements that could provide us with additional funding in the form of equity  debt  licensing  milestone and or royalty payments 
we might not be able to enter into such arrangements or raise any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

asu no 
 which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements and provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previous accounting principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
if the fair value of all of the 
table of contents elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets asu no 

asu no 
prescribes the information that a reporting entity must provide in its financial reports about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
specifically  among other aspects  this standard amends previously issued accounting guidance  modifies the financial components approach and removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity when accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and removes the exception from applying the general accounting principles for the consolidation of variable interest entities that are qualifying special purpose entities 
this new accounting standard is effective for transfers of financial assets occurring on or after january  the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu no 

asu no 
amends previously issued accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities to require an enterprise to determine whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this amended consolidation guidance for variable interest entities also replaces the existing quantitative approach for identifying which enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity  which was based on which enterprise is exposed to a majority of the risks and rewards  with a qualitative approach  based on which enterprise has both the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
this new standard may affect how an enterprise accounts for the consolidation of common structures  such as joint ventures  equity method investments  collaboration and other agreements and purchase arrangements 
under this revised guidance  more entities may meet the definition of a variable interest entity  and the determination about whether an enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity is required to be evaluated continuously 
this standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after january  the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our purchases of raw materials and finished goods are denominated primarily in us dollars  purchases denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are insignificant 
additionally  our net assets denominated in 
table of contents currencies other than the us dollar are insignificant and have not historically exposed us to material risk associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
given these facts  we have not considered it necessary to use foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage changes in currency rates 
however  these circumstances might change
