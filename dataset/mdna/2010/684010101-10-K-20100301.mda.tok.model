education services the company began reporting revenues and losses before taxes in education services as a result of the acquisition of optionetics  which closed on may  liquidity and capital resources as a holding company  almost all of the funds generated from our operations are earned by our operating subsidiaries 
we access these funds through receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries 
some of our subsidiaries are subject to requirements of various regulatory bodies  including the sec  finra  the cboe  the cftc and the nfa  relating to liquidity and capital standards  which may limit the funds available for the payment of dividends to us 
we invest company cash in a variety of high credit quality investment vehicles including us government treasury bills  bank issued commercial paper  aaa rated institutional money market funds and tax free ars backed by united states department of education guaranteed student loans issued under the ffelp 
our ars are marketable securities with long term stated maturities during years for which the interest rates are reset through periodic short term auctions every or days  depending on the issue 
as a result of the liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  all of the auctions for all our ars have failed since february failed auctions limit liquidity for ars holders until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the security  or another market for ars develops 
our ars portfolio consists entirely of securities backed by student loans issued under the ffelp program  which are individually guaranteed by the united states department of education 
all of our ars are aaa rated with the exception of two issues totaling million in par value  and all of our ars are current with respect to receipt of interest payments according to the stated terms of each ars indenture 
as of the date of this report  we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ars will be unable to satisfy the terms of the indentures or that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ars investments has deteriorated 
since the ars markets began failing on february   million of our ars securities have been redeemed by issuers or our brokers at par 
we believe we have the ability  if necessary  to hold our ars investments until such time as the auctions are successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or another market for ars develops 
at december   there was insufficient observable ars market information available to determine the market value of our investments in ars 
therefore  we have continued to designate the ars as level financial assets under financial accounting standards board fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc and estimated the level fair values for these securities by using the income method  incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
we calculate the income by developing a discounted cash flow model based on the expected cash flows from the ars compared to a market rate 
for the economic life of the ars  we relied on estimates based in part on issuer statements regarding the intent and likelihood of the ars being redeemed or refinanced  the economic life of the loans currently outstanding in the trusts and observed redemption and refinance activity throughout based on our analysis  the weighted average economic life was estimated to be approximately four years 
we used the current yield of the ars  which we then adjusted for the expected tax benefit 
for the fair market interest rates used in our discounting analysis  we used a current market rate for liquid debt instruments of similar underlying assets and credit quality  with spreads of approximately bps bps over the london interbank offered rate libor 
we also relied upon the indentures underlying the ars and other market information in determining these assumptions 
of the million par value of ars as of december   approximately million were sold by ubs and have been classified as trading securities 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs  entitling us to sell at par value ars originally purchased from ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july   the ubs put right 
prior to june   ubs is offering no net cost loans using our eligible ars as collateral to provide interim liquidity 
in accepting the offer  we granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of ars 
ars will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ars if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the offer are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the offer 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the offer 
we have adopted the fair value option under fasb asc topic  financial instruments  to classify the ubs put right and the ars sold by ubs as trading securities 
our calculation of fair value of the ubs ars at december  implied an impairment of fair value of approximately million  which has been recorded as an unrealized loss in other income on the consolidated statement of operations 
this impairment has been substantially offset by a realized gain in the value of the ubs put right 
the fair value of the ars held at ubs is approximately million 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  we may incur losses on these ars 
the remaining million in par value ars were sold by another investment advisor  who has not made an offer similar to ubs  and therefore  we have continued to classify them as available for sale securities 
our calculation of fair value of the ars not held at ubs at december  implied an impairment of fair value of approximately million  which has been recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income on the statement of financial condition  and the carrying fair value of those ars was approximately million 
if the market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or impairment charges 
we may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures

liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in customer brokerage accounts  which were  million at december  credit facility we generally finance our operating liquidity and capital needs through the use of funds generated from operations and the issuance of common stock 
to support our self clearing activities  we have an unsecured  uncommitted credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na that is callable on demand 
we anticipate that the credit facility will only be used occasionally  addressing potential timing issues with the flow of customer funds  and will only be used to facilitate transactions for which customers already have sufficient funds in brokerage accounts 
as of december   there was no balance outstanding on this credit facility 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may issue equity or debt securities or enter into secured or additional unsecured lines of credit from time to time 
cash flow cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities decreased due to the increase of cash segregated in compliance with federal regulations and receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations which was partially offset by the increase of payables to brokerage customers and the decrease in net income 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the decreased redemptions of investments in securities 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease of cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the reduction of cash used to repurchase our outstanding common stock 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in capital expenditures was related to a decreased level of fixed asset additions 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included capitalized software development costs  which we capitalized in accordance with fasb asc topic  website development costs asc  primarily related to the development of our technology 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  there are certain customer activities that may result in contingencies that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities may expose us to off balance sheet credit risk in the event the customers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations 
many of our customer accounts are margin accounts 
in margin transactions  we may be obligated for credit extended to our customers by our clearing firms and subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements 
see risk factors we are subject to various forms of credit risk  and those risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial situation for a more detailed discussion of this risks associated with these arrangements

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the accounting policies that have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment related to the valuation of our goodwill  the fair value of our contingent liability  the fair value of our investments in securities  specifically our investments in ars  and capitalization our of software development 
valuation of goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis  or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing the impairment tests  we utilize quoted market prices of our common stock to estimate the fair value of the company as a whole 
the estimated fair value is then allocated to our reporting units  if applicable  based on operating revenues  and is compared with the carrying value of the reporting units 
contingent consideration we fair value the contingent consideration on at least a quarterly basis  or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the fair value has materially changed 
in performing the fair value valuation  we use a discounted cash flow model to value our contingent consideration liability 
our valuation model is based on both the estimated future profitability and the number of new customer accounts generated by the business unit 
investments in securities our investments in securities consist of ars backed by student loans issued under the ffelp program and the ubs put right associated with ars held at ubs 
we determine the fair value of our ars and the ubs put right using the income method 
we calculate the income by developing a discounted cash flow model based on the expected cash flows from the ars compared to a market rate 
for additional information regarding our ars and our valuation methodology and assumptions  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for the available for sale ars  if the calculated fair value is below the carrying amount of the securities  we then determine if the decline in value is other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in underlying credit ratings  forecasted recovery  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and the probability that the scheduled cash payments will continue to be made 
when we conclude that an impairment is other than temporary  the difference between the fair value and the carrying value is recorded as an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations 
impairments that we conclude are temporary are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
software costs associated with software developed for internal use include capitalized costs based on asc capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software and payroll for employees directly associated with  and who devote time to  the development of the internal use software 
costs incurred in development and enhancement of the software that does not meet the capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred 
these capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
the critical estimate related to this process is the determination of the amount of time devoted by employees to specific stages of internal use software development projects 
we utilize a project management system to assist in validating the underlying estimates used in the determination of time devoted 
we periodically review the capitalized costs for impairment 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu amends asc by requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
we do not have material exposure to commodity price changes  foreign currency fluctuations or similar market risks other than the effect they may have on trading volumes 
accordingly  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to mitigate such risks 
interest rate risk as a self clearing broker dealer  we hold interest earning assets  which mainly consist of customer funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations 
interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities in the form of customer cash balances 
we earn a net interest spread on the customer balances  as well as on the difference between amounts earned on customer margin loans and amounts paid on customer cash balances 
since we set the rate paid on customer cash balances and the rate charged on customer margin loans  we are able to manage a portion of our interest rate risk 
however  a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread while a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread 
we also earn fees on our customer cash balances that are swept to a third party fdic program 
these fees generally increase in a rising rate environment and decline in falling rate environment 
we have estimated the additional impact to pretax income that hypothetical interest rate changes would have to balances as of december  we estimate that as of december   an immediate basis point increase in short term rates would result in an addition of approximately million in annual pre tax income from current levels 
although it is difficult to anticipate the behavior of money market participants if the federal funds target rate is lowered from a range of bps bps to bps  we estimate that a federal funds rate of bps would result in approximately million less in annual pretax income from current levels 
credit risk we extend margin credit and leverage to our customers  which are subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements 
margin credit balances are collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
leverage involves securing a large potential future obligation with a lesser amount of cash or securities 
the risks associated with margin credit and leverage increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where leverage or collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit or leverage and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of liquidation 
we are exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities or futures transactions that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
at december   we had million in credit extended to our customers 
in addition  we may be obligated for margin extended to our customers by our third party clearing agents on collateralized securities and futures positions 
the margin and leverage requirements that we impose on our customer accounts meet or exceed those required by various regulatory requirements and regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve 
the amount of this risk is not quantifiable since the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices 
as a result  we are exposed to significant off balance sheet credit risk in the event customer collateral is not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur 
in the event customers fail to satisfy their obligations  we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customers obligations 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements  and no liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we borrow securities temporarily from other broker dealers in connection with our broker dealer business 
we deposit cash as collateral for the securities borrowed 
decreases in securities prices may cause the market value of the securities borrowed to fall below the amount of cash deposited as collateral 
in the event the counterparty to these transactions does not return the cash deposited  we may be exposed to the risk of selling the securities at prevailing market prices 
we seek to manage this risk by requiring credit approvals for counterparties  by monitoring the securities values on a daily basis  and by requiring additional collateral as needed 
securities risk in order to help us provide our customers with the most favorable trade execution  we sometimes take proprietary short term positions in listed equity and option securities 
we attempt to manage this risk by hedging our proprietary positions so that changes in market prices do not materially change the value of our securities 
however  our hedging strategy may not be effective and may expose us to losses on these securities
