overview we develop  manufacture and sell proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industries 
these industries depend on a broad range of tests  called bioassays  to perform diagnostic tests  discover and develop new drugs and identify genes 
our xmap technology  an open architecture  multiplexing technology  allows simultaneous analysis of up to bioassays from a small sample volume  typically a single drop of fluid  by reading biological tests on the surface of microscopic polystyrene beads called microspheres 
xmap technology combines this miniaturized liquid array bioassay capability with small lasers  digital signal processors and proprietary software to create a system offering advantages in speed  precision  flexibility and cost 
our xmap technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry which includes the fields of drug discovery and development  clinical diagnostics  genetic analysis  bio defense  protein analysis and biomedical research 
our end user customers and partners  which include laboratory professionals performing research  clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by a physician and other laboratories  have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible 
luminex has adopted a business model built  in part  around strategic partnerships 
we have licensed our xmap technology to partner companies  which in turn then develop products that incorporate the xmap technology into products that partners sell to end users 
luminex develops and manufactures the proprietary xmap laboratory instrumentation and the proprietary xmap microspheres and sells these products to its partners 
our partners then sell xmap instrumentation and xmap based reagent consumable products  which run on the instrumentation  to the end user laboratory 
as of december   luminex had approximately strategic partners and these partners have purchased from luminex over  xmap based systems 
of the strategic partners  have released commercialized reagent based products utilizing our technology 
beginning in  we began developing proprietary assays through lbg 
this development was supplemented in by our acquisition of tm bioscience  which we now refer to as lmd 
our assay segment focuses on the molecular diagnostics market and certain specialty markets 
luminex has several forms of revenue that result from our business model system revenue is generated from the sale of our xmap systems and peripherals 
currently  system revenue is derived from the sale of the luminex and analyzers  our flexmap d system  optional xy platform and sheath delivery systems 
consumable revenue is generated from the sale of our dyed polystyrene microspheres and sheath fluid 
our larger commercial and development partners often purchase these consumables in bulk to minimize the number of incoming qualification events and to allow for longer development and production runs 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells our proprietary microspheres to an end user  a partner sells a kit incorporating our proprietary microspheres to an end user or when a partner utilizes a kit to provide a testing result to a user 
end users can be facilities such as testing labs  development facilities and research facilities that buy prepared kits and have specific testing needs or testing service companies that provide assay results to pharmaceutical research companies or physicians 
assay revenue is generated from the sale of our kits which are a combination of chemical and biological reagents and our proprietary bead technology used to perform diagnostic and research assays on samples 
service revenue is generated when a partner or other owner of a system purchases a service contract from us after the standard warranty has expired 
service contract revenue is amortized over the life of the contract and the costs associated with those contracts are recognized as incurred 
other revenue consists of items such as training  shipping  parts sales  license revenue  grant revenue  contract research and development fees  milestone revenue and other items that individually amount to less than of total revenue 

table of contents highlights luminex grew total revenue by approximately over revenue to million gross margin percentage of  compared to in for the year ended  assay revenue increased  royalty revenue increased and system sales increased over the prior calendar year full commercial launch of the high throughput flexmap d multiplexing system system shipments of  resulting in cumulative life to date shipments of  up from a year ago our partners reported over million of royalty bearing end user sales on xmap technology for the year  an increase over settlement of suny lawsuit  resulting in a one time charge of approximately million establishment of offices in shanghai  people s republic of china and tokyo  japan to provide commercial support and service to customers and partners in these markets obtained registration certificate from the people s republic of china for the luminex and luminex systems tax benefit from the release of the us deferred tax asset valuation allowance provided a one time benefit of million  or per share  basic consumable sales trends we have experienced a decline in consumable revenue since the third quarter of after thorough analysis of the decline  we have identified several factors contributing to the decline  none of which individually appear to be systemic in nature or indicative of future results 
overall  the decline manifested itself through a decline in activity at varying times from our largest  bulk purchasing partners 
from the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of  we had bulk purchases totaling million  million  million  million  million  and million in consumables  respectively 
alternatively  non bulk consumable sales varied within a much smaller range between million and million with the largest amount of non bulk sales taking place in the third quarter of with million of consumables 
we believe the decrease in bulk purchases can be attributed to several factors including purchases in prior periods of significant volumes of consumables related to the conversion of our partners assay product portfolios from carboxyl beads to magnetic beads primarily in anticipation of the release of our new magpix system in  volume reductions in bulk purchases from several of our partners as a result of a reduction in total consumable needs prior to the regulatory clearance and commercialization phases of development of new products and transitioning product lines  increased attention on inventory management by our partners during as a result of the macro economic climate and an increase in our partners focus on generating current revenue from commercialized products 
we anticipate consumables sales will improve in the success of our partners commercialization efforts is reflected in the rising level of royalties and reported royalty bearing sales during the period over which the consumable revenue has declined 
reported royalty bearing sales have increased by from million in to million in release of valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of  we released a portion of our total valuation allowance on deferred us tax assets 
release of the valuation allowance was dependent upon an assessment of the likelihood of utilization of the specifically identified deferred tax assets 
the assessment indicated that luminex was more likely than not to benefit from the deferred tax assets based upon our historical pre tax book income and projected taxable income  thus prompting the release 
the tax benefit from the release of this deferred tax asset valuation allowance is reflected below operating income as a benefit of million in  or per share  basic 
as a result of the release of our valuation allowance on us tax assets  our effective tax rate  which has been relatively low  will increase significantly in the near term 
for  we estimate that our effective tax rate will be in excess of the maximum us corporate tax rate of  however  for the full year  we expect cash taxes paid will be less than of total income tax expense recognized for the full year 
the quarterly effective tax rate for will fluctuate as a result of variability of the taxable income within the multiple jurisdictions the united states  canada  the netherlands  china and japan in which we operate 

table of contents change in cash position our cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased by approximately million during the year ended december  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of million partially offset by positive operating cash flows 
segment information luminex has two reportable segments the technology segment and the assay segment 
the technology segment  which is our base business  consists of system sales to partners and end customers  raw bead sales  royalties  service and support of the technology  and other miscellaneous items 
the assay segment consists of lbg and lmd 
this segment is primarily involved in the development and sale of assays on xmap technology for use on luminex s installed base of systems 
future operations we anticipate revenue growth to be driven by continued adoption of our core technology coupled with system and assay introductions and commercialization by luminex and our partners 
we anticipate continued revenue concentration in our high margin items assays  consumables and royalties contributing to favorable  but variable gross margin percentages 
additionally  we believe that a sustained investment in r d is necessary in order to meet the needs of our marketplace and provide a sustainable new product pipeline 
therefore  we estimate that r d expenditures will increase in absolute dollars over time  but decrease as a percentage of total revenue towards our long term target of of revenue 
we could experience volatility in r d expenses as a percentage of revenue on a quarterly basis 
consistent with this trend our r d expenses increased by million or from to  but dropped as a percentage of total revenue to in compared to in while we currently expect modest increases in absolute dollars of selling  general  and administrative expenses in  excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates on foreign denominated balances  we expect selling  general  and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue in we expect our primary challenges in to be the continued adoption and development of partner products incorporating luminex technology  the timing effect of the ongoing uncertainty in global finance markets and changes in government funding on planned purchases by end users  commercialization  regulatory acceptance and market adoption of output from the assay segment and the expansion and enhancement of our installed base and leadership position within our identified target market segments 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements  and the judgments and estimates involved under each 
we also have other significant accounting policies that do not involve critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective 
these are described in note of our consolidated financial statements provided herein in item estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable 
these criteria are generally met at the time our product is shipped 
if the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment  the revenue is deferred until all criteria are met 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our technology  provides testing services to third parties using our technology or resells our consumables 
royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us by our partners  generally quarterly  therefore  the underlying end user sales may be related to prior periods due to the timing of when the revenue is reported to us by our partners 
we also sell extended service contracts for maintenance and support of our products 
revenue for service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue from contracts with multiple elements is recognized as each element is earned based on the relative selling price of each element when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and when the amount is not contingent upon delivery of the undelivered elements 
upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or applied against royalty payments 
nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue over the estimated life of the license agreements 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined according to the standard cost method 
inventories have been written down through an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory are i a specific write down for inventory items that we no longer use in the manufacture of our products or that no longer meet our specifications and ii a write down against slow moving items for potential obsolescence 
inventory is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
while management believes that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  scientific and technological advances will continue and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
however  we do not believe this estimate is subject to significant variability 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
while management believes that adequate reserve has been made in the consolidated financial statements for product warranties  should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
however  we do not believe this estimate is subject to significant variability 
purchase price allocation  intangibles and goodwill 
the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently if there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in performing the impairment test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under us gaap 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if in step one of the annual test  the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed in step two to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
we would recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
determining the fair value of goodwill is subjective in nature and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
as of december   we have million of goodwill allocated to the assay segment  which includes lmd 
our annual test did not result in an impairment charge as the estimated fair value of the assay segment reporting unit continues to exceed the carrying value by a significant enough amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analysis  including terminal growth rates and the discount rate  would not cause the carrying value to exceed the estimated fair value for the reporting unit as determined under the step one goodwill impairment analysis 

table of contents we utilize the income approach based on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine its fair value estimates  and then use market comparisons as a reasonability check to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market comparisons yielded significantly different results 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow dcf analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
as our assay segment and goodwill came into existence in due to our acquisition of tm biosciences  now referred to as lmd  we believe that the dcf method best aligns with how we approached the acquisition and determined the value of the acquired company 
this methodology used to determine fair value has been consistently applied since the inception of our goodwill in  however  the assumptions and estimates are updated each year 
our estimates are based on revenue projections by product line  and include judgment based on historical growth and scheduled product approvals by the various governmental authorities 
we believe its assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate  based upon the estimated weighted average cost of capital wacc  and the terminal growth rate  based upon strategic studies we commissioned and our own internal analysis 
we used the following rates in assumptions wacc terminal growth rate to determine our wacc rate  we performed a peer company analysis and considered the weighted average return on debt and equity  the updated risk free interest rate  beta  equity risk premium  and entity specific size risk premium 
we based our terminal growth rates upon market estimates provided in strategic studies previously commissioned by us and our own internal analysis 
our analysis yielded an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value by over for concurrent with the above analysis  we performed a sensitivity analysis based upon reasonably likely changes to determine if our dcf analysis would result in impairment if the following changes were made to our assumptions i assumed wacc rate was increased by percentage points  ii future revenue was of our projections in the dcf model  or iii the terminal growth rate used was lower 
none of these sensitivity analyses resulted in an estimated fair value less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
accounting for income taxes 
we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  judgment is required 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical income  projected future income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered permanently reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for us federal or state income taxes has been provided thereon 
effective january   we adopted accounting standards codification asc income taxes asc which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
these provisions require recognition of the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 
determining the consolidated provision for income taxes involves judgments  estimates and the application of complex tax regulations 
we are required to provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate  including estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
although we believe that we have provided adequate liabilities for uncertain tax positions  the actual liability resulting from examinations by taxing authorities could differ from the recorded income tax liabilities and could result in additional income tax expense 
in accordance with asc  changes of estimates in our income tax liabilities are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which the factors resulting in the change to our estimate become known to us 
as a result  our effective income tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

table of contents we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
stock compensation 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected volatility  expected term and risk free rate of return 
calculation of expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term is calculated using the contractual term of the options as well as an analysis of our historical exercises of stock options 
the estimate of risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  thus we have assumed a dividend yield 
we are required to estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust compensation cost recorded accordingly 
the estimate of forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture performance and will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income  and net income per share

gross profit increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the gross profit margin rate gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december  maintenance of our gross profit margin rate was enabled by the high concentration of sales in our higher margin items such as assays  consumables and royalties 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the overall increase in revenue 
we anticipate continued fluctuation in gross profit margin and related gross profit primarily as a result of variability in partner bulk purchases and the absolute number of quarterly system sales 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased activity by the assay segment related to product development  an increase in materials  and additional personnel costs associated with the addition of employees and contract employees

for comparative purposes  these same two customers accounted for of total technology segment revenue and  respectively in the year ended december  we believe that the decrease in percentage of total revenue represented by our two largest customers is primarily the result of specific company factors and general market factors applicable to our two largest customers 
these factors  we believe  resulted in a decrease in the dollar amount of bulk purchases by one of our largest customers  and a decline in system purchases relative to their historical purchases by the other

partners who reported royalty bearing sales accounted for million  or  of total consumable sales for the year ended december  a bulk purchase is defined as the purchase of  or more of consumables in a quarter 
as the number of applications available on our platform expands  we anticipate that the overall level of consumable sales  and related bulk purchases  will continue to fluctuate 
royalty revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we believe this is primarily the result of our increased cumulative instrument placements  menu expansion  and utilization of our partners assays on our technology 
we expect modest fluctuations in the number of commercial partners submitting royalties quarter to quarter based upon the varying contractual terms  consolidations among partners  differing reporting and payment requirements  and the addition of new partners 
for the year ended december   we had commercial partners submit royalties as compared with for the year ended december  additionally  the partners from whom we recognized million in royalties in represented approximately million of the total royalties in  an increase of approximately over their prior year payments 
total royalty bearing sales reported to us by our partners were approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service contracts  comprised of extended warranty contracts earned ratably over the term of a contract  increased to million during from million in this increase is attributable to additional resources allocated to the sale of extended service agreements resulting in increased penetration of the expanded installed base

at december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments of million and had working capital of million 
cash  cash equivalents and investments have decreased by approximately million during the year ended december  due primarily to capital expenditures and an increase in our accounts receivable 
we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities in conjunction with an initial public offering in  subsequent option exercises  and our follow on public offering in and cash generated from operations 
our cash reserves are held directly or indirectly in a variety of short term  interest bearing instruments  including obligations of the united states government or agencies thereof and united states corporate debt securities 
we do not have any investments in asset backed commercial paper  auction rate securities  or mortgage backed or sub prime style investments

capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment increased to million from million in the increase is primarily related to leasehold improvements for additional space leased in the us and the netherlands  acquisitions of flexmap d systems for internal use  leasehold improvements for our new office in the people s republic of china  and purchases of equipment for our business continuity site 
currently  exclusive of changes in investments  we expect cash used in investing activities to be primarily for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared with cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  due to our follow on public offering in june of of million and a decrease in the proceeds from issuance of common stock due to exercises of stock options and warrants of million in compared to million in our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the need to acquire licenses to new technology  costs associated with strategic acquisitions including integration costs and assumed liabilities  litigation expense  the status of competitive products and potential cost associated with both protecting and defending our intellectual property 
additionally  actions taken as a result of the ongoing internal evaluation of our business could result in expenditures not currently contemplated in our estimates for we believe  however  that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our operating expenses  capital equipment requirements and other expected liquidity requirements for the coming twelve months 
factors that could affect our capital requirements  in addition to those listed above include i continued collections of accounts receivable consistent with our historical experience  ii our ability to manage our inventory levels consistent with past practices  and iii signing of partnership agreements which include significant up front license fees 
see also the safe harbor cautionary statement and item a risk factors above 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and deployment of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all  particularly given the current state of the capital markets 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   we had approximately million in non cancelable obligations for the next months 
these obligations are included in our estimated cash usage during the following table reflects our total current non cancelable obligations by period as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years non cancelable rental obligations non cancelable purchase obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations total purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders primarily as a result of normal inventory purchases or minimum payments due resulting when minimum purchase commitments are not met 
on december   lmd entered into an agreement with the ministry of industry of the government of canada under which the government agreed to invest up to canadian cdn million relating to the development of several genetic tests 
this agreement was amended in march funds were advanced from technology partnerships canada tpc  a special operating program 
the actual payments we received were predicated on eligible expenditures made during the project period which ended july  lmd has received cdn million from tpc which is expected to be repaid along with approximately cdn million of imputed interest for a total of approximately cdn million 
lmd has agreed to repay the tpc funding through a royalty on revenues 
royalty payments commenced in at a rate of of total revenue and at a rate of for and thereafter 
aggregate royalty repayment will continue until total advances plus imputed interest has been repaid or until december   whichever is earlier 
the repayment obligation expires on december  and any unpaid balance will be cancelled and forgiven on that date 
should the term of repayment be shorter than expected due to higher than expected assay revenue  the effective interest rate would increase as repayment is accelerated 
repayments denominated in us dollars are currently projected to be as shown in the table above  but actual future sales generating a repayment obligation will vary from this projection and are subject to the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report  including under risk factors and safe harbor cautionary statement 
furthermore  payment reflected in us dollars is subject to adjustment based upon applicable exchange rates as of the reporting date 
the amount due within one year  as shown in the table above  is our estimated repayment amount based on the current projected sales for the full year due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with luminex s unrecognized tax benefits at december   luminex is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a direct adverse effect on our operations to date 
however  a substantial increase in product and manufacturing costs and personnel related expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the event these expenses increase at a faster pace than we can increase our system  consumable and royalty rates 

table of contents recently adopted accounting standards in june  the fasb issued asc update no 
asu no 
 topic generally accepted accounting principles  which amends the asc for the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
asu no 
includes sfas no 
in its entirety and establishes the asc as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by fasb for all nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap 
for sec registrants  rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities laws are also considered authoritative sources of gaap 
the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the fasb asc for fiscal year ended december  the adoption had no impact on our financial statements 
all references to authoritative guidance have been updated to cite relevant asc topics  as applicable 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb recently amended its guidance on the information that a reporting entity must provide in its financial reports about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
specifically  among other aspects  the new guidance amends previous guidance related to the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  variable interest entities that are qualifying special purpose entities and the financial components approach 
the new guidance is effective for transfer of financial assets occurring on or after january  we have not determined the effect that the adoption of the new guidance will have on its financial position or results of operations but the effect will generally be limited to future transactions 
historically  we have not had any material transfers of financial assets 
additionally  the fasb recently amended its guidance surrounding a company s analysis to determine whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
this new guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the guidance is effective for all variable interest entities and relationships with variable interest entities existing as of january  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb updated its revenue recognition guidance  amending the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the amendments will eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of this update and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb updated its software guidance  changing the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
in addition  the amendments require that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of this update and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in january  the fasb updated it guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement in order to improve these disclosures and  thus  increase the transparency in financial reporting 
specifically  guidance will require a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers and present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs 
in addition  the fasb clarified the disclosure requirements related to the use of judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities when reporting fair value measurement for each class and about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of this update and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates  particularly since our investments are in short term and long term instruments available for sale 
a basis point fluctuation from average investment returns at december  would yield an approximate variance in overall investment return 
due to our intention to hold our investments to maturity  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency risk 
as of december   as a result of our foreign operations  we have costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily canadian dollars and to a lesser extent the euro  renminbi  and yen 
for example  some fixed asset purchases  certain expenses  and the tpc debt of our canadian subsidiary  lmd  are denominated in canadian dollars while sales of products are primarily denominated in us dollars 
all transactions in our netherlands and japanese subsidiaries are denominated in euros and yen  respectively 
all transactions  with the exception of our initial capital investment  in our chinese subsidiary are denominated in renminbi 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
a significant majority of our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
the impact of foreign exchange on foreign denominated balances will vary in relation to changes between the us and canadian dollar  euro  yen  and renminbi exchange rates 
a change in these exchange rates in relation to the us dollar would result in an immaterial foreign exchange impact 
as a result of our efforts to expand globally  in the future we will be exposed to additional foreign currency risk in multiple currencies  however  at this time  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is not material 
in addition  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 
for example  currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rates fluctuations could affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  we cannot give any assurance as to the effect that future changes in foreign currency rates will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our aggregate foreign currency transaction loss of  was included in determining our consolidated results for the year ended december
