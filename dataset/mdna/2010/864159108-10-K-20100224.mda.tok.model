item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview sturm  ruger company  inc the company is principally engaged in the design  manufacture  and sale of firearms to domestic customers 
approximately of the company s total sales for were firearms sales  and were investment castings sales 
export sales represent less than of total sales 
the company s design and manufacturing operations are located in the united states and almost all product content is domestic 
the company s firearms are sold through a select number of independent wholesale distributors  principally to the commercial sporting market 
the company manufactures investment castings made from steel alloys for internal use in its firearms and utilizes excess investment casting capacity to manufacture and sell castings to unaffiliated  third party customers 
because most of the company s competitors are not subject to public filing requirements and industry wide data is generally not available in a timely manner  the company is unable to compare its performance to other companies or specific current industry trends 
instead  the company measures itself against its own historical results 
the company does not consider its overall firearms business to be predictably seasonal  however  sales of many models of firearms are usually lower in the third quarter of the year 
results of operations product demand incoming unit orders in increased from  and from the extraordinary retail demand that began in the latter months of caused independent distributors to place very large orders for our products in  particularly during the first half of the year when orders from distributors substantially exceeded their sales of our products to retailers 
this resulted in the company having an abnormally large backlog of unshipped distributor orders throughout the company has temporarily placed less emphasis on incoming orders as a proxy for market demand 
instead  the company is using the following estimate of sell through of our products from distributors to retailers as a proxy for actual market demand and as a metric for planning production 
note  however  that we believe a portion of the sell through from distributors to retailers resulted in an inventory build at retail rather than sales from retailers to consumers 
units ordered estimated units sold from distributors to retailers units on backorder 
table of contents the estimates for each period were calculated by taking the beginning inventory at the distributors  plus shipments from the company to distributors during the period  less the ending inventory at distributors 
these estimates are only a proxy for actual market demand as they rely on data provided by independent distributors that are not verified by the company  do not consider potential timing issues within the distribution channel  including goods in transit  and do not consider fluctuations in inventory at retail 
estimated sell through of our products from distributors to retail in increased by approximately from  and from this annual growth substantially exceeds the and growth in national instant criminal background check system nics background checks over the same periods 
this suggests the likelihood of market share gain by the company during the past two years  and was the result of the introduction of new products and increased production and shipments of legacy products 
the total number of nics background checks for the past three years follows number of nics background checks in s total nics background checks while nics background checks are not a precise measure of retail activity  they are commonly used as a proxy for retail demand 
nics background checks are performed when the ownership of most firearms  either new or used  is transferred by a federal firearms licensee 
nics background checks are also performed for permit applications  permit renewals  and other administrative reasons

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses recognized and incurred during the reporting period then ended 
the company bases estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances  and other assumptions  including those reviewed with actuarial consultants and independent counsel  when applicable  that are believed to be reasonable 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the determination of its product liability accrual is a critical accounting policy 
the company s management reviews every lawsuit and claim at the outset and is in contact with independent and corporate counsel on an ongoing basis 
the provision for product liability claims is based upon many factors  which vary for each case 
these factors include the type of claim  nature and extent of injuries  historical settlement ranges  jurisdiction where filed  and advice of counsel 
an accrual is established for each lawsuit and claim  when appropriate  based on the nature of each such lawsuit or claim 
amounts are charged to product liability expense in the period in which the company becomes aware that a claim or  in some instances a threat of claim  has been made when potential losses or costs of defense can be reasonably estimated 
such amounts are determined based on the company s experience in defending similar claims 
occasionally  charges are made for claims made in prior periods because the cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  exceed amounts already provided 
likewise  credits may be taken if cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  are less than amounts previously provided 
while it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs  in the opinion of management  after consultation with independent and corporate counsel  it is not probable and is unlikely that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but may have a material impact on the company s financial results for a particular period 
the company believes the valuation of its inventory and the related excess and obsolescence reserve is also a critical accounting policy 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost  principally determined by the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and prevailing inventory costs existing at that time 
the company determines its excess and obsolescence reserve by projecting the year in which inventory will be consumed into a finished product 
given ever changing market conditions  customer preferences and the anticipated introduction of new products  it does not seem prudent nor supportable to carry inventory at full cost beyond that needed during the next months 
therefore  the company estimates its excess and obsolescence inventory reserve based on the following parameters 
table of contents projected year required of consumption reserve and thereafter recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards codification asc formerly sfas  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles

it also modifies the gaap hierarchy to include only two levels of gaap  authoritative and non authoritative 
asc is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  therefore  the company adopted asc for reporting in our third quarter

subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the pronouncement requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
the company adopted fas during the second quarter of forward looking statements and projections the company may  from time to time  make forward looking statements and projections concerning future expectations 
such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain qualifying risks and uncertainties  such as market demand  sales levels of firearms  anticipated castings sales and earnings  the need for external financing for operations or capital expenditures  the results of pending litigation against the company including lawsuits filed by mayors  state attorneys general and other governmental entities and membership organizations  and the impact of future firearms control and environmental legislation  any one or more of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected
