item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a multi concept restaurant company headquartered in nashville  tennessee 
we own and operate three restaurant concepts under the o charley s  ninety nine and stoney river legendary steaks trade names 
as of december   we operated o charley s company owned restaurants in states in the east  southeast and midwest  ninety nine restaurants in nine states throughout new england and the mid atlantic  and stoney river restaurants in six states in the east  southeast and midwest 
as of december   we had ten franchised o charley s restaurants in five states in the east and southeast 
recent economic trends  including high rates of unemployment and declining home prices  have negatively impacted the middle income consumer who is the core customer of casual dining restaurants 
like many of our competitors  the economic environment  one of the more challenging in casual dining history  has contributed to declines in same store sales 
in response to the current economic environment  we are focused on driving profitable sales  controlling margins while enhancing guest service and maintaining our financial flexibility 
improving sales by differentiating our brands through innovative and value focused food and beverage offerings 
we are committed to serving the best food in the varied menu  upscale and casual dining segments with high value perception 
by offering unique and innovative menu items  we believe we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors  build brand loyalty and stimulate return visits 
in the current economic environment  we recognize that providing compelling value to our guests is increasingly important 
to that end  late in fiscal  our promotions featured a number of new items at attractive price points 
for example  at o charley s we expanded our two meals for from six to ten entr es and increased availability of this special to seven days a week  all of which was supported with advertising and marketing  including communications to our million member e club 
at ninety nine restaurants we added new entr es to our popular nine entr es starting at and began offering nine lunch items starting at in order to build our lunch business 
during the year we began repositioning the stoney river legendary steaks brand as an upscale casual dining restaurant by providing the same great guest experience with lower menu prices  new menu offerings  and a new menu format 
we believe that the increased guest counts at stoney river in the fourth quarter indicate the success of these repositioning elements 
we also opened a stoney river restaurant in towson  maryland which included these repositioning elements 
controlling margins while enhancing guest service 
our restaurant level margin  which we define as restaurant sales minus cost of food and beverage  payroll and benefit costs  and restaurant operating costs  increased to percent of restaurant sales from percent of restaurant sales in we believe that the roll out of our new  integrated back of house system will facilitate even greater control over labor and food expenses 
we also realized year over year savings from changes to our health care plans for our hourly team members 
we achieve these savings while guest satisfaction scores reached an all time high in each of our restaurant brands 
maintaining our financial flexibility by maximizing cash flow and reducing debt 
in the current economic environment we believe it is critical to maintain our financial flexibility 
the combination of positive operating cash flow and reduced levels of capital investment during fiscal allowed us to reduce debt and capital lease obligations by million during the year 
this reduction includes the paying off the outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit of million  million in capital lease payments  and approximately million of amortization and payments of other borrowings 
during the third quarter of fiscal we completed the transaction to outsource food and supply distribution for our ninety nine restaurants  and received net cash proceeds of approximately million 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  we entered into our third amended and restated credit agreement to enhance our financial flexibility 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to this matter 
fiscal years end on the last sunday of the calendar year 
fiscal years  and each consisted of weeks 
we have one reportable segment 
following is an explanation of certain items in our consolidated statements of operations revenues consist primarily of company operated and joint venture restaurant sales and  to a lesser extent  royalty and franchise revenue 
restaurant sales include food and beverage sales and are net of applicable state and local sales taxes and discounts 
franchise revenue and other revenue consist of development fees  royalties on sales by franchised units  and royalties on sales of branded food items  particularly salad dressings 
our development fees for franchisees in which we do not have an ownership interest are between  and  per restaurant 
the development fees are recognized during the reporting period in which the developed restaurant begins operation 
the royalties are recognized as revenue in the period corresponding to the franchisees sales 
cost of food and beverage primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages net of vendor discounts and rebates 
the three most significant commodities that may affect our cost of food and beverage are beef  poultry  and seafood which accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  of our overall cost of food and beverage in generally  temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to guests  however  in the past  we have adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature 
payroll and benefits include payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities  including restaurant management salaries  bonuses  share based compensation  k contribution match  hourly wages for restaurant level team members  payroll taxes  workers compensation  various health  life and dental insurance programs  vacation expense and sick pay

severance costs associated with the sale of the ninety nine restaurant distribution operations and the supply chain restructuring are included in the impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net line 
depreciation and amortization  property and equipment primarily includes depreciation on property and equipment calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the lease term plus one renewal term for leasehold improvements  if shorter 
based on the size of the investment that we make  the economic penalty incurred by discontinuing use of the leased facility  our historical experience with respect to the length of time a restaurant operates at a specific location  and leases that typically have multiple five year renewal options that are exercised entirely at our discretion  we have concluded that one five year renewal option is reasonably assured 
during fiscal and  this also included accelerated depreciation expenses taken on assets to be disposed of during our re branding activities 
impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net includes asset impairments  either operating or held for sale  asset disposals  gains and losses incurred upon the sale of assets  and to a lesser extent  various costs associated with restructuring our supply chain 
impairment charges are taken for land  buildings and equipment and certain other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset based upon the future highest and best use of the impaired asset 
impairment charges for assets that are held for sale represents the difference between their current book value and the estimated net sales proceeds 
disposal charges include the costs incurred to prepare the asset or assets for sale  including repair and maintenance  clean up costs  broker commissions  and independent appraisals 
gains and or losses associated with the sale of assets are also included in this category 
we evaluate restaurant closures for potential disclosure as discontinued operations based on an assessment of quantitative and qualitative factors  including the nature of the closure  potential for revenue migration to other company operated and franchised restaurants  planned market development in the area of the closed restaurant and the significance of the impact on the related consolidated financial statement line items

pre opening costs represent costs associated with our store opening teams  as well as other costs associated with opening a new restaurant 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs also include straight line rent related to leased properties from the period of time between when we have waived any contingencies regarding use of the leased property and the date on which the restaurant opens 
the amount of pre opening costs incurred in any one period includes costs incurred during the period for restaurants opened and under development 
our pre opening costs may vary significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing of restaurant development and openings 
pre opening costs also include training  supply  and other incremental costs necessary to prepare for the re opening of an existing restaurant as part of re branding or re modeling initiatives 
interest expense  net represents the sum of the following interest on our percent senior subordinated notes due the notes  interest and fees associated with our credit facility  amortization of prepaid interest and finance charges  impact of the interest rate swaps that were terminated in december  amortization of the swap exit payment  changes in the value of the assets associated with our non qualified deferred compensation plan resulting from gains and losses in the underlying funds  and interest on capital lease obligations

when computing same store sales  guest visits and average check per guest  restaurants open for at least weeks are compared from period to period for company owned restaurants 
the average check per guest is computed using all restaurants open during the year 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year overview the comparison between our financial results in and our financial results in was impacted by a number of developments in such years 
we continued to experience declines in same store sales and average weekly sales at each of our concepts due to the economic environment during fiscal during fiscal  there were impairment  disposal and restructuring charges of million and charges of million of additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  there were goodwill impairment charges of million  charges of million to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  million of impairment  disposal and restructuring charges and severance charges from organizational changes in our support centers of million 
revenues the economic environment continued to negatively impact our sales and guest counts in during  total revenues decreased million  or percent  to million from million in in  average check and guest visits decreased at all of our concepts 
we believe that the decrease in guest counts and average weekly check was due primarily to weak consumer demand caused by the current economic environment 
as consumers became more value conscious  we offered a greater variety of lower priced menu options and discounts 
we opened two company owned restaurants and closed two company owned restaurants during fiscal o charley s company operated restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  compared to million in during  same store sales for o charley s company operated restaurants declined percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent and a decline in average check of percent 
during  we did not open any new company owned o charley s restaurants  however  three former joint venture restaurants were acquired during fiscal ninety nine restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  compared to million in during  same store sales declined percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent and a decline in average check of percent 
during  we added one new restaurant and closed one ninety nine restaurant 
stoney river restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  compared to million in during  same store sales declined percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent and a decline in average check of percent 
during  we added one new restaurant and closed one stoney river restaurant 
cost of food and beverage during  our cost of food and beverage was million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared with million  or percent of restaurant sales in this basis point improvement in food and beverage cost as a percentage of restaurant sales in reflects lower commodity costs  as well as changes made to our product specifications and leveraging our theoretical food cost system  partially offset by higher discounts compared to the prior year 
payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in the increase in payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to the de leveraging impact of lower average weekly sales of basis points  partially offset by the positive impact of our labor cost management system  reduced turnover resulting in lower training expense  and reduction in the cost of our employee benefit plans of basis points 
restaurant operating costs during  restaurant operating costs were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in reductions in general liability insurance expense  employee procurement and training costs due to reduced levels of employee turnover  as well as reductions in our utility costs  resulted in a basis point improvement as a percentage of restaurant sales 
this improvement was partly offset by the de leveraging impact of reduced sales on rent and other fixed costs of basis points 
advertising and marketing expenses during  advertising and marketing expenditures were million  or percent of total revenues  compared to million  or percent of total revenues in advertising and marketing expenditures  as a percent of total revenues  were essentially flat over the same prior year period 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to percent from percent in the prior year 
this net basis point decrease in general and administrative expenses is the result of the reduction in support staffing late in  a company wide salary freeze implemented at the end of fiscal  and other reductions in spending of basis points  partly offset by increases in the value of deferred compensation from investment performance of the participant s self directed accounts of basis points 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million or percent of total revenues  as compared to million  or percent of total revenues  in this reduction in expense is primarily due to lower carrying values of assets following restaurant impairments charges recognized in the prior year  as well as reduced capital expenditures compared to the prior year 
impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net were million or percent of revenue in  compared to million or percent of revenue in in we recorded impairment charges with respect to eight o charley s restaurants  ten ninety nine restaurants and one stoney river restaurant  of which one o charley s restaurant and three ninety nine restaurants closed subsequent to the end of fiscal and we plan to close two additional ninety nine restaurants the other impaired restaurants are expected to remain open 
we also recorded additional impairment charges on the corporate airplane that we sold during fiscal and the one stoney river restaurant closed during fiscal the current economic environment  reduced consumer spending  and current negative economic outlook have reduced demand and expected future cash flow for our products  reducing the fair value of these restaurants below their carrying value 
the excess carrying value of the restaurants was recorded as an impairment charge on our statement of operations 
in we also sold our ninety nine distribution operations and recognized restructuring charges of million 
in we recorded impairment charges with respect to seven o charley s restaurants  ten ninety nine restaurants and two stoney river restaurants  of which one stoney river restaurant closed during fiscal  while the remaining impaired restaurants have remained open  as well as the corporate airplane 
the excess carrying value of the restaurants and airplane was recorded as an impairment charge on our statement of operations 
goodwill impairment due to the negative economic environment  the declining financial performance of other casual dining restaurant companies  as well as lower sales and higher commodity costs during  we believed the goodwill related to the acquisitions of the ninety nine and stoney river restaurants had indicators of impairment 
therefore  during fiscal  we tested for and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our ninety nine restaurants and million related to our stoney river restaurants 
as a result  all related goodwill was written off and accordingly was zero as of december  and december  pre opening costs during  our pre opening costs decreased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in this decrease in pre opening costs was the result of fewer new restaurant openings and the suspension of our re branding initiatives 
during fiscal we opened one new ninety nine restaurant and one new stoney river restaurant and closed one ninety nine and one stoney river restaurant 
interest expense  net our net interest expense was million or percent of total revenues in  as compared to million  or percent of total revenues in this basis point improvement is primarily due to an approximate basis point increase in earnings in the value of deferred compensation related to investment performance of the participant s self directed accounts  offset by the net reduction in interest income from swap arrangements which ended in fiscal since december   we have paid off our revolver balance of million  paid down our capital lease obligations by million  and paid down other borrowings by approximately million 
as of the end of the fiscal year we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
income taxes for we have recorded income tax expense of million  compared with million of tax expense in the prior year 
we estimate that the tax credits for  which are primarily the fica tip credits and the work opportunity tax credit wotc  will be approximately million 
included in the tax expense of million is a charge of million for recording a deferred income tax valuation allowance to offset the current year increase in deferred tax assets 
under fasb asc  income taxes fasb asc  we are required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result of the goodwill impairment charge in and the current year loss  we continue to have a three year cumulative pre tax loss in a cumulative pre tax loss is given more weight than projections of future income  and a recent historical cumulative loss is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be released in future years when we consider that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
to form a conclusion that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  we will need to periodically evaluate all available evidence  such as whether future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences  provides sufficient positive evidence to offset any potential negative evidence that may exist at such time  including our three year cumulative pre tax loss 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is released  we would record an income tax benefit for the portion or all of the deferred tax valuation allowance released 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year overview the comparison between our financial results in and our financial results in was impacted by a number of developments in such years 
goodwill impairment charges of million  charges of million to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  and severance charges from organizational changes in our support centers of million reduced our income from operations in impairment  severance  and transition charges relating to the sale of the commissary and other supply chain changes reduced our income from operations in by million 
severance  recruiting and relocation charges relating to our organizational changes reduced income from operations in by million 
the comparison between our financial results in and our financial results in was also impacted by restaurant impairment charges in both years 
during we recorded impairment charges for restaurants  of which one closed during fiscal while the remaining impaired restaurants have remained open 
these asset impairment charges reduced income from operations in by million  net of gains on related asset sales 
in comparison  during we recorded impairment charges for one restaurant that we closed and for five restaurants that have remained open 
these asset impairment charges  net of gains on related asset sales  reduced income from operations in by million 
all of these restaurant impairment charges  as well as impairment charges connected with changes in our supply chain  are reflected in impairment  disposal  and restructuring charges  net 
revenues saw a continued slow down in the us economy as consumers continued to react to declining home prices  rising unemployment  increased prices for energy and food  and turbulence in the financial markets 
these trends had a negative impact on our sales and guest counts in during  total revenues decreased million  or percent  to million from million in in  we increased average check at all of our concepts  which was more than offset by a decrease in guest visits at all of our concepts 
the increase in average check was attributable to increases in menu prices and changes in product mix 
we believe that the decrease in guest counts was due primarily to weak consumer demand caused by the current economic environment 
we had a net addition of five company owned restaurants in o charley s company operated restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  as compared to million in during  same store sales for o charley s company operated restaurants declined percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent  partially offset by an increase in average check of percent 
during  we added four new company operated o charley s restaurants and closed one company operated o charley s restaurant 
ninety nine restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  as compared to million in during  same store sales declined percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent  partially offset by an increase in average check of percent 
during  we added two new restaurants and closed one ninety nine restaurant 
stoney river restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  as compared to million in during  stoney river experienced a same store sales decrease of percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent  partially offset by an increase in average check of percent 
during  we added one new stoney river restaurant 
cost of food and beverage during  our cost of food and beverage was million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared with million  or percent of restaurant sales  in this basis point increase in food and beverage cost as a percentage of sales in reflects the impact of increased discount  promotion  and coupon activity designed to drive sales  higher costs on most food commodities specifically  beef  poultry and seafood  and higher fuel related distribution costs 
payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in the increase in payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to the de leveraging impact of the reductions in guest counts  higher employee benefit costs and higher management labor expense on a reduced sales base 
restaurant operating costs during  restaurant operating costs were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in this basis point increase  as a percentage of restaurant sales  was primarily the result of an increase in utility costs and the de leveraging impact of reduced sales on other fixed costs  such as rent 
advertising and marketing expenses during  advertising and marketing expenditures increased percent to million from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to percent from percent in this basis point increase  as a percentage of sales  was primarily attributable to our decision to increase spending at the o charley s concept in an effort to drive sales in the current economic environment  as well as the de leveraging impact of reduced sales 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to percent from percent in the prior year 
this net basis point decrease in general and administrative expense is the result of several partly offsetting items 
general and administrative expenses decreased due to changes in the value of deferred compensation from the investment performance of the participant s self directed accounts and effective spending controls  partly offset by increased share based compensation expense and severance costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million or percent of total revenues  as compared to million  or percent of total revenues  in deprecation and amortization expense was essentially flat over the same prior year period  however  as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization was higher as a result of the de leveraging impact of reduced sales 
impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net were million or percent of revenue in  compared to million or percent of revenue in in we recorded impairment charges with respect to seven o charley s restaurants  ten ninety nine restaurants and two stoney river restaurants  of which one stoney river restaurant closed during fiscal  while the remaining impaired restaurants have remained open  as well as our remaining airplane 
the economic environment  reduced consumer spending  and current negative economic outlook have reduced demand and expected future cash flow for our products  therefore  reduced the fair value of these restaurants  as well as the airplane  below their carrying value 
the excess carrying value of the restaurants and airplane was recorded as an impairment charge on our statement of operations 
in these charges included million in connection with changes in our supply chain which primarily consisted of non cash charges taken for the loss on the sale of the commissary real estate and facility and related impairment of manufacturing equipment  charges taken for employee severance and retention  and to a lesser extent  legal and transition costs 
we also recorded impairment and disposal costs of million relating to restaurant re brandings  restaurant impairments and other asset retirements during included in the million charge were the impairments related to three underperforming o charley s restaurants  two of which subsequently closed  and the impairment of one stoney river restaurant which remains open  and two ninety nine restaurants that were subsequently closed 
goodwill impairment we test goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
due to the decrease of our enterprise market value  the current economic environment  the negative financial performance of other casual dining restaurant companies  and lower sales and higher commodity costs at the ninety nine restaurants  we believed the goodwill related to the acquisition of the ninety nine restaurants was potentially impaired 
upon testing for impairment we concluded that the carrying value exceeded the fair value 
therefore  during fiscal we recognized an impairment charge of million 
we also tested the goodwill of our stoney river restaurants and recorded an impairment charge of million resulting in the write off of all of the goodwill on our balance sheet 
after these impairment charges  no goodwill remained on the balance sheet as of december  pre opening costs during  our pre opening costs increased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in this increase in pre opening costs was due primarily to an increase in the number of new store construction and re branding initiatives 
during we completed o charley s and ninety nine re brandings 
since inception of the re branding initiatives  we have completed a total of re brandings at our o charley s restaurants  and re brandings at our ninety nine restaurants 
we have suspended our re branding initiatives until economic conditions improve 
interest expense  net our net interest expense was million in  as compared to million in this change from the prior year was primarily the result of changes in the value of deferred compensation balances  million of borrowings under our credit facility  and fees  charges  and write offs of previously deferred finance costs related to third and fourth amendments to our credit facility and a reduction in our borrowing capacity 
at the end of  we did not have any borrowings under our credit facility 
income taxes for we recorded income tax expense of million  compared with million of tax benefit in the prior year 
we estimate that the tax credits for  which were primarily the fica tip credits and the work opportunity tax credit wotc  were approximately million 
included in the tax expense of million is a charge of million to establish a deferred income tax valuation allowance on substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
we are required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result of the goodwill impairment charge  we have a three year cumulative pre tax loss 
a cumulative pre tax loss is given more weight than projections of future income  and a recent historical cumulative loss is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and capital leases 
our principal capital needs have historically arisen from property and equipment additions  acquisitions  and payments on long term debt and capitalized lease obligations 
in addition  we lease a substantial number of our restaurants under operating leases and have substantial operating lease obligations 
like many restaurant companies  our working capital has historically had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to collection of our sales being received in four days or less while our typical accounts payable turnover  excluding food invoices  averages thirty days 
we do not believe this indicates a lack of liquidity 
we have slowed our restaurant development in recent years in order to focus on improving the performance of our existing restaurants and reducing our debt 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  we suspended our re branding initiatives in light of then current economic conditions 
as a result of these reductions in investment  we have increased our cash balances and  as of december   we have reduced our working capital deficit by million since the end of fiscal we opened one ninety nine restaurant and one stoney river restaurant during fiscal and did not open any company owned o charley s restaurants in fiscal we have no plans to develop any new restaurants in the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the last three years net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities decreased in from by approximately percent  or million  from million to million 
this reduction in net cash provided by operating activities is due to a million reduction in net earnings  after adjusting for non cash charges  and a million net reduction in the change in working capital and other long term assets and liabilities over the prior year 
as discussed above in the overview section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sales have been negatively impacted by economic trends resulting in lower operating income 
the remaining million decrease in net cash provided by operations is primarily due to partly offsetting changes in accounts payable and inventory 
accounts payable decreased due to reductions to credit balances with certain financial institutions  the outsourcing of our bellingham  massachusetts distribution operations during  and lower construction payables due to less construction activity at the end of as compared to partly offsetting accounts payable were reductions in inventory due to the phase out of our bellingham  massachusetts distribution operations and the use of inventory resulting from buying opportunities 
the second amended and restated credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants  including limitations on dividends  repurchases of capital stock  sale leaseback transactions  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and mergers  acquisitions and asset sales 
in addition  the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and million in letters of credit  which reduced our available borrowings under the credit agreement 
pursuant to our credit agreement  we had million in remaining capacity at december  as of the end of our fiscal year  there were no defaults under the credit agreement and we were in compliance with all covenants 
we believe that our various sources of capital  including cash flow from operating activities  availability under our credit facility  and the ability to acquire additional financing  are adequate to fund our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
as of the end of fiscal year  the balances on our revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations were million and million  respectively 
as of the end of fiscal  there were no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility and million outstanding on our capital lease obligations 
we do not expect to rely on our credit facility as a significant source of funds during fiscal year subsequent to our fiscal year end  on january  we entered into our third amended and restated credit agreement to enhance our financial flexibility 
the maximum borrowing capacity was reduced from million which was already scheduled to be reduced to million on april  to million 
the prior credit agreement had participation from nine regional and national bank organizations  while the current credit agreement has participation from three regional and national bank organizations 
the maximum adjusted leverage ratio was reduced from to 
the definitions of adjusted leverage ratio and senior secured ratio have been changed  and the growth of capital expenditures is limited to of ebitda in and of ebitda in subsequent years 
under the amended credit agreement  we are permitted to repurchase our senior subordinated notes due in  subject to certain limitations 
the amended credit agreement also reduced the number of our company owned restaurants subject to collateral mortgages from to the amended credit agreement also resets the restricted payments basket for dividends and bond repurchases  however  such payments are currently restricted by our bond indenture 
the amended credit agreement also permits sale leaseback transactions  subject to certain limitations 
in the event of a disruption or cessation of operations by one or more participants in our credit facility  rendering them unable to fund their portion of any credit facility drawings  we believe that the available capacity from the other banks in the credit facility would be sufficient to permit us to continue meeting our current obligations and funding our operating activities 
we have four separate lease agreements that cover lease arrangements for an aggregate of of our ninety nine restaurants  each of which contains a fixed charge covenant calculation 
each of the four restaurant groups are subject to an annual fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
the fixed charge coverage ratio for one of the leases  which includes six ninety nine restaurants  was to  which was below the required to minimum

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period see note to our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows lease accounting share based compensation property and equipment trademarks impairment of long lived assets income taxes lease accounting our policy for lease accounting involves recognizing rent on a straight line basis from the time we are committed to a leased property  which is when all contingencies associated with the delivery of the property by the landlord are taken care of  to the end of the lease term  generally inclusive of one renewal period 
the term  for purposes of straight line rent calculations and the useful life over which leasehold improvements are depreciated  is the shorter of the estimated useful life of the leased property or the base lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
we also recognize tenant allowances as a deferred rent liability and amortize them over the lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
based upon the size of the investment that we make at a restaurant site  the economic penalty incurred by discontinuing use of the leased facility  our historical experience with respect to the length of time a restaurant operates at a specific location  and leases that typically have multiple five year renewal options that are exercised entirely at our discretion  we have concluded that one five year renewal option is reasonably assured 
share based compensation effective december   the company adopted fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  fasb asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments including stock options 
share based compensation for fiscal years   and includes compensation expense  recognized over the applicable vesting periods for share based awards granted prior to these fiscal years  as well as awards granted during these fiscal years 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options on their grant dates 
the company s policy is to recognize compensation cost for restricted awards with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
compensation expense is recognized for only the portion of options and restricted awards that are expected to vest 
therefore  an estimated forfeiture rate derived from historical employee terminations is applied against share based compensation expense 
the forfeiture rate is applied on a straight line basis over the service vesting period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was in substance  multiple awards 
property and equipment  net the company had million of property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  at december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  and furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize all direct external costs associated with obtaining the land  building and equipment for each new restaurant  as well as construction period interest 
we also capitalize all direct external costs associated with obtaining the dining room and kitchen equipment  signage and other assets and equipment for each re branded restaurant 
in addition  for each new restaurant and re branded restaurant we also capitalize a portion of the internal direct costs of our real estate and construction department 
to determine our accounting policies related to capitalizing costs associated with our in house real estate department  we have taken guidance from fasb asc  real estate general fasb asc 
while fasb asc establishes accounting and reporting standards for the acquisition  development  construction  selling and rental costs associated with real estate projects  it excludes from its scope real estate developed by an enterprise for use in its own operations  other than for sale of rental 
given there is no other authoritative literature directly addressing our circumstance of developing real estate projects for our own operations  we have applied the principles of fasb asc in such accounting for costs 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until after the passage of time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a restaurant operates can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets 
see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the asset s use are realized 
trademarks as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
at december   we had million in indefinite lived intangible assets shown on our consolidated balance sheets related primarily to the acquisition of ninety nine restaurants 
the determination of the estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
changes in strategy  new accounting pronouncements and or market conditions may result in future impairment of recorded asset balances 
we completed a valuation of the intangibles as of december   the last day of fiscal  and our valuation showed that the fair value of the intangible asset substantially exceeded its net book value and no impairment charge was needed 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets based upon the future highest and best use of the impaired assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the cost associated with asset impairments are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the financial statement line item impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development of a given market within which a restaurant operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the restaurant efficiently and effectively 
we assess the projected cash flows and carrying values at the restaurant level  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 
in determining projected cash flow  we make key assumptions regarding sales growth  food and labor and other restaurant operating costs  as well as local market expectations 
in the event that our economic expectations are not met  estimated future cash flows could be negatively impacted  which may result in a material impairment charge 
we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in operating earnings on a timely basis 
long lived assets are tested for possible impairment each fiscal quarter 
during the year ended december   we took an impairment charge of million for eight o charley s restaurants  of which one closed subsequent to the end of fiscal  ten ninety nine restaurants  of which three closed subsequent to the end of fiscal and two stoney river restaurants  of which one closed during fiscal except for two ninety nine restaurants  the remaining impaired restaurants are expected to remain open 
the million charge in also included losses on disposal of assets  assets held for sale  and certain previously impaired restaurants 
during the year ended december   we took an impairment charge of million for seven o charley s restaurants that will remain open  ten ninety nine restaurants that will remain open and two stoney river restaurants  of which one closed during fiscal the million charge in was offset by a net gain of million on assets held for sale and assets sold or otherwise settled that were not held for sale 
during the fiscal year ended december   we incurred charges of million for fiscal in connection with changes in its supply chain which primarily consisted of non cash charges taken for the loss on the sale of the commissary real estate and facility and related impairment of manufacturing equipment  charges taken for employee severance and retention  and to a lesser extent  legal and transition costs 
in addition to the supply chain charges  we also recorded impairment and disposal costs relating to restaurant impairments and other asset retirements during fiscal of million 
included in the million charge is the impairments related to three underperforming o charley s restaurants one of which was closed while the other two o charley s restaurants have remained open and the impairment of one stoney river restaurant and two ninety nine restaurants that have remained open 
income taxes we must make estimates of certain items that comprise our income tax provision and the related current and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates include employer tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on employee tip income  work opportunity and welfare to work credits  as well as estimates related to certain depreciation and capitalization policies 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time of the provision and historical experience 
we file our income tax returns many months after our year end 
these returns are subject to audit by various federal  state and local governments several years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we are also required to perform an analysis and measure each uncertain tax position 
the analysis and measurement requires estimates and interpretations to be made 
we base these estimates upon the best available information at that time of the provision and in coordination with our interpretation of existing tax law 
as part of the computation of the income tax provision  we identify and measure deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we weigh available evidence in determining the realization of deferred tax assets 
available evidence includes historical  current and future financial performance of the company 
we also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be recognized  the deferred tax asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be released in future years when we consider that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
to form a conclusion that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  we will need to generate three year cumulative pre tax income  and we will need to periodically evaluate whether or not all available evidence  such as future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences  provides sufficient positive evidence to offset any other potential negative evidence that may exist at such time 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is released  we would record an income tax benefit for the portion or all of the deferred tax valuation allowance released 
at december   the company had a deferred tax valuation allowance of million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january   the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures asu  which adds new disclosure requirements for transfers into and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy and additional disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level fair value measurements 
this asu also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the asu is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activity on a gross basis  which is effective for the fiscal year ends beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
we do not expect this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  asu  which amends the guidance on variable interest entities in fasb asc regarding certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and modifies the methods allowed for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
in addition  asu requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
asu is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after november  and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period 
we do not expect this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land construction costs  and fuel energy costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
the federal government and several states have instituted or are considering changes to their minimum wage and or benefit related laws which  if and when enacted  could have an adverse impact on our payroll and benefit costs 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
commodity inflation has had a significant impact on our operating costs 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities and fluctuations in commodity prices 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized lease obligations and senior subordinated notes and our variable rate debt consists primarily of our credit facility 
a significant portion of our debt is at a fixed rate  therefore a one percent fluctuation in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
we purchase certain commodities such as beef  pork  poultry  seafood  produce  and dairy 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that fix the price paid for certain commodities 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature
