item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is one of the nation s largest providers of assisted living and alzheimer s memory care services 
as of december   the company operated communities in states 
fiscal in review the year was marked by a continuation of the us and global economic recession and turmoil in the financial and housing markets that began in despite these economic conditions  we continued to execute our strategic plan  which is discussed in detail under item  business business strategy  in this form k 
our business fundamentals remain solid  as evidenced by growth in same community operating income in compared to and stable occupancy 
average occupancy on a same community basis increased to in from in and increased to from on a consolidated basis 
average monthly revenue per occupied unit in increased by on a same community basis and overall compared to average monthly revenue per occupied unit on a same community basis increased from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of and overall compared to the fourth quarter of we increased the company s consolidated portfolio in by four communities  representing units 
in addition  we refinanced or extended approximately million of other debt 
looking ahead to although there is some evidence that the economic recession has ended  we cannot predict the depth and duration of current conditions or their impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
however  we continue to believe that the needs driven nature of our business  pent up demand and reduced supply of new senior housing in our sector will mitigate the economic recession as well as the effect of the weakness in the housing market 
we will continue to focus on the fundamentals of occupancy and rate growth as well as expense control 
we have spent two years implementing scalable structures and systems to better monitor and manage the company s key business drivers and believe that we are in a position to absorb additional capacity without significant changes to the company s overhead structure 
as part of our long term strategy  we intend to continue to selectively pursue potential acquisitions 
in early  we added nine additional leased communities to the company s consolidated portfolio 
in january  the company entered into the sunwest joint venture with blackstone and columbia pacific 
the purpose of the sunwest joint venture is to acquire communities currently operated by sunwest for approximately billion 
the sunwest communities proposed to be acquired by the sunwest joint venture are similar in operating characteristics to the company s existing portfolio of senior living communities 
we anticipate entering into management agreements with the sunwest joint venture to manage the portfolio of communities for a fee equal to of gross collected revenues 
while uncertainty remains concerning whether the sunwest joint venture will be the successful bidder on these properties  we currently expect the acquisition to close in the second half of see item a  risk factors  in this form k

table of contents the company s portfolio the following table sets forth a summary of the company s community property interests 
as of december  as of december  as of december  buildings units buildings units buildings units owned leased consolidated portfolio managed joint venture operated portfolio percentage increase we account for of the leased communities as operating leases and the remaining as capital leases 
we do not include the assets and liabilities of the operating lease communities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the percentage increase indicates the change from the prior year 
the total consolidated community portfolio at december   consists of the following unit types total units independent living assisted living memory care skilled nursing care operating units held for sale units taken out of service designed capacity units the units taken out of service represent rooms that have been converted for alternative uses  such as additional office space  and are not available for immediate occupancy 
the units taken out of service are excluded from the calculation of occupancy percentage 
these units are put back into service as demand dictates 

table of contents significant transactions in  and  we entered into a number of transactions that affected the number of communities we own  lease  and manage  the company s financing arrangements  and the company s capital structure 
these transactions are summarized below 
the company s most significant transaction in recent years was the merger with summerville on september   which added communities and  units to the company s leased and operated portfolio

we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay the company s charges for services from their own or family resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe that generally only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in the company s communities 
in this context  we must be sensitive to our residents financial circumstances and remain aware that rates and occupancy are interrelated 
emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued december  
table of contents in evaluating the rate component  we generally utilize the average monthly revenue per occupied unit  computed by dividing the total operating revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we generally utilize an average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units occupied during a particular period by the average number of units available during the period 
we evaluate these and other operating components for the company s consolidated portfolio  which includes the communities we own and lease  as well as for the company s total operating portfolio  which includes all of the communities we manage 
in the company s consolidated portfolio  the average monthly revenue per occupied unit increased from  in to  in and to  in the change from to represents an increase of per occupied unit  or  and the change from to represents an increase of per occupied unit  or 
these rate increases reflect a combination of factors  including local market conditions  competition  changes in level of required level of care provided to residents  acquisitions  and inflationary adjustments 
in the company s consolidated portfolio  the average occupancy rate was in  in and in the occupancy rates decreased slightly from to but increased in despite the recent general economic downturn 
we continue to evaluate the factors of rate and occupancy to find the optimum balance in each community 
since emeritus corporation s inception in  it has incurred cumulative operating losses totaling approximately million as of december  we believe that these losses have resulted from our early emphasis on expansion  financing costs arising from multiple financing and refinancing transactions related to this expansion  administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred in anticipation of further expansion and increased emphasis on risk management and financial reporting controls  the impact in the early years on many of the company s leases from capital and financing lease treatments  and occupancy rates remaining lower for longer periods than we anticipated 
while we have generally realized growth in both the company s occupancy and average monthly rates  we anticipate continued losses in the near term until such time as the company s occupancy stabilizes 
our current emphasis is on maximization of cash flows and cost containment as we work toward improvements in occupancy and average rates  selective growth  and changes in the company s capital structure  such as acquisition of leased properties and refinancing of existing debt 
emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued december

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and net loss attributable to emeritus corporation common shareholders we reported a net loss attributable to emeritus corporation common shareholders of million in compared to million in as discussed under liquidity and capital resources  the company has incurred significant losses since its inception but has generated positive cash flow from operating activities since the million decrease in net loss was primarily due to improvements in operating income from continuing operations  which increased by million to million in the current year 
the increase in operating income reflects the acquisition of communities  improvements in operating margins community revenues less community operating expenses  and a decrease in amortization expense 
interest expense increased by million  which was partially offset by a decrease in net other expenses 
the net loss for and include the following unusual or noncash items  as described below net reductions in insurance expense of million and million in and  respectively  resulting from actuarial adjustments to prior years professional liability and workers compensation reserves  loss in of million resulting from the termination of certain operating leases when we purchased the related real estate  expense in of million from costs incurred to refinance debt  including third party fees and the write off of deferred loan costs  expense of  in and million in from transaction and development related expenses  impairment losses of million and million in and  respectively  from the impairment of tangible and intangible assets and investments  gain of million in and loss of million in from the change in fair value of interest rate swaps  including amounts reported in equity earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures  depreciation and amortization decreased to million in from million in  or million  due primarily to the full amortization of resident contract costs in january  and straight line rents and amortization of above below market rents increased to million in from million in  or million  due primarily to acquisition activity 
the details of each of the components of net loss are set forth below 
total operating revenues year ended december  d d in thousands  except percentages community revenue management fees total operating revenues this increase in total community revenues is primarily due to additional revenues of million primarily related to acquisitions that occurred predominantly throughout and from expansions of existing communities 
the remaining increase in revenues from our same community portfolio is due to an increase in rates of million and an increase in occupancy contributing million

the increase in community operations expense is primarily due to an increase of million related to acquisitions and expansion projects that occurred predominantly throughout the remaining difference of million primarily resulted from same community portfolio increases in employee related expenses of million  of which million relates to salaries and wages a increase from and million relates to employee benefits 
the increase in same community employee benefits includes million in health insurance due primarily to increased enrollment  million in workers compensation expense  as further explained below  and million in sick pay benefits primarily due to a policy change 
other same community expense increases include maintenance of million and supplies of million 
we attribute the remaining increase to normal inflationary increases in other community operating expenses

of the current year s adjusted expense increase of million  million relates to new acquisitions and expansions and million to our same community portfolio 
the rate increase as a percent of payroll dollars represents our revised estimates of the ultimate exposure under the company s workers compensation programs based upon actuarial valuations and reflects an overall increase in both the frequency and severity of claims in the current year 
total professional and general liability insurance expense was million and million in and respectively  a million expense increase

table of contents the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to increases in staffing costs for regional and corporate overhead positions  including approximately million in salaries and benefits 
non cash stock compensation expenses decreased  to million in compared to million in the increase in salaries and benefits is primarily due to an increase in the number of personnel as a result of anticipated growth and increase in average salaries 
the remaining change in general and administrative expenses consisted of a decrease in professional and consulting fees of  and a net decrease of  in all other general and administrative expenses 
since of the communities we operate are managed rather than owned or leased at december   general and administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenues for all communities  including non consolidated managed communities  may be more meaningful for industry wide comparisons

we determined the fair value of the communities based on a weighting of recent offers from prospective purchasers and the income capitalization approach 
for a detailed discussion of these impairments and how they were calculated  see 
note  fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we test goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed the estimated fair value of the company 
we performed the annual impairment test as of october  and concluded that no impairment charge was required  as the estimated fair value of emeritus was substantially in excess of its carrying value 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense year ended december  d d in thousands  except percentages depreciation and amortization as percentage of revenue ppt the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense represents a decrease in depreciation expense of million and a decrease in amortization expense of million 
the decrease in depreciation expense is the result of our purchase  in  of the real estate underlying communities that we accounted for as capital leases 
we depreciate assets under capital leases over the lease terms  which are generally shorter than the useful lives 
the decrease in amortization expense is due primarily to the in place resident contract intangible asset acquired in our purchase of summerville in september we fully amortized this asset in the first quarter of  therefore  amortization expense related to this asset decreased by million from  which was offset in part by intangible assets acquired in the purchase of three communities in community leases expense year ended december  d d in thousands  except percentages operating lease expense above below market rent straight line rent community leases as percentage of revenue ppt the increase in community leases expense consisted primarily of million related to the acquisition of communities since december accounted for as operating leases

table of contents the table below shows the amounts and changes in average monthly revenue per occupied unit and occupancy rates three months ended december  d d average monthly revenue per occupied unit average occupancy rate ppt community operating expenses increased by million in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the fourth quarter of  primarily due to increases in employee related expenses of million  professional liability expenses of million  primarily from an actuarial based expense credit in the prior year fourth quarter  maintenance expenses of  and supplies expenses of  the employee related increase of million is comprised of million in salaries and wages  a increase over  a million increase in health insurance due primarily to an increase in enrollment  a million increase in workers compensation expense due to year to date expense credits of million recorded in the prior year quarter  and a million increase in vacation holiday expense

table of contents the table below shows the amounts and changes in average monthly revenue per occupied unit and occupancy rates year ended december  d d average monthly revenue per occupied unit average occupancy rate ppt community operating expenses increased by million  primarily due to increases in employee related expenses of million  maintenance expenses of million  and supplies expenses of million 
the employee related increase of million is comprised of million in salaries and wages  a increase over  a million increase in health insurance due primarily to an increase in employee enrollment  a million increase in workers compensation expense due to expense credits of million recorded in and a general increase in both frequency and severity of claims experience in  and million increase in sick pay benefits due primarily to a change in our sick pay policy

operating income after interest expense increased to million in from million in  an improvement of  as a result of the items discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources the united states economy experienced a significant decline in the housing market and a related weakness in the availability and affordability of credit during that led to the economic recession that continued throughout we believe that the slowdown in the housing market and the constriction of credit are likely to continue throughout however  we believe that need driven demand for our services continues to grow and remains resilient  in spite of the overall housing and economic concerns  as evidenced by our relative stability in occupancy and improvements in cash flows 
at december   we had cash on hand of million compared to million at december  we had working capital deficits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception 
due to the nature of our business  it is not unusual to operate in the position of a working capital deficit because we collect revenues much more quickly  often in advance  than we are required to pay obligations 
the result is a very low level of current assets to the extent cash has been deployed in business development opportunities or to pay down long term liabilities 
along those lines  the working capital deficit at december  includes a million deferred tax asset and  as part of current liabilities  million of deferred revenue and unearned rental income 
the level of current liabilities is not expected to increase from year to year in such a way as to require the use of significant cash  except for long term debt of million that matures in we intend to refinance or retire these obligations prior to their respective due dates 
given the unprecedented instability in worldwide credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such refinancing or be able to retire the obligations 
see part i  item a  risk factors recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing for development of the company s properties and other purposes  including any refinancing of the company s debt due in and  on reasonable terms and could have other adverse effects on the company and the market price of emeritus common stock 
we believe that we will be able to sustain positive cash flows from operating activities or have adequate cash reserves for all necessary operating  investing and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures through 
table of contents sources and uses of cash the following is a summary of information from the company s consolidated statements of cash flows for the three years ended december  in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year in and each of the two previous years  we reported positive net cash from operating activities in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows 
both and were positively impacted by purchasing the real estate underlying leased facilities  whereby we replaced lease payments with lower levels of debt service and also avoided future scheduled lease escalators 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in the number of current year acquisitions as compared to the two prior years 
while in we purchased three communities  in we purchased the real property underlying communities that we previously operated under lease agreements and purchased one additional community 
in  we purchased communities that we previously operated under lease agreements and eight communities previously leased by summerville and purchased one additional community 
as a result  for acquisitions of property and equipment and community acquisitions including capitalizable  routine expenditures and construction projects  we paid million in compared to million in and million in in  our net capital expenditures excluding acquisition of communities totaled million  of which million was for routine capital requirements and community refurbishments  million included in other assets  net on the consolidated balance sheet was related to the purchase of executive homes as a result of the employees relocation and the balance was for community expansion and development and corporate expenditures 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure levels  other than acquisitions  will be similar in the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was related to the decrease in acquisitions discussed above 
the acquisitions were financed in part with cash proceeds from the public offering of emeritus common stock 
proceeds from long term borrowings  net of repayments including convertible debentures  totaled million in compared to million in and million in at december   the company had payment obligations for long term debt and capital leases due in the next months totaling approximately million 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which provides a million unsecured revolving line of credit 
the credit agreement permits the company to borrow from time to time up to million on an unsecured basis 
the credit agreement also allows the company to obtain letters of credit from the lender  provided that outstanding letters of credit and any borrowings outstanding do not exceed million 
we must maintain a zero balance on advances for consecutive days during each fiscal year and a million minimum balance in cash  cash equivalents and or publicly traded marketable securities and a fixed charge coverage ratio of to there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit as of december  the agreement expires on june  
table of contents payment commitments the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  in thousands principal and lease payments due by period more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt  including current portion capital leases including current portion operating leases liability related to unrecognized tax benefits we have recognized total liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  the timing of payments related to these obligations is uncertain  however  we do not expect to pay any of this amount within the next year 
the following table summarizes interest on the company s contractual obligations at december  in thousands interest due by period more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations the amounts above do not include the company s guarantee of the mortgage debt payable to a bank by the stow jv in which emeritus has a ownership interest 
we account for the stow jv as an unconsolidated equity method investment 
as of december   the loan balance was million with variable rate interest at libor plus 
emeritus and the other member of the stow jv have each provided to the lender an unconditional guarantee of payment of this mortgage loan 
in the event that the company would be required to repay this loan  we would be entitled to recoup of such payment from the other member of the stow jv 
financial covenants and cross defaults many of the company s debt instruments  leases and corporate guarantees contain financial covenants that require that the company maintain certain financial criteria as of the end of each reporting period 
these financial covenants generally prescribe operating performance metrics such as debt or lease coverage ratios  operating income yields  fixed charge coverage ratios and or minimum occupancy requirements 
others are based on financial metrics such as minimum cash or net worth balances 
remedies available to the counterparties to these arrangements in the event of default vary but include the requirement to post a security deposit in specified amounts  acceleration of debt or lease payments  and or the termination of related lease agreements 
in addition  many of the lease and debt instruments contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations 
accordingly  an event of default could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition if a lender or landlord exercised its rights under an event of default 
as of december   the company has approximately billion of mortgage debt and notes payable outstanding comprised of the following mortgage debt financed through freddie mac and fannie mae of approximately million  or approximately of the company s total debt outstanding 
these obligations were incurred to facilitate community acquisitions over the past few years  were issued to single purpose entities spe and are secured by the assets of the spe  which consists of the real and personal property and intangible assets of a single community 
the debt is generally nonrecourse debt to the company in that only the assets or common stock of the spe are available to the lender in the event of default  with some limited exceptions 
these debt obligations do not contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants but do contain typical events of default such as nonpayment of monetary obligations  failure to maintain insurance coverage  fraud and or misrepresentation of facts  unauthorized sale or transfer of assets  and the institution of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
these debt instruments typically contain

the company guarantees generally contain requirements to maintain minimum cash and or net worth balances 
in addition  the mortgages contain other typical events of default such as nonpayment of monetary obligations  failure to maintain insurance coverage  fraud and or misrepresentation of facts  unauthorized sale or transfer of assets  and the institution of legal proceedings under bankruptcy

remedies in these events of default vary but generally include the requirement to post a security deposit in specified amounts  acceleration of lease payments  and or the termination of the related lease agreements 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements as of december  summary of critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in us reporting materially different amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our accounting policies regarding long term investments  asset impairments  self insurance reserves  income taxes  lease accounting  and stock based compensation are the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in our preparation of the company s financial statements 
those financial statements reflect our revisions to such estimates in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision became known 
a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies is contained in

impact of inflation inflation could affect the company s future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs  which accounted for approximately of revenues for the year ended december  in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
the near term negative economic outlook in the united states may impact our ability to raise prices 
in years ended december   and  respectively  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial position  revenues  income from continuing operations or cash flows 
we do not expect inflation affecting the us dollar to materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the foreseeable future 
non gaap measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial position  results of operations or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be included in most gaap measures 
in this report  we define and use the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda ebitdar  as set forth below definition of adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net loss adjusted for income or losses from discontinued operations  provision or benefit for income taxes  equity earnings or losses in unconsolidated joint ventures  noncontrolling interests  gains or losses on sale of assets  termination of leases  or investments  write off of terminated development projects costs depreciation and amortization  straight line rent and above below market rent amortization deferred move in fee revenues  impairment losses  amortization of deferred gains  non cash stock based compensation expense  interest expense  change in fair value of interest rate swaps  loan prepayment fees and debt refinancing costs  interest income  and other non cash unusual adjustments definition of adjusted ebitdar we define adjusted ebitdar as adjusted ebitda adjusted for lease expense 
management s use of adjusted ebitda ebitdar we use adjusted ebitda ebitdar to assess the company s overall financial and operating performance 
we believe these non gaap measures  as we have defined them  are useful in identifying trends in the company s performance 
table of contents because they exclude items that have little or no significance to the company s day to day operations 
these measures provide an assessment of controllable expenses and afford management the ability to make decisions  which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals  as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
these measures also provide indicators for management to determine if adjustments to current spending levels are needed 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar provide us with measures of financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as depreciation and amortization  taxation  interest expense  and lease expense associated with the company s capital structure 
these metrics measure the company s financial performance based on operational factors that management can influence in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar are some of the metrics used by senior management to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis and are used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance and value of the companies in our industry 
limitations of adjusted ebitda ebitdar adjusted ebitda ebitdar have limitations as analytical tools 
material limitations in making the adjustments to the company s losses to calculate adjusted ebitda ebitdar and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net loss includes the items excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda ebitdar generally represent income or expense items that may have a significant effect on the company s financial results  items determined to be non recurring in nature could  nevertheless  re occur in the future  and depreciation and amortization  while not directly affecting the company s current cash position  does represent wear and tear and or reduction in value of the company s properties 
if the cost to maintain the company s properties exceeds our expected routine capital expenditures  then this could affect our ability to attract and retain long term residents at the company s communities 
an investor or potential investor may find this important in evaluating the company s financial position and results of operations 
we use these non gaap measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar are not alternatives to net loss  loss from continuing operations  or cash flows provided by or used in operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda ebitdar as substitutes for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of gaap net loss to adjusted ebitda ebitdar presented below  along with the company s consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  because adjusted ebitda ebitdar are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  this measure as presented may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

table of contents the table below shows the reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda ebitdar for the three months and year ended december  and in thousands three months ended year ended december  december  net loss equity losses earnings in unconsolidated joint ventures provision for benefit of income taxes depreciation and amortization interest expense interest income non cash stock option compensation expenses amortization of deferred gains straight line rent expense above below market rent amortization deferred revenues change in fair value of interest rate swaps loss on termination of leases impairment of long lived assets and investments debt refinancing fees acquisition and development expenses discontinued operations professional and workers compensation liability adjustments adjusted ebitda community leases expense adjusted ebitdar the table below shows the reconciliation of adjusted ebitdar to cash provided by operating activities for the periods indicated in thousands three months ended year ended december  december  adjusted ebitdar provision for benefit of income taxes interest expense interest income community lease expense debt refinancing fees acquisition and development expenses cash component professional and workers compensation liability amortization of loan fees allowance for doubtful receivables changes in operating assets and liabilities  net discontinued operations cash component other net cash provided by operating activities 
table of contents cash from facility operations we define cash from facility operations cffo as follows net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for changes in operating assets and liabilities  principal amortization of capital lease obligations  recurring routine capital expenditures  and distributions to from unconsolidated joint ventures  net 
recurring routine capital expenditures include expenditures capitalized in accordance with gaap that are funded from cffo 
amounts excluded from recurring routine capital expenditures consist primarily of community acquisitions  new construction  computer hardware and software purchases  and purchases of vehicles 
management s use of cash from facility operations we use cffo to assess the company s overall liquidity 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial and liquidity goals as well as to achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
this metric measures the company s liquidity based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
cffo is one of the metrics we use along with the company s board of directors i to review our ability to service the company s outstanding indebtedness including the company s credit facilities and long term leases  ii our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve the company s communities on a period to period basis  iii for planning purposes  including preparation of the company s annual budget and iv in setting various covenants in the company s credit agreements 
these agreements generally require us to escrow or spend a minimum of between and per unit bed per year 
historically  we have spent in excess of these per unit bed amounts  however  there is no assurance that we will have funds available to escrow or spend these per unit bed amounts in the future 
if we do not escrow or spend the required minimum annual amounts  we would be in default of the applicable debt or lease agreement which could trigger cross default provisions in the company s outstanding indebtedness and lease arrangements 
limitations of cash from facility operations cffo has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of cash flows from operating activities 
cffo does not represent cash available for discretionary expenditures  since we may have mandatory debt service requirements or other non discretionary expenditures not reflected in the measure 
we believe cffo is useful to investors because it assists their ability to meaningfully evaluate our ability to service the company s outstanding indebtedness  including the company s credit facilities and capital and financing leases  and our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve the company s communities 
cffo is not an alternative to cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on cffo as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of cffo to gaap net cash provided by used in operating activities  along with the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because cffo is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the cffo measure  as presented in this report  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates due to the company s financing activities and changes in the availability of credit 
the table below provides information about the company s debt and capital lease and financing obligations  including weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of december  expected maturity date in thousands thereafter total fair value average interest rate long term debt capital lease obligations the company s results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of the company s short term and long term borrowings 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate borrowings based on monthly libor 
of this total variable rate debt  million varies with monthly libor with no libor floors or ceilings 
for every change in the monthly libor rate on this million in variable rate debt  interest expense will either increase or decrease by  as of december   the weighted average variable rate is in excess of monthly libor on million of the variable rate debt  and the monthly libor rate was 
in addition  we have variable rate debt of million that has libor floors at a weighted average floor of and a weighted average spread of  for a total weighted average rate of 
the libor floors effectively make this debt fixed rate debt as long as the monthly libor rate is less than the weighted average floor 
increases or decreases to the monthly libor rate do not change interest expense on this variable rate debt until the monthly libor rate rises above the floor  and conversely  interest expense does not decrease when the monthly libor rates falls below the floor 
this analysis does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings or operating lease obligations that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  nor does it consider actions that management might be able to take with respect to the company s financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change 
as of december   we had two interest rate swap contracts with a combined notional amount of million 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase the fair value of these swaps by approximately  and a basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease the fair value of these swap contracts by approximately 
table of contents the downturn in the united states housing market in and triggered a constriction in the availability of credit that is expected to continue in this could impact our ability to borrow money or refinance existing obligations at acceptable rates of interest 
thus far  we have experienced no significant barriers to obtaining credit
