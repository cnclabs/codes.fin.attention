average balances  including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios  are generally comprised of average daily balances 
forward looking statements the disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by important factors detailed in part i captioned forward looking statements and item a captioned risk factors of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in the report 
executive summary we produced healthy financial results in with record annual earnings of million for the year  an increase of thousand  or  from our continued focus on responsible community banking fundamentals and our strong customer relationships has led to this solid earnings growth  as well as higher deposits  a core funding source for our steady loan growth 
deposit growth in was substantial at million  or  without compromising our pricing discipline 
non interest bearing deposits totaled of total deposits at december   an increase from a year ago 
we have also expanded our franchise by opening a branch in greenbrae  california in september diluted earnings per share were for the year  compared to for the year diluted earnings per share were reduced by related to bancorp s participation and withdrawal from the tcpp and related to an fdic special assessment  respectively  as discussed later 
we are committed to actively lend with a focus in our local community 
total loans reached million at the end of  representing growth of million  or a increase from the end of prior year 
the mix of loans reflects an increase in home equity lines of credit and a decrease in construction loans as a percentage of total loans 
our focus on prudent lending standards and active management of loans have kept our loan losses to a manageable level 
non accrual loans at december  totaled million  or of bancorp s loan portfolio at december  compared to million or a year ago 
accruing loans past due to days declined to thousand at december  from million at december  net charge offs totaled million in compared to million in the charge offs in primarily relate to commercial and construction loans secured by real property where the value of collateral has declined 
recovery of the losses  if any  will depend on the value of the collateral when the property is sold 
net loans charged off in represent of average loans compared to in the pro vision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million in the allowance for loan losses of million totaled of loans and of non accrual loans at december   compared to and respectively a year ago 
on march   bancorp repurchased all  shares of outstanding preferred stock issued in december under the tcpp program 
we determined that continued participation in the tcpp was not in the best interests of our common shareholders  customers or our employees  and it would impede our ability to compete after the u 
s government s actions  interpretations  and commentary regarding various aspects of the tcpp program 
the warrant issued to the us treasury to purchase  shares of our common stock remains outstanding 
the us treasury expects to sell the warrant through auction 
after the repurchase of the preferred stock under the tcpp  we continued to grow our capital during the total risk based capital ratio for bancorp at december  totaled  exceeding industry standards for being well capitalized

table of contents bank of marin bancorp our tax equivalent net interest margin was robust at in it decreased twenty four basis points from in in a declining rate environment 
in december  the fomc brought the target interest rate to a historic low with a range of to where it remained as of december  decreases in the tax equivalent net interest margin were primarily due to the downward re pricing of the bank s loan portfolio in a declining rate environment as well as maturities and pay downs of loans with higher yields  and to a lesser extent  interest foregone on non accrual loans representing a seven basis point and a two basis point reduction to the net interest margin in and  respectively 
the largest factors likely to affect our net interest margin in will be our ability to generate loans  an increase in the federal funds target rate  which is expected to rise in late  as well as our responsiveness to competitive pricing on loans and deposits in our market 
in the current environment of historically low short term interest rates  it is imperative for us to mitigate exposure to potential increases in interest rates 
if interest rates rise  we anticipate that net interest income will rise 
the increase in interest income from asset repricing may be partially offset by deposit rate sensitivity 
in addition  it may take several upward market rate movements for variable rate loans at floors to move above the floor rates 
further  we have noticed a decrease in loan demand due to an unfavorable economic climate and intensified competition for creditworthy borrowers  all of which could impact our ability to generate profitable loans 
our efficiency ratio increased from in to in the increase reflected a thousand special assessment imposed by the fdic of five basis points on total assets minus tier capital in the second quarter of the increase also reflects a higher fdic insurance assessment rate  higher personnel and occupancy costs associated with branch expansion  operational losses  increased legal fees in connection with our participation and termination in the tcpp program  as well as legal fees associated with loans 
holding company on may   shareholders of the bank approved the formation of a bank holding company 
on july   the holding company  bank of marin bancorp  acquired the bank as its wholly owned subsidiary 
the holding company is expected to provide flexibility in meeting our financing needs and in responding to evolving changes in the banking and financial services industries 
the financial statements and discussion thereof contained in this report for periods subsequent to the reorganization relate to consolidated bancorp 
periods prior to the reorganization relate to the bank only 
the information is comparable as the sole subsidiary of bancorp is the bank 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has determined the following five accounting policies to be critical allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  share based payment  accounting for income taxes and fair value measurements 
allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses is based upon estimates of loan losses and is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge offs 
in periodic evaluations of the adequacy of the allowance balance  management considers our past loan loss experience by type of credit  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors 
we formally assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of loans based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delin quency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are reviewed as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower and or when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of default 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by outside consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by periodic examination by various bank regulatory agencies 
management monitors delinquent loans continuously and identifies problem loans to be evaluated individually for impairment testing 
for loans that are determined impaired  formal impairment measurement is performed at least quarterly on a loan by loan basis 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp our method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes specific allowances for identified problem loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  economic factors 
allowances for identified problem loans are based on specific analysis of individual credits 
loss estimation factors for loan categories are based on analysis of local economic factors applicable to each loan category 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management s best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the loan portfolio as a whole 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities at each financial statement date  we assess whether declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their costs are deemed to be other than temporary 
we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
evidence evaluated includes  but is not limited to  the remaining payment terms of the instrument and economic factors that are relevant to the collectability of the instrument  such as current prepayment speeds  the current financial condition of the issuer s  industry analyst reports  credit ratings  credit default rate s  interest rate trends and the value of any underlying collateral 
credit related other than temporary impairment results in a charge to earnings and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
non credit related other than temporary impairment results in a charge to other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes  and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
the other than temporary impairment recognized in other comprehensive income for debt securities classified as held to maturity is accreted from other comprehensive income to the amortized cost of the debt security over the remaining life of the debt security in a prospective manner on the basis of the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows 
share based payment we recognize all share based payments  including stock options and non vested restricted common shares  as an expense in the income statement based on the grant date fair value of the award with a corresponding increase to common stock 
we determine the fair value of stock options at the grant date using the black scholes pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date  the exercise price  the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior and stock price volatility based on the historical volatility of the common stock 
the estimates used in the model involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded stock based compensation expense could have been material ly different from that reflected in these financial statements 
the fair value of non vested restricted common shares generally equals the stock price at grant date 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those share based awards expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp accounting for income taxes income taxes reported in the financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach 
we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals o f deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business 
bancorp files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold  we may recognize only the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
management believes that all of our tax positions taken meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
to the extent tax authorities disagree with these tax positions  our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities 
fair value measurements we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
we base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
securities available for sale  derivatives  and loans held for sale  if any  are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis  such as certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other than temporarily impaired 
these non recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write downs of individual assets due to application of lower of cost or market accounting 
we have established and documented a process for determining fair value 
we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
whenever there is no readily available market data  management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements 
for detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

table of contents bank of marin bancorp net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is impacted by changes in general market interest rates and by changes in the amounts and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
we manage interest rate risk exposure with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on net interest margin 
net interest margin is expressed as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest earning assets and the average rate incurred on total interest bearing liabilities 
both of these measures are reported on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest margin is the higher of the two because it reflects interest income earned on assets funded with non interest bearing sources of funds  which include demand deposits and stockholders equity 
table  distribution of average statements of condition and analysis of net interest income  compares interest income and average interest earning assets with interest expense and average interest bearing liabilities for the three years  and the table also indicates net interest income  net interest margin and net interest rate spread for each period presented

yields and interest income on tax exempt securities and loans are presented on a taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory rate of percent 
average balances on loans outstanding include non performing loans  if any 
the amortized portion of net loan origination fees is included in interest income on loans  representing an adjustment to the yield 
interest income expense is divided by actual number of days in the period times days to correspond to stated interest rate terms  where applicable 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp the tax equivalent net interest margin decreased to in  down twenty four basis points from the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to the repricing of our loan portfolio in a declining rate environment  and to a lesser extent  interest foregone on non accrual loans representing a seven basis point impact on the net interest margin in versus a two basis point effect in 
in  the effect on the net interest margin of lower rates on deposits and borrowings due to sharply declining market rates outweighed the effect of lower asset yields  resulting in a thirty four basis point increase to the margin 
the net interest rate spread in is consistent with  reflecting a decrease of seventy five basis points in the yield on interest earning assets and a decline of seventy four basis points in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
in  the yield on interest earning assets declined seventy two basis points while the yield on interest earning liabilities declined dramatically by basis points  reflecting a sharply declining interest rate environment 
market rate changes have a more immediate effect on deposit rates than on loan yields due to our fixed rate loans see table below for our fixed vs 
variable loans distribution 
in addition  the large majority of our variable loans are tied to the us treasury constant maturity indices with repricing intervals between one year to five years 
market rates are in part based on the federal reserve open market committee fomc target federal funds interest rate the interest rate banks charge each other for short term borrowings 
the change in the federal funds sold and purchased rates is the result of target rate changes implemented by the fomc 
in  there were seven downward adjustments to the target rate totaling basis points  bringing the target interest rate to a historic low with a range of to where it remained as of december the overall earnings on assets are affected by loan rates and the mix of interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets increased million  or  in compared to the increase primarily relates to average loan growth of million and an increase in average investment securities of million  partially offset by a million decline in average federal funds sold 
there was no significant shift in the mix of interest earning assets in the composition of interest earning assets in compared to reflects a shift to higher yielding loans from federal funds sold 
the movement followed the sale of the indirect auto portfolio in the second quarter of when the proceeds of million were initially invested in federal funds sold and gradually reinvested in higher yielding relationship l oans 
the yield on the loan portfolio  which comprised approximately of average earning assets in and  decreased eighty five basis points in and ninety six basis points in due to the downward repricing of variable rate loans and new loans originated at lower market rates  as well as maturities and pay downs of higher yielding loans 
the yield on agency securities in decreased twenty basis points from  mainly reflecting a tighter spread between agency yields and treasury rates on newly purchased agency securities due to the stabilization of the mbs market in and increased prepayments of higher yielding securities which accelerated the amortization of premiums 
the yield on agency securities in decreased six basis points from mainly due to a lower interest rate environment 
the yield on municipal bonds increased eight basis points in and seventy five basis points in  as the yields on securities purchased were impacted by state and political subdivisions which were forced to offer higher rates when investors were wary of the credit quality of the issuer and the insurance companies who guaranteed the instruments 
the overall cost of liabilities is affected by offered rates and the mix of deposits and other liabilities 
the overall rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased seventy four basis points in over the rate on savings and money market accounts  cdars  and time deposits decreased basis points  basis points  and basis points  respectively  in compared to  reflecting lower offered rates on deposits in response to lower market rates 
the rate on purchased funds remained essentially unchanged in due to unchanged federal funds target rate and our procurement of fixed rate fhlb advances in and early the rate on purchased funds decreased basis points in over  primarily due to declines i n the federal funds target rate 
the rate on the subordinated debenture declined basis points in and basis points in due to a decline in the three month libor rate  to which the debenture rate is indexed 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in compared to the increases are pervasive in all categories of interest bearing liabilities  most notably in cdars deposits and purchased funds  which increased million and million respectively in late in the first quarter of  we began to offer a new deposit product  certificate of deposit account registry service cdars  a network through which the bank offers fdic insurance coverage in excess of the current thousand regulatory maximum by placing deposits in multiple banks participating in the network 
we have experienced a shift in the relative mix of interest bearing liabilities in compared to the proportion of higher costing liabilities mainly cdars and purchased funds has increased from of interest bearing liabilities in to in  while the proportion of money market deposit accounts has decreased from in to in page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in over  with increases recorded in most deposit categories 
notably  the increase in average savings and money market accounts of million was mainly due to a new on balance sheet cash sweep program 
cdars contributed to an increase in average deposits of million 
the increase in interest bearing liabilities in was also the result of an increase in average purchased funds of million as our loan growth outpaced the deposit growth in table  analysis of changes in net interest income  separates the change in net interest income into two components volume change caused by increases or decreases in the average asset and liability balances outstanding  and yield rate changes in average yields on earning assets and average rates for interest bearing liabilities

the unallocated change in rate or volume variance has been allocated between the rate and volume variances on a pro rata basis 
yields and interest income on tax exempt securities and loans are presented on a taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory rate of percent 
the table indicates that in  our net interest income was favorably affected by the increase in volume of interest earning assets  which outweighed the effect of declines in yields 
the decline in our asset yields in reflected our variable loans that repriced downward as their indexed rate reset 
in  the decreases in both interest income and interest expense were heavily impacted by rapid decreases in market rate  partially offset by increases related to volume

table of contents bank of marin bancorp provision for loan losses management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis based on several factors including growth of the loan portfolio  analysis of probable losses in the portfolio  recent loss experience and the current economic climate 
actual losses on loans are charged against the allowance  and the allowance is increased through the provision for loan losses charged to expense to bring the allowance to a level  based on management s best judgment  to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
for further discussion  see the section captioned critical accounting policies 
our provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million in and thousand in the increase to the provision for loan losses from the prior years reflected recent losses on specifically identified loans  increases in loan loss factors applied to certain types of loans as a result of the prevailing weaker economic conditions in recent years  as well as our loan growth 
see the section captioned allowance for loan losses below for further analysis of the provision for loan losses

excluding this nonrecurring gain  non interest income in increased thousand  or  from the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in was primarily due to the increase in the volume of deposit accounts 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in was primarily attributable to an increase in fees from our business analysis accounts  primarily reflecting a reduced earnings credit  as well as an increase in fees on checks drawn against insufficient funds effective april   combined with a higher volume of rebounded checks 
the increase in wms income in primarily reflected a higher level of assets under management 
the increase in wms income was primarily due to higher estate settlement and trustee fees  partially offset by market declines affecting fees 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp the increase in bank owned life insurance boli income is attributable to the full year s worth of income earned on the million of policies purchased in august the increase in customer banking fees in is primarily due to a k increase in visa debit fees attributable to a higher volume of visa card applications resulting from a promotion  as well as an increase in remote deposit capture fees 
the decrease in other income in is primarily due to decreases of k of dividends on fhlb stock  and the absence of thousand in interest we received in the second quarter of on amended tax returns  partially offset by k increase in net merchant card fee income due to lower i nterchange costs charged by our data processing vendor resulting from the renegotiation of our data processing contract 
the decrease in the other non interest income in was primarily due to a thousand decrease in reverse mortgage fees  an thousand decrease in net remote deposit capture fees which are offset by earnings credit through business analysis  a thousand decrease in visa fees following the sale of the visa credit card portfolio in the third quarter of  and a thousand decrease in cash manager fees when customers switched to a new on balance sheet sweep product  we no longer receive significant fees from the previous cash management reserve processor 
the decreases were partially offset by higher miscellaneous income due to thousand of interest we received in the second quarter of on amended tax returns and a thousand increase in boli income due to million new purchase of policies in the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio generated a pre tax net gain in of thousand and the sale of the visa credit card portfolio generated a pre tax net gain of thousand in  resulting in total net gains of million

the increase in salaries and benefits in from the prior year primarily reflected higher salaries related to annual merit increases  and higher commissions and employee insurance 
these increases were partially offset by a thousand decrease in our contribution to employee stock ownership and savings plan  a thousand decrease in stock based compensation and lower capitalization of deferred loan costs 
the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses in from was primarily related to higher premises rent associated with the new greenbrae branch opened in september and increases for renewed leases  as well as a full year of rent for the mill valley branch opened in june the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses in compared to was primarily related to higher premises rent associated with the new mill valley branch and increases for renewed leases  as well as higher maintenance and repair costs 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp depreciation and amortization increased slightly in and reflected amortization of the recently capitalized leasehold improvements of the greenbrae and mill valley branches  partially offset by the effect of certain assets that became fully depreciated in the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in was primarily due to the addition of leasehold improvements associated with the remodeling of the san rafael branch in the second quarter of  and the addition of the mill valley branch in june the increase in fdic insurance was due to a higher fdic assessment rate which more than doubled from last year  and higher deposits 
effective april   the fdic adopted a final rule revising its risk based insurance assessment system and effectively increasing the overall assessment rate 
the new initial base assessment rates for risk category institutions range from twelve to sixteen basis points  on an annualized basis 
the fdic also imposed a special deposit insurance assessment of five basis points on all insured institutions total assets minus tier capital at june  in order to replenish the deposit insurance fund 
as a result  we recognized thousand from this special assessment in the increase of fdic insurance in over is primarily due to an increase in the industry wide fdic assessment rate and growth in our deposit level 
in addition  in november  we elected to participate in the fdic transaction account guarantee program  which provides unlimited insurance coverage on non interest bearing transaction accounts defined by the fdic  on which we will pay a basis point surcharge per covered balances in excess of thousand through the basis point surcharge on non interest bearing transaction accounts over thousand will increase to basis points from january to june  at which time the program expires 
data processing costs decreased in over as we benefitted from the renegotiation of our contract with our data processing vendor 
the increase in data processing costs in over reflected a one time de conversion cost that related to credit card customers  as well as one time costs associated with network upgrades  set up of our new cash manager sweep program  and the related training costs 
the increase in professional services in over was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses relating to the repurchase of preferred shares as well as legal expenses relating to delinquent loans 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in other professional fees associated with the discontinuation of a consulting agreement that began in july of and ended in june of the decrease in professional services in over was largely attributable to a decrease in expenses associated with the holding company formation in and the discontinuation of the consulting agreement previously mentioned 
the increase in advertising expenses from is primarily due to fees associated with a new public relations firm 
the increase in over is mainly attributable to several new advertising campaigns and marketing research projects 
the decrease in director expense in is primarily due to the departure of two directors who retired in may the increase in other expense in over reflected operational losses in the second quarter of as well as the absence of a thousand litigation liability cost reversed in in  other expense included a pre tax non recurring charge of thousand recorded in the fourth quarter for the potential obligation to visa usa in connection with certain litigation indemnifications provided to visa usa by visa member banks 
such amount was reversed in against other expense upon visa inc s initial public offering in as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes we reported a provision for income taxes of million  million  and million for the years   and respectively 
the effective tax rates were   and for those same periods 
these provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and california franchise tax based upon reported pre tax income  and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes such as earnings on qualified municipal securities  boli and certain tax exempt loans 
therefore  there are normal fluctuations in the effective rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax 
we have not been subject to an alternative minimum tax amt during these periods

of the commercial real estate loans at december   are non owner occupied and are owner occupied 
our commercial real estate loan portfolio is weighted towards term loans for which the primary source of repayment is cash flow from net operating income of the real estate property 
the increase in commercial real estate loans in was mainly driven by increased demand from existing customers

at december   approximately of our commercial real estate loans and half of our residential real estate loans contain an interest only feature as part of the loan terms 
approximately of the interest only commercial real estate loans and of the residential real estate loans are considered to have low credit risk and are current with their payments 
see also item a  risk factors  regarding our loan concentration risk 
as of december   approximately million of our loans have interest reserves  the majority of which are construction loans 
when we determine a loan is impaired before the interest reserve has been depleted  the interest funded by the interest reserve is applied against loan principal 
as of december   million of construction loans were on non accrual status where the related interest reserves have not been depleted 
variable rate loans at their established interest rate floors or ceilings are included as fixed rate loans in the following table

table of contents bank of marin bancorp allowance for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of lending 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are charged off against the allowance 
the balance of our allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of the remaining losses inherent in the portfolio 
the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including the real estate market  changes in interest rate and economic and political environments 
based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio  management believes that the million allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfol io 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio 
the components of the allowance for loan losses as stated previously in critical accounting policies  the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance for individually identified impaired loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits with similar characteristics and trends  and an allowance for changing environmental factors 
the first component  the specific allowance  results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral  as applicable 
through management s ongoing loan grading process  individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms 
these loans are evaluated individually by management and specified allowances for loan losses are established when the discounted cash flows of future payments or collateral value of collateral dependent loans are lower than the recorded investment in the loan 
generally with problem credits that are collateral dependent  we obtain appraisals of the collateral at least annually 
we may obtain appraisals more frequently if we believe the collateral value is subject to market volatility  if a specific event has occurred to the collateral eg tentative map has been filed  or if we believe foreclosure is imminent 
impaired loan balances increased from million at december  to million at december  the specific allowance totaled thousand and thousand at december  and  respectively  as we charged off substantially all of our estimated losses related to specifically identified impaired loans as the losses are identified 
the second component  the allowance factor  is an estimate of the probable inherent losses in each loan pool stratified by major categories or loans with similar characteristics in our loan portfolio 
this analysis encompasses loan grades by pool and current general economic and business conditions 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
this analysis covers our entire loan portfolio but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above 
there are limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan every quarter 
therefore  it is possible that in the future some currently performing loans not recent ly graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
the total amount allocated for the second component is determined by applying loss estimation factors to outstanding loans 
at december  and  the allowance allocated by categories of credits totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase mainly related to increased allowance factors for land loans related to the construction of residential subdivisions  commercial quick qualifier loans and manufactured home loans  recognizing increased risk for these types of loans  as well as loan growth 
the third component of the allowance for loan losses is an economic component that is not allocated to specific loans or groups of loans  but rather is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  and economic trends 
at december  and  the general valuation allowance  including the economic component  totaled million and million  respectively 
starting in late  we witnessed financial difficulties experienced by borrowers in our market  where real estate sale prices have declined and holding periods have increased 
the us economy is still experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system  dramatic declines in the housing prices  and an increasing unemployment rate 
there have bee n significant reductions in spending by consumers and businesses 
in response to this  we have been proactive in evaluating reserve percentages for economic and other qualitative loss factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the increase to the third component of the allowance for loan losses reflected such evaluation

the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans totaled at december   compared to at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans reflect increased allowance factors for land loans related to the construction of residential subdivisions  commercial quick qualifier loans  and manufactured home loans  as well as a higher level of general valuation allowance mainly related to the prevailing weaker economic environment 
table shows the activity in the allowance for loan losses for each of the years in the five year period ended december  net charge offs totaled million in  primarily related to commercial and construction loans secured by real property where the value of collateral has declined  and to a lesser extent  personal loans and home equity loans 
our recent losses  which resulted in higher charge off ratio as seen in the following table  have stemmed primarily from the land development and single family residential construction projects in oregon and sonoma county in california  where property prices have been affected more significantly than our primary market of marin county

other assets also include net deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these deferred tax assets consist primarily of tax benefits expected to be realized in future periods related to temporary differences of allowance for loan losses  depreciation  state tax  stock based compensation and deferred compensation 
management believes these assets to be realizable due to our consistent record of earnings and the expectation that earnings will continue at a level adequate to realize such benefits 
in addition  we held million and million of fhlb stock recorded at cost in other assets at december  and  respectively 
the fhlb paid thousand in cash dividends and thousand in stock dividends in and  respectively 
on february   fhlb declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of at an annualized dividend rate of 
management does not believe that fhlb stock is other than temporary impaired as we expect to be able to redeem the stock at cost 
deposits deposits  which are used to fund our interest earning assets  increased million in recent failures in a large number of banks have led to increased customer concern over deposit safety 
we believe that we have successfully attracted new deposits due to our financial soundness  our legacy of customer service  and our focus on relationship building 
the economic downturn also appears to have impacted the general public s investment behavior  as evidenced by a national trend of increasing household savings and movement away from higher risk equity investments 
further  in march  we introduced cdars deposits  which increased from million at december  to million at december  lastly  the opening of our new greenbrae branch in september generated million in deposits in no individual customer accounted for more than of deposits 
we have experienced a slight shift in the mix of interest bearing deposits in compared to the proportion of money market deposit accounts has decreased while the proportion of cdars deposits and other time deposits have increased slightly 
we believe the shift in relative proportions is due to the low interest rate environment as time deposits accounts generally offer higher interest rates and due to customers seeking safety as cdars deposits are fully insured by the fdic

deferred compensation obligations we maintain a nonqualified  unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key management personnel 
under this plan  participating employees may defer compensation  which will entitle them to receive certain payments upon retirement  death  or disability 
the plan provides for payments for up to fifteen years commencing upon retirement and reduced benefits upon early retirement  disability  or termination of employment 
the participating employee may elect to receive payments over periods not to exceed fifteen years 
at december  and  our aggregate payment obligations under this plan totaled million and million  respectively

as permitted or required under california law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law  we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
these indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in  or not opposed to  our best interests  and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enable s us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal 
capital adequacy as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the bank s capital ratios are above regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized and bancorp s ratios exceed the required minimum ratios for capital adequacy purposes 
the bank s total risk based capital ratio decreased from at december   to at december   and bancorp s total risk based capital ratio decreased from at december   to at december  the decreases in the risk based capital ratio are primarily due to million of preferred stock we repurchased from the us treasury in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we expect to maintain strong capital levels 
our potential sources of capital include future earnings and shares issued upon the exercise of stock options 
in addition  the warrant issued under the tcpp to purchase  shares of our common stock remains outstanding 
the warrant  if exercised  would provide us with million additional tier capital 
we are also positioned to access capital markets  if necessary  for up to million through a shelf registration filed on form s in the fourth quarter of liquidity the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet both loan demand and unexpected deposit withdrawals 
we accomplish this goal by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid assets  and formal lines of credit with the fhlb  frb and correspondent banks that enable us to borrow funds as needed 
our asset liability management committee alco  which is comprised of certain directors of the bank  is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies 
management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
alco has also developed a contingency plan should liquidity drop unexpectedly below internal requirements 
we obtain funds from the repayment and maturity of loans as well as deposit inflows  investment security maturities and paydowns  federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
our primary uses of funds are the origination of loans  the purchase of investment securities  withdrawals of deposits  maturity of certificate of deposits  repayment of borrowings and dividends to stockholders 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp we must retain and attract new deposits  which depends upon the variety and effectiveness of our customer account products  service and convenience  and rates paid to customers  as well as our financial strength 
any long term decline in retail deposit funding would adversely impact our liquidity 
management does not anticipate significant reliance on federal funds purchased and fhlb advances in the near future  as our core deposit inflow has provided adequate liquidity to fund our operations 
if we were to rely on federal funds purchased or fhlb advances in the future  we expect to have the ability to post adequate collateral for such funding requirements 
as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  the sources of liquidity vary between periods 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  an increase of million over december  the primary sources of funds during included a million net increase in deposits  million in pay downs and maturities of investment securities  and million net cash provided by operating activities 
the primary uses of funds were million for investment securities purchases  million in loan originations net of principal collections  and million for the repurchase of preferred stock 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and unpledged available for sale securities maturing within one year totaled million 
the remainder of the unpledged available for sale securities portfolio of million provides additional liquidity 
these liquid assets equaled of our assets at december   compared to at december   which is in excess of our internal liquidity policy 
the increased liquidity at december  was primarily due to deposit growth exceeding loan growth  partially offset by our repurchase of million of preferred stock in the first quarter of as financial institutions continue to fail  the fdic deposit insurance fund is depleting rapidly 
therefore  the fdic has required that banks prepay their regular insurance premiums for the next three years in december our cash and cash equivalents were reduced by approximately million in december due to the prepayment 
see also discussion captioned other assets above 
we anticipate that cash and cash equivalents on hand and other sources of funds will provide adequate liquidity for our operating  investing our overnight borrowing rates and financing needs and our regulatory liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
management monitors our liquidity position daily  balancing loan funding payments with changes in deposit activity and overnight investments 
our emphasis on local deposits combined with our equity to assets ratio  provides a very stable funding base 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we have substantial additional borrowing capacity including unsecured lines of credit totaling million with correspondent banks 
further  on march   we pledged a certain residential loan portfolio that increased our borrowing capacity with the frb  which curren tly totals million 
as of december   there is no debt outstanding to correspondent banks or the frb 
we are also a member of the fhlb and have a line of credit secured under terms of a blanket collateral agreement by a pledge of essentially all of our financial assets in the amount of million  of which million was available at december  borrowings under the line are limited to eligible collateral 
the interest rates on overnight borrowings with both correspondent banks and the fhlb are determined daily 
the overnight borrowing rate generally approximates the federal funds target rate  which remained constant throughout however  due to market volatility  our overnight borrowing rates ranged from to in undisbursed loan commitments  which are not reflected on the consolidated statement of condition  totaled million at december  at rates ranging from to 
this amount included million under commercial lines of credit these commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards  million under revolving home equity lines  million under undisbursed construction loans  million under personal and other lines of credit  and a remaining million under standby letters of credit 
these commitments  to the extent used  are expected to be funded primarily through the repayment of existing loans  deposit growth and existing balance sheet liquidity 
over the next twelve months million of time deposits will mature 
we expect these funds to be replaced with new time or savings accounts 
since bancorp is a holding company and does not conduct regular banking operations  its primary sources of liquidity are dividends from the bank 
under the california financial code  payment of a dividend from the bank to bancorp is restricted to the lesser of the bank s retained earnings or the amount of the bank s undistributed net profits from the previous three fiscal years 
as the bank made a million distribution to bancorp in march in connection with bancorp s repurchase of preferred stock  distributions from the bank to bancorp will be subject to advance regulatory approval for three years beginning in the primary uses of funds for bancorp are stockholder dividends and ordinary operating expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  the bank paid a million dividend to bancorp to cover bancorp s operation al needs and cash dividends to shareholders for the near future 
management anticipates that there will be sufficient earnings at the bank level to provide dividends to bancorp to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future

table of contents bank of marin bancorp item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the risk is inherent in our deposit and lending activities 
management  together with alco  has sought to manage rate sensitivity and maturities of assets and liabilities to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
additionally  interest rate risk exposure is managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on our net interest margin 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
interest rate risk exposure is managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on the net interest margin 
activities in asset and liability management include  but are not limited to  lending  borrowing  accepting deposits and investing in securities 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset and liability management 
sensitivity of net interest income nii to interest rate changes results from differences in the maturity or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of our assets and liabilities is managed with the objective of correlating the movements of interest rates on loans and investments with those of deposits and borrowings 
the asset and liability policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of change to nii in changing interest rate environments 
we use simulation models to forecast nii 
exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by the alco and the board of directors 
they utilize interest rate sensitivity simulation models as a tool for achieving these objectives and for developing ways in which to improve profitability 
a simplified statement of condition is prepared on a quarterly basis as a starting point  using as inputs  actual loans  investments  borrowings and deposits 
if potential changes to net equity value and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest changes are not within the limits established by the board of directors  management may adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within approved limits 
in the following simulation of nii under various interest rate scenarios  the simplified statement of condition is processed against four interest rate change scenarios  in basis point increments 
as the federal funds target rate at december  was already at its historic low of  it is unlikely that there will be further reductions in the target rate 
therefore  a reduction in rate scenario is not considered in the following table at december  each of these scenarios assumes that the change in interest rates is immediate and interest rates remain at the new levels 
table summarizes the effect on nii due to changing interest rates as measured against the flat rate scenario 
table effect of interest rate change on net interest income at december  changes in interest estimated change in nii rates in basis points as percent of nii up up up up the above table estimates the impact of interest rate changes 
the estimated changes are within our policy guidelines established by alco 
the table indicates that at december   we were asset sensitive in a rising interest rate environment 
the results shown reflect a lag in the upward re pricing of loans due to loans on floors 
we have mitigated earnings sensitivity somewhat through the procurement of fixed rate borrowings 
from time to time  we enter into certain interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the changes in the fair value of specified long term fixed rate loans and firm commitments to enter into long term fixed rate loans caused by changes in interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp as with any simulation model or other method of measuring interest rate risk  certain limitations are inherent in the process 
for example  although certain of our assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing time frames  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the changes in interest rates on certain categories of either our assets or liabilities may precede or lag changes in market interest rates 
also  the actual rates and timing of prepayments on loans and investment securities could vary significantly from the assumptions used in the various scenarios 
further  changes in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the yield curve could produce different results from those presented in the table 
accordingly  the results presented should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
one aspect is the time frame within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates at repricing or maturity 
an analysis of the repricing time frames is called a gap analysis because it shows the gap between the amounts of assets and liabilities repricing in each of several periods of time 
another aspect is the relative magnitude of the repricing for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability given various changes in market rates 
gap analysis gives no indication of the relative magnitude of repricing 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of change in market rates 
inter est rate sensitivity gaps are calculated as the difference between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing during various time periods 
table shows our repricing gaps as of december  due to the limitations of gap analysis  as described above  we do not generally use it in managing interest rate risk 
instead we rely on the more sophisticated simulation model described above as the primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk
