seasonality sales of our products tend to be seasonal  with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for higher unit sales of our products than the first and fourth quarters 
in a typical year  we earn more than percent of our annual operating income during the second and third quarters of the year 
sales in europe tend to experience more seasonality than those in north america due  in part  to a higher sensitivity of european consumption to weather conditions

raw materials and other supplies we purchase syrups and concentrates from tccc and other licensors to manufacture products 
in addition  we purchase sweeteners  juices  mineral waters  finished product  carbon dioxide  fuel  pet plastic preforms  glass  aluminum  and plastic bottles  aluminum and steel cans  pouches  closures  post mix fountain syrup packaging  and other packaging materials 
we generally purchase our raw materials  other than concentrates  syrups  mineral waters  and sweeteners  from multiple suppliers 
the beverage agreements with tccc provide that all authorized containers  closures  cases  cartons and other packages  and labels for the products of tccc must be purchased from manufacturers approved by tccc 
in the us and canada  high fructose corn syrup hfcs is the principal sweetener for beverage products of tccc and other licensors brands other than low calorie products 
sugar sucrose is also used as a sweetener in canada 
during  substantially all of our requirements for sweeteners in the us were supplied through purchases by us from tccc 
in europe  the principal sweetener is sugar derived from sugar beets 
our sugar purchases in europe are made from multiple suppliers 
we do not separately purchase low calorie sweeteners because sweeteners for low calorie beverage products are contained in the syrups or concentrates that we purchase 
we currently purchase most of our requirements for plastic bottles in north america from manufacturers jointly owned by us and other coca cola bottlers 
in europe  we produce most of our plastic bottle requirements using preforms purchased from multiple suppliers 
we believe that ownership interests in certain suppliers  participation in cooperatives  and the self manufacture of certain packages serve to ensure supply and to reduce or manage our costs 
together with all other bottlers of coca cola in the us  we are a member of the coca cola bottler s sales and services company llc ccbss 
ccbss combines the purchasing volumes for goods and supplies of multiple coca cola bottlers to achieve efficiencies in purchasing 
ccbss also participates in procurement activities with other large coca cola bottlers worldwide 
we  along with tccc and other bottlers  continue to study ways to make supply chain procedures more efficient and effective 
for example  in late  we and tccc formed coca cola supply llc to integrate our supply chains and consolidate common supply chain activities in north america  including infrastructure planning  sourcing  production planning  and transportation 
we do not use any materials or supplies that are currently in short supply  although the supply and price of specific materials or supplies are  at times  adversely affected by strikes  weather conditions  speculation  abnormally high demand  governmental controls  national emergencies  and price or supply fluctuations of their raw material components 
advertising and marketing we rely extensively on advertising and sales promotions in marketing our products 
tccc and other licensors that supply concentrates  syrups  and finished products to us make advertising expenditures in all major media to promote sales in the local areas we serve 
we also benefit from national advertising programs conducted by tccc and other licensors 
certain of the advertising expenditures by tccc and other licensors are made pursuant to annual arrangements 
we and tccc engage in a variety of marketing programs to promote the sale of products of tccc in territories in which we operate 
the amounts to be paid to us by tccc under the programs are determined annually and are periodically reassessed as the programs progress 
marketing support funding programs granted to us by tccc provide financial support  principally based on our product sales or upon the completion of stated requirements  to offset a portion of our costs of the joint marketing programs 
except in certain limited circumstances  tccc has no contractual obligation to participate in expenditures for advertising  marketing  and other support 
the amounts paid by tccc  and the terms of similar programs tccc may have with other licensees could differ from our arrangements 

table of contents global marketing fund we and tccc have established a global marketing fund  under which tccc pays us million annually through december   as support for marketing activities 
the term of the agreement will automatically be extended for successive year periods thereafter unless either party gives written notice to terminate the agreement 
we earn annual funding under this agreement if we and tccc agree on an annual marketing and business plan 
tccc may terminate this agreement for the balance of any year in which we fail to timely complete the marketing plans or are unable to execute the elements of those plans  when such failure is within our reasonable control
