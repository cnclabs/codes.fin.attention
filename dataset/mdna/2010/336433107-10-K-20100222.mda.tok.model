page item a risk factors an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following information  together with the other information in this annual report on form k  before buying shares of our stock 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 
risks related to our markets and customers if photovoltaic technology is not suitable for widespread adoption  or if sufficient demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate  our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 
the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which solar modules will be widely adopted is uncertain 
if photovoltaic technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption or if demand for solar modules fails to develop sufficiently  we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability 
in addition  demand for solar modules in our targeted markets including germany  italy  spain  france  the united states  canada  china and australia may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate 
many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of photovoltaic technology and demand for solar modules  including the following cost effectiveness of the electricity generated by photovoltaic power systems compared to conventional energy sources and products  including conventional energy sources  such as natural gas  and other non solar renewable energy sources  such as wind  availability and substance of government subsidies  incentives and renewable portfolio standards to support the development of the solar energy industry  performance and reliability of pv systems and thin film technology compared to conventional and other non solar renewable energy sources and products  success of other renewable energy generation technologies  such as hydroelectric  tidal  wind  geothermal  solar thermal  concentrated photovoltaic  and biomass  fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the price of  and demand for  conventional and non solar renewable energy sources  such as increases or decreases in the price of oil  natural gas and other fossil fuels  and fluctuations in capital expenditures by end users of solar modules  which tend to decrease when the economy slows and interest rates increase 
reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination or expiration of government subsidies  economic incentives and other support for on grid solar electricity applications  including the anticipated feed in tariff reductions in germany and certain other core markets  could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules  and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results 
we believe that the near term growth of the market for on grid applications  where solar energy is used to supplement the electricity a consumer purchases from the utility network  depends significantly on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives 
federal  state and local governmental bodies in many countries  most notably germany  italy  spain  france  the united states  canada  china  india  australia  greece and portugal have provided subsidies in the form of feed in tariffs  rebates  tax incentives and other incentives to end users  distributors  systems integrators and manufacturers of photovoltaic products 
many of these jurisdictions  including the majority of us states and numerous european union countries  have adopted renewable portfolio standards in which the government requires jurisdictions or regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from specified sources of renewable energy  such as solar  wind and hydroelectric power 
many of these government incentives expire  phase out over time  require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended 
a summary of recent developments in the major government subsidy programs in our core markets follows 
we expect the feed in tariff in germany and certain other core markets to be reduced earlier than previously expected  and such reductions could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules  lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 
german feed in tariffs will be adjusted earlier than previously expected  and any downwards adjustment could reduce demand for our solar modules  lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 
currently  germany  which accounted for approximately of our net sales in  is the largest market for our modules  and thus recently proposed changes to german feed in tariffs could significantly impact our results of operations 
a reduction in the pv feed in tariff is currently under discussion and will most likely come into effect in the second or third quarter of the amount of the fit reductions are expected to vary among roof mounted applications  non agricultural land free field applications and agricultural land free field applications 
a significant reduction in the fit for agricultural land free field applications in particular would likely cause a significant decline in demand for pv solar systems on agricultural land in germany and contribute to a migration toward roof mounted applications and non agricultural land free field applications 
overall  reductions in the german feed in tariffs  including any potential further reductions  could result in a significant decline in demand and price levels for photovoltaic products in germany  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
page in france  a new decree effective january provides for lower feed in tariffs for all applications including  as in germany  varying reductions for rooftop applications and free field applications while introducing  among other things  a departmental bonus which makes free field projects in the northern regions of france more attractive 
the new decree does not have an expiry date  but can be amended at any time 
in italy  the current legislation provides that the existing feed in tariff will be in effect until the expiration of a month transition period that will begin once gw of photovoltaic systems are installed under the existing feed in tariff 
it is expected that the italian government will propose and enact a new feed in tariff before the end of current proposals reflect significant fit reductions  particularly for ground mounted applications 
we cannot be certain of the level of such new feed in tariff 
if the level of such feed in tariff is not adequate to promote the development of the pv industry or pv projects in italy  our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in italy would be adversely affected 
in spain  the current legislation is scheduled to be reviewed by january   however  an earlier fit adjustment is possible 
in the united states  california has been the state where the majority of solar installations and solar power module and system sales have taken place during the past five years 
the state of california s rps goal of of electricity from renewable sources by  currently in the form of an executive order from the governor s office  is the most significant rps program in the united states in magnitude and is contributing to the expansion of the utility scale solar systems market in that state 
however  the continued effectiveness of this rps program could be negatively impacted if the rps goal is not passed by the ca legislature and signed into law 
see item a risk factors our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in california beyond existing projects may be adversely affected if california is unable to achieve a renewable mandate through law below 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of provides for certain measures intended to benefit on grid solar electricity generation and other renewable energy initiatives  including a cash grant in lieu of the federal investment tax credit for solar installations that are placed into service during and or that begin construction prior to december  and are placed into service by january   and a bonus depreciation for installations placed in service during various legislation has been proposed to extend or enhance the grant in lieu of the tax credit as well as bonus depreciation 
however  enactment of the extension or enhancement of such incentives is highly uncertain 
the failure to extend or enhance these programs may reduce tax equity availability in the case of the grant expiration which may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utility scale projects and may otherwise adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 
in ontario  canada  a new feed in tariff program was introduced in september and replaced the renewable energy standard offer program resop as the primary subsidy program for future renewable energy projects 
in order to participate in the ontario feed in tariff program  certain provisions relating to minimum required domestic content and land use restrictions for solar installations must be satisfied 
the new domestic content and land restriction rules do not apply to our sarnia solar project and the other projects governed by resop contracts that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of the solar power project development business of optisolar inc in april however  our ontario projects in earlier stages of development that are not governed by resop contracts  as well as any potential new projects in ontario  will be subject to such domestic content and land restriction rules 
as these rules are currently written  we will be unable to fully satisfy such rules in particular the domestic content requirement rules  thus projects incorporating our modules will not qualify for the ontario feed in tariff 
in the event the ontario domestic content and land use restriction rules are not sufficiently modified  our ability to participate in the ontario feed in tariff program for future projects will be substantially reduced and possibly completely eliminated  and thus our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in ontario  canada beyond our existing resop projects would be adversely affected 
in china  governmental authorities have not adopted a feed in tariff policy and currently award solar projects through either a project tendering process or bi lateral negotiations 
while the solar industry generally anticipates that china will adopt a solar feed in tariff  there is no guarantee this will occur in a timely manner or at all or that any feed in tariff will be economically viable 
without a feed in tariff  the size and attractiveness of china s solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell into china at an attractive price  limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 
in australia  the large scale solar industry is in its infancy  and despite several encouraging government funded initiatives to promote large scale solar generation  it is uncertain whether such programs can be successfully executed 
in  india announced its national solar mission  which includes a goal of installing gw of solar by india is expected to announce a feed in tariff for the first phase of the national solar mission in there is no guarantee that india will maintain its current gw by goal or adopt the required policies to meet that goal  without which  the size and attractiveness of india s solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell modules or systems in india at an attractive price  limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 
emerging subsidy programs may require an extended period of time to attain effectiveness because the applicable permitting and grid connection processes associated with these programs can be lengthy and administratively burdensome 
page in addition  if any of these statutes or regulations is found to be unconstitutional  or is reduced or discontinued for other reasons  sales prices and or volumes of our solar modules in these countries could decline significantly  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
electric utility companies or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other renewable energy sources could also lobby for a change in the relevant legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams 
reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for on grid solar energy applications  especially those in our target markets  could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in california beyond existing projects may be adversely affected if california is unable to achieve a renewable mandate through law 
california currently requires its investor owned utilities ious to procure of their electricity supplies through eligible renewable energy resources by in addition  california  through executive order has established a utility procurement goal of renewable electricity by due to the threat of penalties under the current law  investor owned utilities have the incentive to comply and have therefore signed long term contracts to meet the procurement requirement 
however  since the procurement of renewable electricity by goal is not enforceable through law  it is conceivable that renewable energy procurement in california could peak around of the iou s electricity retail sales in if the state legislature and governor s office are unable to adopt legislation that could be signed into law by the end of  the viability of the rps program would remain at risk 
california s current financial difficulties could contribute to an environment in which the rps program could be questioned 
in addition  any weakening or delay of the rps program could contribute to  or be accompanied by  increased project execution risks  delay  or costs relating to california authorities  such as the california independent system operator 
under such a scenario  our ability to execute a long term expansion plan to develop additional large scale pv projects in california could be adversely affected 
an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for end users to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules and or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for photovoltaic modules 
many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop  build and purchase a pv system 
as a result  an increase in interest rates or lending rates could make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop  build  purchase or install a pv system on favorable terms  or at all  and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales 
due to the overall economic outlook  our end users may change their decision or change the timing of their decision to develop  build  purchase or install a pv system 
in addition  we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install pv systems as an investment  funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt 
an increase in interest rates and or lending rates could lower an investor s return on investment in a pv system  increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems  and  in each case  could cause these end users to seek alternative investments 
a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing and thus lower demand for solar modules 
as described above under item business sales and marketing economic incentives  the grant in lieu of the federal investment tax credit under the arra is set to expire and unless extended  will not be available for solar installations that begin construction on or after january  if such program is not extended  total tax equity availability could be reduced which may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utility scale projects and may adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 
we currently sell a substantial portion of our solar modules under long term supply contracts  and we allocate a significant amount of our production to satisfy our obligations under these contracts 
these customers buy our modules with the expectation that they will be able to resell them in connection with the development of pv systems 
as discussed above  many of these projects depend on the availability of debt and equity financing 
a prolonged  material disruption to the supply of project finance could adversely affect our customers ability to perform under these agreements 
in the event of default by one or more of these customers  we may be unable to sell these modules at the prices specified in our long term supply contracts  especially if demand for pv systems softens or supply of solar modules increases 
also  we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to changes in economic circumstances of our customers  their end markets or the capital markets 
see item business segment information components business customers for a description of previous pricing adjustments under our long term supply contracts 
page we currently depend on a limited number of customers  with five customers accounting for a majority of our components business net sales last year 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in orders from  any of these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our operating results 
we currently sell substantially all of our solar modules to customers headquartered throughout the european union 
during  our five largest customers for our components business each accounted for between and of our component business net sales 
our customer base within our components business is currently concentrated to a significant extent in germany  and therefore the likely additional german feed in tariff reductions currently under discussion could reduce demand and or price levels for our modules sold to these customers 
the loss of any of our large customers  their inability to perform under their contracts  or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 
our customers face significant challenges under current economic conditions  including lack of capital to finance solar projects and rising costs associated with leasing or otherwise acquiring land and rooftops for solar projects 
we believe that we can mitigate this risk by re allocating modules to other customers if the need arises  but we may be unable  in whole or in part  to mitigate the reduced demand for our modules 
in the event that we determine that our planned production of solar modules exceeds the demand we anticipate  we may decide to reduce or halt production of solar modules in our manufacturing facilities 
however  we may be unable to anticipate and respond to the oversupply of solar modules because we have limited visibility into our customers inventories 
risks related to regulations existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical  regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of photovoltaic products  which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 
the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign  federal  state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry  as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities 
these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer owned electricity generation 
in the united states and in a number of other countries  these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future 
these regulations and policies could deter end user purchases of photovoltaic products and investment in the research and development of photovoltaic technology 
for example  without a mandated regulatory exception for photovoltaic systems  utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid 
if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv systems  it is likely that they would increase the cost to our end users of using pv systems which could make them less desirable  thereby harming our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  electricity generated by pv systems mostly competes with expensive peak hour electricity  rather than the less expensive average price of electricity 
modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities  such as to a flat rate for all times of the day  would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources 
we anticipate that our solar modules and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes  safety  environmental protection  utility interconnection and metering and related matters 
it is difficult to track the requirements of individual states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards 
any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us  our resellers and their customers and  as a result  could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar modules 
environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition  cash flows and profitability 
our operations involve the use  handling  generation  processing  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national  state  local and international level 
these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the use  management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines  penalties  criminal proceedings  third party property damage or personal injury claims  cleanup costs or other costs 
while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements  future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies  the implementation of new  more stringent laws and regulations  or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
page in addition  our products contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide 
elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure 
although the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium  the chemical  physical and toxicological properties of cadmium telluride have not been thoroughly investigated and reported 
we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures  including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators  chemical goggles and protective clothing 
in addition  we believe the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our end products is limited by the fully encapsulated nature of these materials in our products  the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the implementation in of our collection and recycling program for our solar modules 
while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates  end users and the general public from cadmium exposure  we cannot assure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur 
any such exposure could result in future third party claims against us  as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products  which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products 
the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the use of cadmium in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation 
future regulation in this area could impact the manufacture  sale  collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products 
for example  european union directive ec on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive  restricts the use of certain hazardous substances  including cadmium  in specified products 
other jurisdictions  such as china have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so 
currently  pv solar modules are not subject to the rohs directive  however  the rohs directive allows for future amendments subjecting additional products to the requirements and the scope 
applicability and the products included in the directive may also change 
in december  the european commission issued its proposed revision of the rohs directive 
this proposed revision did not include photovoltaic solar modules in the scope of rohs  but is now being amended by both the european parliament and the european union members states as part of the normal european union legislative process 
the european council and the european parliament are currently considering an open scope approach to the rohs directive under which all electrical and electronic equipment eee products would be included in the scope of the rohs directive unless specifically excluded or exempted from coverage 
as part of these discussions  exclusion for pv panels from the rohs directive is being considered 
a final legislative agreement on the rohs directive is not expected until at the earliest 
if pv modules are included in the scope of rohs without an exemption or exclusion  we would be required to redesign our solar modules to eliminate cadmium in order to continue to offer them for sale within the european union  which would be impractical 
in such event  the european union market would be in effect closed to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in  of our total net sales were generated from module sales in the european union 
in addition  some of our competitors are increasingly focusing on our modules use of cadmium telluride in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage over us 
if such actions are successful  they could result in a loss of sales and potentially limit our growth 
risks related to our operations  manufacturing and technology our limited operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 
we have a limited operating history 
although we began developing our predecessor technology in  we did not launch commercial operations until we qualified our pilot production line in january we qualified the first production line at our ohio plant in november  the second and third production lines at our ohio plant in august  our german plant in the third quarter of  and our malaysian plants in and because these production lines have only been in operation for a limited period of time  our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business  financial performance and prospects 
while our net sales grew from million in to billion in  we may be unable to achieve similar growth  or grow at all  in future periods 
our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions 
our past results occurred in an environment where  among other things  capital was generally more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain core markets such as the german feed in tariff were more favorable 
accordingly  you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 
see item business segment information components business customers for a description of previous pricing adjustments under our long term supply contracts 
we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules  thin film solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic systems  if global supply exceeds global demand  it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for photovoltaic modules 
the solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry 
within the global photovoltaic industry  we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers  other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies 
page even if demand for solar modules continues to grow  the rapid expansion plans of many solar cell and module manufacturers could create periods where supply exceeds demand 
in addition  we believe the significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock will provide significant reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules  including in key markets such as germany and spain 
during any such period  our competitors could decide to reduce their sales price in response to competition  even below their manufacturing cost  in order to generate sales 
as a result  we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices  or for a profit  during any period of excess supply of solar modules  which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
also  we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 
thin film technology has a short history and our thin film technology and solar modules may perform below expectations  problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses  damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 
researchers began developing thin film semiconductor technology over years ago  but were unable to integrate the technology into a solar module production line until recently 
our oldest active production line has been in operation since november  and the oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot line have been in use since as a result  our thin film technology and solar modules do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how our solar modules will perform over their estimated year useful life 
we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions 
however  if our thin film technology and solar modules perform below expectations  we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 
our solar modules are sold with a five year materials and workmanship warranty for technical defects and a year warranty against declines of more than of their initial rated power in the first years following their installation and of initial rated power in the following years  respectively 
as a result  we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 
as of december   our accrued warranty liability was million  of which  million was classified as current and million was classified as noncurrent 
while our power output warranty extends for years  our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since because of the limited operating history of our solar modules  we have been required to make assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our solar modules 
our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our solar modules  causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future 
for example  our glass on glass solar modules could break  delaminate or experience power degradation in excess of expectations  our manufacturing operations could be subject to process variations that could cause affected modules to underperform compared to our expectations 
any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and cause our sales to decline and require us to repair or replace the defective modules  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling our solar modules are incorrect  we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 
we pre fund our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling our solar modules based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the modules  which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport  the cost of freight from the solar module s installation site to a recycling center  the material  labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling 
we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled 
if our estimates prove incorrect  we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or end users return their solar modules  which could harm our operating results 
in addition  our end users can return their solar modules at any time 
as a result  we could be required to collect and recycle our solar modules earlier than we expect and before recycling technologies and processes improve 
page our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved photovoltaic products could render our solar modules uncompetitive or obsolete and reduce our net sales and market share 
we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiency and to otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry 
however  research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results 
we seek to continuously improve our products and processes  and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays  additional costs or other unintended contingencies 
in addition  our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits 
other companies are developing a variety of competing photovoltaic technologies  including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon  which could produce solar modules that prove more cost effective or have better performance than our solar modules 
in addition  other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems  or offers other value added improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners  in which case such companies could compete with us even if the levelized cost of electricity associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems 
as a result  our solar modules may be rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors  which could reduce our net sales and market share 
in addition  we often forward price our products and services including through our long term supply contracts and power purchase agreements in anticipation of future cost reductions  and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our long term cost reduction objectives could adversely affect our margins and operating results 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods and other technology is critical to our business 
failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies 
we rely primarily on patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property 
as of december   we held patents in the united states  which will expire at various times between and  and had patent applications pending 
we also held patents and had over patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions 
our existing patents and future patents could be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  or if patents are issued to us  such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise  continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property  such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise 
adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise 
in addition  others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means 
the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes  equipment  technology  trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise  methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations 
in some countries we have not applied for patent  trademark or copyright protection 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive 
also  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor 
such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business 
an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business  prospects and reputation 
in addition  we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 
page many of our key raw materials and components are either sole sourced or sourced by a limited number of third party suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 
our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost 
many of our key raw materials and components are either sole sourced or sourced by a limited number of third party suppliers 
as a result  the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations 
in addition  many of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we implement our planned rapid expansion 
we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms 
raw materials and components from new suppliers may also be less suited for our technology and yield solar modules with lower conversion efficiencies  higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules manufactured with the raw materials from our current suppliers 
a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our obligations under our long term supply contracts  which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 
a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride  our semiconductor material  could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules 
a key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound 
tellurium is mainly produced as a by product of copper refining  and its supply is therefore largely dependent upon demand for copper 
currently  we purchase these raw materials from a limited number of suppliers 
if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to perform under their contracts or purchase orders  our operations could be interrupted or impaired 
in addition  because our suppliers must undergo a lengthy qualification process  we may be unable to replace a lost supplier in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms 
our supply of cadmium telluride could also be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices 
if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride  supply could be reduced and prices could increase 
if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium  they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts 
we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts 
a reduction in our production could result in our inability to meet our commitments under our long term supply contracts  all of which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 
our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a cost effective manner  both of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
our future success depends on our ability to significantly increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput in a cost effective and efficient manner 
if we cannot do so  we may be unable to expand our business  decrease our cost per watt  maintain our competitive position  satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability 
our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including the following making changes to our production process that are not properly qualified or that may cause problems with the quality of our solar modules  delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors  many of which may be beyond our control  such as our inability to secure successful contracts with equipment vendors  our custom built equipment taking longer and costing more to manufacture than expected and not operating as designed  delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities  being unable to hire qualified staff  failure to execute our expansion plans effectively  and manufacturing concentration risk resulting from an expected out of announced production lines worldwide by the end of being located in one geographic area  malaysia 
page if our future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair our growth plans  if our future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines  our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 
currently  our production lines have a limited history of operating at full capacity 
future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower efficiencies  higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines  and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 
although we will be using the same systematic replication process to build our french manufacturing center and expand our malaysian manufacturing center that we successfully used when building and expanding our existing german and malaysian production facilities  our replication risk in connection with building production lines at our french manufacturing center and other future manufacturing plants could be higher than our replication risk was in building and expanding our existing german and malaysian production facilities because two of these new production lines are located in a new geographic area for us  which could entail other factors that may lower their operating metrics 
if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines to meet our committed schedules and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines  our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained  our manufacturing costs per watt could increase  and this may impair our growth plans and or cause us to lose customers  resulting in lower net sales  higher liabilities and lower net income than we anticipate 
in addition  we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our long term supply contracts 
some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced 
if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts  we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 
some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer  which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment 
as a result  the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working 
if any piece of equipment fails  production along the entire production line could be interrupted and we could be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our long term supply contracts 
in addition  the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs  all of which would adversely impact our financial results 
if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt  we will be in default under certain of our long term supply contracts and our profitability could decline 
our long term supply contracts either require us to increase the minimum average number of watts per module over the term of the contract or have a price adjustment for increases or decreases in the number of watts per module relative to a base number of watts per module 
our failure to achieve these metrics could reduce our profitability or allow some of our customers to terminate their contracts 
in addition  all of our long term supply contracts in europe specify a sales price per watt that declines at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of each contract in our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate at which our contractual prices decrease 
furthermore  our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 
we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 
we expect to continue to expand our business in order to meet our contractual obligations  satisfy demand for our solar modules and maintain or increase market share 
however  depending on the amount of additional contractual obligations we enter into and our ability to expand our manufacturing capabilities in accordance with our expectations  we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our long term supply contracts and other commitments  in which case we could be in default under such agreements and our operating results may be adversely affected 
following the completion of our expansion of our ohio plant in  we will have grown from one production line in ohio in to production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately mw based on the fourth quarter of average per line run rate at our existing plants 
construction of our two line french manufacturing facility is expected to begin in the second half of and a full annual production capacity of more than mw is expected to be reached in early our eight line malaysian expansion is expected to start production in the first half of page to manage the continued rapid expansion of our operations  we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls and expand  train and manage our growing associate base 
our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers  suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers 
in addition  our current and planned operations  personnel  systems and internal procedures and controls might be inadequate to support our future growth 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities  execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 
implementing a new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business or operations and could adversely impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
we expect to complete phase of this implementation in the second half of this project requires significant investment of capital and human resources  the re engineering of many processes of our business  and the attention of many associates and managers who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business 
any disruptions  delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could result in potentially much higher costs than we had anticipated and could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations  file sec reports in a timely manner and or otherwise operate our business  or otherwise impact our controls environment  and any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks  including unfavorable political  regulatory  labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 
we have significant marketing  distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states 
in  of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in the european union 
in the future  we expect to expand our operations into china  india and other countries in europe  asia and the middle east and elsewhere  as a result  we will be subject to the legal  political  social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent to international operations  include  but are not limited to  the following difficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems  foreign countries may impose additional income and withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign operations  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade and investment  including currency exchange controls  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect our profitability in us dollars to the extent the price of our solar modules and cost of raw materials  labor and equipment is denominated in a foreign currency  inability to obtain  maintain or enforce intellectual property rights  risk of nationalization of private enterprises  changes in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate  including changes in the government incentives we are relying on  unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements  including those with respect to environmental protection  export duties and quotas  opaque approval processes in which the lack of transparency may cause delays and increase the uncertainty of project approvals  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  difficulty in repatriating earnings  page difficulty in negotiating a successful collective bargaining agreement in france or other jurisdictions  trade barriers such as export requirements  tariffs  taxes  local content requirements and other restrictions and expenses  which could increase the price of our solar modules and make us less competitive in some countries  and difficulty of and costs relating to compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas countries in which we offer and sell our solar modules 
our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries 
our overall success as a global business depends  in part  on our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social and political conditions 
we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 
risks related to our systems business project development or construction activities may not be successful and projects under development may not receive required permits or construction may not commence as scheduled  which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 
the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks 
we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering  permitting  legal  and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible  economically attractive or capable of being built 
success in developing a particular project is contingent upon  among other things negotiation of satisfactory engineering  procurement and construction agreements  receipt of required governmental permits and approvals  including the right to interconnect to the electric grid  payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are non refundable  obtaining construction financing  and timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction 
successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors  including delays in obtaining required governmental permits and approvals  uncertainties relating to land costs for projects on land subject to bureau of land management procedures  unforeseen engineering problems  construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls  page work stoppages  cost over runs equipment and materials supply  adverse weather conditions  and environmental and geological conditions 
if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power facility  or fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates  we may be subject to liquidated damages and or penalties under the epc agreement or other agreements relating to the project  and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project 
some of these investments are included as assets on our balance under the line item project assets 
if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project  we may write down or write off some or all of these capitalized investments  which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 
in  we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties 
we may enter into fixed price epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of our solar power systems 
all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project  and these are reflected in the overall price that we charge our customers for the project 
these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors  suppliers and other parties to the project 
in addition  we require qualified  licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems 
shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs 
should miscalculations in planning a project or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase commensurately the epc sales price  we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 
we may be unable to acquire or lease land and or obtain the approvals  licenses and permits necessary to build and operate pv power plants in a timely and cost effective manner  and regulatory agencies  local communities or labor unions may delay  prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the pv plants we intend to build 
in order to construct and operate our pv plants  we need to acquire or lease land and obtain all necessary local  county  state and federal approvals  licenses and permits 
we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed  may not receive or retain the requisite approvals  permits and licenses or may encounter other problems which could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants 
for instance  the california independent system operator has recently modified its transmission interconnection rules  phasing out a serial process in favor of a cluster process for new projects  and may further modify its rules in a manner that could negatively impact our favorable position in transmission queues 
certain of our california projects under development will remain subject to the serial process while other projects in earlier stages of development  as well as new projects on a going forward basis  will be subject to the cluster process 
although the transition to the cluster process is still evolving and its ultimate impact is not yet fully known  our project transmission cost could be materially higher than previously estimated under the serial process and our projects could be delayed or subject to transmission planning timing uncertainties 
we also may be required to post interconnection deposits which may not be refundable sooner than previously estimated under the serial process 
many of our proposed pv plants are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and right of way procedures and processes 
the authorization for the use  construction and operation of pv plants and associated transmission facilities on federal  state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights  private rights of way and other easements  environmental  agricultural  cultural  recreational and aesthetic impacts  and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses 
the inability to obtain the required permits and  potentially  excessive delay in obtaining such permits due  for example  to litigation  could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants and could result in a potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project 
moreover  project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions  including mitigation requirements and costs  could affect the financial success of a given project 
in addition  local labor unions may increase the cost of  and or lower the productivity of  project development in canada and california 
in china our projects are subject to a number of government approvals  including the approval of a pre feasibility and feasibility study 
individually  the pre feasibility and feasibility study require many different government approvals at the national  provincial and local levels  and the approval process is discretionary and not fully transparent 
page lack of transmission capacity availability  potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity power sales 
in order to deliver electricity from our pv plants to our customers  our projects need to connect to the transmission grid 
the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size  delays in project implementation  increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project 
these transmission issues  as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear  could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity sales 
our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 
the construction of our large utility scale solar power projects under development by us is expected in many cases to require project financing  including non recourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets 
uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a sufficient magnitude to finance their construction 
if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan 
in addition  we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax oriented  strategic industry and other equity investors 
such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts  in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  for projects in which we provide epc services but are not the project developer  our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to purchase our pv plant projects  which  in turn  is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases 
depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets and other factors  such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 
if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv power plant projects from us  we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales  and this could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business and or generate revenue 
see also the risk factor above entitled an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for end users to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules and or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for photovoltaic modules 
developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of a power purchase agreement or an epc contract  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our solar power project development cycles  which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv power plant project  vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature 
as a result of these long project cycles  we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including  for example  large transmission deposits or other payments  which may be non refundable in advance of the signing of ppas and epc contracts and the receipt of any revenue  much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing 
our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers after making such upfront investments could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing  terms and timing commercially acceptable to us 
other risks we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions  and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 
in april  we acquired the solar power project development business of optisolar inc and in the future  we may acquire additional companies  project pipelines  products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks 
these risks include the following difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  page difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and associates from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues  difficulty integrating the acquired company s accounting  management information and other administrative systems  inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business  inability to retain key customers  vendors and other business partners of the acquired business  inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  incurring acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results  potential impairment of our relationships with our associates  customers  partners  distributors or third party providers of technology or products  potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality  architecture and development or legal and financial liabilities  among other things  potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective  potential inability to obtain  or obtain in a timely manner  approvals from governmental authorities  which could delay or prevent such acquisitions  and potential delay in customer purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings 
mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky  and ultimately  if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 
we are dependent on the services of michael j 
ahearn  our executive chairman  robert j 
gillette  our chief executive officer  bruce sohn  our president  jens meyerhoff  our chief financial officer  mary beth gustafsson  our executive vice president  general counsel and corporate secretary  carol campbell  our executive vice president  human resources  tk kallenbach  our executive vice president  marketing and product management  david eaglesham  our chief technology officer  and james zhu  our chief accounting officer and other members of our senior management team 
the loss of ahearn  gillette  sohn  meyerhoff  gustafsson  campbell  kallenbach  eaglesham  zhu or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us 
there is a risk that we will not be able to retain or replace these key associates 
several of our current key associates  including ahearn  gillette  sohn  meyerhoff  gustafsson  campbell  kallenbach  eaglesham and zhu are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain post employment non competition provisions 
however  these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the non competition provisions is uncertain 
page if we are unable to attract  train and retain key personnel  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  on our ability to attract  train and retain management  operations and technical personnel 
recruiting and retaining capable personnel  particularly those with expertise in the photovoltaic industry and thin film technology  are vital to our success 
there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties  which  if determined adversely to us  could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 
our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and know how without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the validity and scope of claims relating to photovoltaic technology patents involve complex scientific  legal and factual considerations and analysis and  therefore  may be highly uncertain 
we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or pay ongoing royalties  require us to redesign our solar module  or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies 
protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 
currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales  cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 
although our reporting currency is the us dollar  we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate 
as a result  we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk 
for example  and of our net sales were denominated in euro for the years ended december  and december   respectively  and we expect a large percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future 
in addition  our operating expenses for our plants located outside the us currently germany and malaysia and our operations for our systems business in canada and other european countries will be denominated in the local currency 
changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses 
for example  the weakening of the euro reduced our net sales by million during fiscal compared with fiscal in addition  we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from our reporting currency 
for example  our european long term supply contracts specify fixed pricing in euros through and do not adjust for changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rate 
we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 
we could also expand our business into emerging markets  many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy 
conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 
our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us 
deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure  and therefore  result in exchange losses 
the estate of john t 
walton and its affiliates have significant control over us and their interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 
our largest stockholder  the estate of john t 
walton and its affiliates  including jcl holdings  llc and jtw trust no 
uad collectively  the estate  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock at december  as a result  the estate has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers  tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
the interests of the estate could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 
for example  the concentration of ownership held by the estate could delay  defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger  takeover or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 
if our goodwill  investment in a related party or project assets become impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill  investment in a related party or project assets are impaired 
such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
page as required by accounting rules  we review our goodwill  investment in a related party and project assets for impairment when events or changes in our business or circumstances indicate that their fair value might be less than their carrying value 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and significantly slower growth rates in our industry 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we would write down project assets  which are capitalized on the balance sheet for certain solar power projects  should we determine that the project is not commercially viable 
unanticipated changes in our tax provisions  the adoption of a new us tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory  services  licenses  funding and other items in intercompany transactions 
we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions 
tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges  cross jurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes 
we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision 
however  there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations  and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
in addition  our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure  loss of our malaysian tax holiday  changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process 
in addition  president obama s administration has recently announced proposals for new us tax legislation that  if adopted  could adversely affect our tax rate

overview we manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology  and we design  construct and sell photovoltaic pv solar power systems 
in furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar energy and achieving price parity with conventional fossil fuel based peak electricity generation  we are continually focused on reducing pv system costs in three primary areas module manufacturing  balance of system bos costs consisting of costs of components of a solar power system other than the solar modules  including inverters  mounting hardware  grid interconnection equipment  wiring and other devices  and installation labor costs  and cost of capital 
first  with respect to our module manufacturing costs  our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world  based on publicly available information 
in  our total average manufacturing costs were per watt  which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers 
by continuing to improve conversion efficiency and line throughput  lower material cost and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs  we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers 
second  by continuing to improve conversion efficiency  leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms  and accelerate installation time  we believe we can continue to make substantial reductions in bos costs  which represent over half of all costs associated with a typical utility scale pv solar power system 
finally  we believe that continuing to strengthen our financial position  including our balance sheet and credit profile  will enable us to continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our solar power systems  thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by solar power systems  which incorporate our modules and technology 
page we believe that combining our reliable  low cost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity  to accelerate the adoption of our technology in large scale systems and to further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean  affordable solar electricity 
on february   we were incorporated as a delaware corporation 
prior to that date  we operated as a delaware limited liability company 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday on or before december all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december   all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december   and all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december  we use a week fiscal quarter 
manufacturing capacity as of december   we operated production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately mw based on the fourth quarter of average per line run rate at our existing plants at our manufacturing plants in perrysburg  ohio  frankfurt oder  germany and kulim  malaysia 
we expect to add an additional production line to our perrysburg  ohio manufacturing facility in  resulting in a mw increase in manufacturing capacity based on the fourth quarter of average per line run rate at our existing plants 
we expect to increase our manufacturing capacity to production lines by  with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately gw based on the fourth quarter of average per line run rate at our existing plants 
market overview we project the global market for pv solar modules to have a compound annual growth rate through  increasing demand to approximately gw worldwide 
we expect approximately gw of global demand in in addressing a growing global need for pv solar electricity  we target markets with varying approaches depending on the underlying economics  market requirements and distribution channels 
in subsidized feed in tariff markets  such as germany  we have historically sold most of solar modules to solar project developers  system integrators and independent power producers 
in other markets  such as the united states  the demand for solar has been primarily driven by renewable portfolio standards requiring regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar power 
to meet the needs of these markets and enable balance of system cost reductions  we have developed a fully integrated systems business that can provide a low cost turn key utility scale pv system solution for system owners and low cost electricity to utility end users 
by building a fully integrated systems business  we believe we are in position to expand our business in transitional  and eventually economically sustainable markets in which subsidies or incentives are minimal  that are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand  such as the united states  china  india and parts of europe 
in the long term  we plan on competing on an economic basis with conventional fossil fuel based peaking power generation 
in  the solar industry moved from a supply driven to a demand driven environment  with increasing competitive pressure as the photovoltaic industry s total manufacturing capacity to produce solar modules exceeded demand for those products 
we expect that the photovoltaic industry s total manufacturing capacity to produce solar modules will continue to exceed demand in our customers faced significant challenges under the prevailing economic conditions  including tight liquidity and extended cash realization cycles  weakened balance sheets  constrained working capital  a volatile pricing environment leading to deferred project equity investments  constrained project finance outside of germany and capital preservation within us utilities during the year 
we extended our payment terms with certain customers from days to days from the date of invoice and reduced prices under our long term contracts in response to the economic conditions 
during the second half of  german installation activity was stronger than in the first half of  driven by a combination of anticipation of reduced german feed in tariffs  seasonal demand  customer participation in our rebate program and improving project finance  tax equity and corporate finance conditions 
the first half of in comparison had been characterized by project and channel competition with aggressive crystalline silicon module pricing  deferred project equity investment based on anticipation of further reductions  project debt constraints and delays and construction financing delays 
to the extent the challenging conditions mentioned above return as seasonal strength subsides  our results of operations could be adversely affected by declines in the selling prices of our modules  decreases in sales volumes of our modules and or increases in our solar module inventories 
we expect that demand for our solar modules in germany in the first half of will increase due to the uncertainty around the german subsidies 
the german feed in tariffs are currently under review by the government and certain proposals under discussion would further reduce these tariffs in the second quarter and later dates in page in  we continued to expand into certain key transition markets  such as the united states  within which affordable solar electricity solutions could be developed and ultimately evolve into economically sustainable markets 
our acquisition of the project development business of optisolar inc in april furthered our development of solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the united states that are seeking cost effective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements 
in january  we completed the acquisition of certain assets from edison mission group s solar project development pipeline consisting of utility scale solar projects located primarily on private land in california and the southwestern united states 
in the pv module segment  we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and photovoltaic systems 
solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes  including reliability  module cost per watt and levelized cost of electricity lcoe  meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system s life 
we are the lowest cost pv module manufacturer in the solar industry  based on publicly available information  as evidenced by the further reduction in our average manufacturing cost per watt from during to during this cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their lcoe 
our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and permits a continuous highly automated industrial manufacturing process  our scale and our operational excellence 
in addition  our modules use approximately of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 
the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules 
the current spot market price of polysilicon of approximately between and per kilogram kg enables us to remain one of the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry 
however  the timing and rate of decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock could lead to pricing pressure for solar modules 
although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer  we estimate based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors  that a per kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease  respectively  our competitors manufacturing cost per watt by approximately 
given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules  there are higher balance of system costs associated with systems using our modules 
thus  to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon based modules 
our cost reduction roadmap anticipates manufacturing cost per watt reductions for our modules of per year 
during the twelve months ended december   we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by from our cost per watt in the fourth quarter of fiscal while our modules currently enjoy competitive advantages in these product performance attributes  there can be no guarantee that these advantages will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all 
any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in margin compression  a decline in average selling prices of our solar modules  erosion in our market share for modules  a decrease in the rate of revenue growth and or a decline in overall revenues 
we have taken  and continue to take  several actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures  including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary in core markets to drive module volumes  continuously making progress along our cost reduction roadmap and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 
as we expand our systems business into transition and sustainable markets  we can offer value beyond the pv module  reduce our exposure to module only competition and provide comprehensive utility scale photovoltaic systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs 
thus  our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for  and manufacturing throughput of our solar modules 
finally  we seek to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers and continue to develop our range of offerings  including epc capabilities and operating and maintenance services  in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules 
financial operations overview the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 
net sales components business currently  the majority of our net sales is generated from the sale of solar modules 
we currently price and sell our solar modules per watt of power 
as a result  our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts or price 
during  we sold almost all of our solar modules to solar power system project developers  system integrators and operators headquartered in germany  france  spain and italy  which either resell our solar modules to end users or integrate them into power plants that they own or operate or sell 
page as of december   we had long term supply contracts for the sale of solar modules expiring at the end of with fourteen european solar power system project developers and system integrators 
we also have an agreement expiring in with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the united states  which is a related party 
these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from through  and therefore  will significantly affect our overall financial performance 
we have the right to terminate certain long term supply contracts upon months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred 
in addition  our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume 
these delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the long term supply contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers 
in the case of a late delivery  certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue 
if we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments  our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis 
certain of our long term supply contracts require us to deliver solar modules that  in total  meet or exceed specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year or specify an annual decline in the sales price per watt under these contracts 
as a result  our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease 
because the sales prices under our long term supply contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year  we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers 
although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the long term supply contracts  our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross profit 
our sales prices under the long term supply contracts are denominated in euro  exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
during the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in euro and subject to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 
we have in the past amended pricing and other terms in our long term supply contracts in order to remain competitive  as described below  and we may decide in the future to further amend these contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment 
for example  during the three months ended march   we amended our long term supply contracts with certain customers to further reduce the sales price per watt under these contracts in and in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under the contracts 
we also extended the payment terms for certain customers under these contracts from net days to net days to increase liquidity in our sales channel and to reflect longer module shipment times from our manufacturing plants in malaysia 
during the third quarter of  we amended our long term supply contracts with certain of our customers to implement a program which provides a price rebate to certain of these customers for solar modules purchased from us 
the intent of this program is to enable our customers to successfully compete in our core segments in germany 
the rebate program applies a specified rebate rate to solar modules sold for solar power projects in germany at the beginning of each quarter for the upcoming quarter 
the rebate program is subject to periodic review  and we will adjust the rebate rate quarterly upward or downward as appropriate 
the rebate period commenced during the third quarter of and terminates at the end of the fourth quarter of customers need to meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for and benefit from this program 
we account for rebates as a reduction to the selling price of our solar modules and therefore as a reduction in revenue 
no rebates granted under this program can be claimed in cash  and all rebates will be applied to reduce outstanding accounts receivable balances 
during the year ended december   we extended rebates to customers in the amount of million million at an average exchange rate of we also enter into one time module sale agreements with customers for specific projects 
under our customer contracts we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment 
our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 
during  principal customers of our components business were blitzstrom gmbh  edf en development  gehrlicher solar ag  juwi solar gmbh  and phoenix solar ag 
during  each of these five customers individually accounted for between and of our component segment s net sales 
all of our other customers individually accounted for less than of our component business net sales during the year ended december  page systems business through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete solar power system solution  which includes project development  epc services  o m services and  when required  project finance 
net sales from our systems segment are comprised of the following types of transactions transaction description engineer and procure ep contract design of a solar electricity generation system for a customer that uses our solar modules  includes the procurement of all other required balance of system bos components from third party suppliers 
engineer  procure and construct epc contract design and construction for a customer of a turnkey solar electricity generation system that uses our solar modules  includes the procurement of all other bos components from third party suppliers 
sale of project assets sale of project assets to a customer at various stages of development 
this generally includes a single project consisting of costs incurred for permits  land or land rights or power off take agreements 
operating and maintenance o m agreement typically a fixed priced long term services agreement 
during the year ended december   net sales from our systems business resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems in the fourth fiscal quarter to utilities in the united states and canada 
our systems business does not currently meet the quantitative criteria for disclosures as a separate reporting segment 
on april   we completed the acquisition of the solar power project development business of optisolar inc and we have integrated this business into our systems business 
net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors  including the magnitude and effectiveness of renewable portfolio standards  economic incentives such as european feed in tariffs or the federal investment tax credit in the united states and other pv system demand drivers 
for a given solar power project  we recognize revenue for our systems business either after execution of an epc agreement with a third party  specifying the terms and conditions of the construction of the solar power plant  by applying the provisions for real estate accounting  by applying the percentage of completion method of accounting  or upon the sale of the complete system solution  as appropriate for the particular facts and circumstances related to the project and its sale 
at any given point in time  aggregate contracted sales amounts with respect to the systems segment generally consist of the uncompleted portion of contracted projects where we have entered into a definitive epc agreement with the customer 
cost of sales components business our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules  such as tempered back glass  transparent conductive oxide coated front glass  cadmium telluride  laminate  connector assemblies  laminate edge seal  and other items 
our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense  equipment maintenance  environmental health and safety expenses  quality and production control and procurement 
cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plants and equipment and facility related expenses 
in addition  we accrue warranty and solar module collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales 
page we implemented a program in to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use 
under our solar module collection and recycling program  we enter into an agreement with the end users of the solar power systems that use our solar modules 
in the agreement  we commit  at our expense  to collect the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their useful life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used solar modules or recycled to recover some of the raw materials 
in return  the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our module collection and recycling program or any other program that we might approve of 
the owner is also responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide 
at the time we sell a solar module  we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future module collection and recycling obligation 
we subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation  which we classify within selling  general and administrative expense 
overall  we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module  an increase in unit output per production line  continued geographic expansion into lower cost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 
systems business within our systems business  project related costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of balance of system costs for inverters  electrical and mounting hardware  project management and engineering costs  and installation labor costs  site specific costs  and development costs including transmission upgrade costs  interconnection fees and permitting costs 
as further described in note segment reporting  at the time when the revenue recognition criteria are met  we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business as net sales of our components business 
therefore  the related cost of sales will also be included within our components business 
deferred project costs represent capitalized costs related to the deferred revenue for project development or project construction activities sold to a third party typically under an epc agreement  for which the revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
we recognize these costs as we recognize the revenue for these projects 
deferred project costs at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
gross profit gross profit is affected by numerous factors  including our average selling prices  foreign exchange rates  our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities 
gross profit is also subject to competitive pressures  and we have in the past and may in the future decide to amend our long term supply contracts  which specify our sales price per watt 
other factors impacting gross profits are the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached  the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses coupled with a geographic factor 
gross profit margin is affected by our systems business  which generally operates at a lower gross profit margin due to the pass through nature of certain balance of system components procured from third parties 
gross profit for our systems business excludes cost of sales for solar modules  that are included in the gross profit of our components business 
research and development research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products  materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities 
we acquire equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense 
we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv systems using our modules 
we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the united states department of energy  brookhaven national laboratory and several universities 
we report our research and development expense net of grant funding 
we received million and million of grant funding during the years ended december  and december   respectively  that we applied towards our research and development programs 
we did not receive any grant funding during the year ended december  we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity 
over time  we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 
page selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  travel expense and other selling expenses 
we expect these expenses to increase in the near term  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts  improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting  compliance and other infrastructure required for an expanding public company 
over time  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase 
production start up production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production  including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase 
it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program  to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 
we incurred production start up expense of million during the year ended december  in connection with the qualification of our german plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our malaysian manufacturing center 
we incurred production start up expense of million during the year ended december  in connection with the planning and preparation of our plants at the malaysian manufacturing center 
production start up expense for the year ended december  was million and related to plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center and our ohio plant expansion 
in general  we expect production start up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility  primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 
over time  we expect production start up expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 
foreign currency gain loss foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 
interest income interest income is earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash and investments 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  is incurred on various debt financings 
income tax expense income taxes are imposed on our income by the taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate  principally the united states  germany and malaysia 
the statutory federal tax rate in the united states is while the tax rate in germany and malaysia is approximately and  respectively 
in malaysia we have been granted a long term tax holiday  pursuant to which substantially all our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 
page critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto 
some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for making these estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty

our critical accounting estimates  which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  are as follows solar module collection and recycling 
at the time of sale  we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold when they have reached the end of their useful lives 
we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules  which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport  the cost of freight from the solar modules installation sites to a recycling center  the material  labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services 
we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes  about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled and about the timing of solar modules returns for recycling 
in the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations  we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement 
at december   our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was million 
a decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by million  to million  a increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by million  to million 
product warranties 
we provide a limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owner of our solar modules 
we also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least of their initial power output rating during the first years following their installation and at least of their initial power output rating during the following years 
our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser 
we accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales  using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims  our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing 
accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states  its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 
we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with asc  income taxes 
once established  we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates  and the actual cost of a legal claim  tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities  if any 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period  we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
conversely  to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary  that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed  which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 
page we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
we have concluded that all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states 
if our intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes  additional taxes may be required to be accrued 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we do not amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and  if necessary  we would record any impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
we will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach of valuation  which includes the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach of valuation  which considers values of comparable businesses  to determine the fair value of our goodwill 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach 
we reported million of goodwill at december   which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from turner renewable energy  llc and optisolar inc in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we performed our annual test of our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  and concluded that it was not impaired 
testing goodwill for impairment involves two steps 
the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  impairment is indicated and step two of the test must be performed 
that step involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the net fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities is attributed to goodwill  and any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value is written off as an impairment loss 
the fair value of our goodwill substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore we concluded that there was no indication that our goodwill was impaired and that performing step two of the goodwill impairment test was not applicable

revenue recognized for our systems business during was million and resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems to utilities in the united states and canada 
the increase in mw volume of solar modules sold is attributable to the full production ramp of all four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center  continued improvements to our manufacturing process and the growth in our systems business 
in addition  we increased the average conversion efficiency by approximately during compared with our average selling price decreased by approximately during compared with approximately of the decline in our average selling price was primarily due to competitive pressure  including the commencement of a customer rebate program in the third quarter of additionally  our average selling price was adversely impacted by approximately due to a decrease in the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and by approximately due to a shift in customer mix

cost of sales years ended year over dollars in thousands year change cost of sales of net sales the increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes  which resulted from the commencement of production at all of our four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center  production ramp of our perrysburg  ohio expansion  and an increase in business activity associated with our systems segment business 
the increased production and sales volumes in our components business and increased volume sold through our systems business had the following effects a million increase in direct material expense including an million amortization of project assets acquired through our optisolar acquisition  a million increase in warranty expense and accruals for the estimated future costs associated with the collection and recycling of our solar modules due to increased sales  a million increase in sales freight and other costs  and a million increase in manufacturing overhead costs 
the increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses including a million increase in share based compensation expense  a million increase in facility and related expenses and a million increase in depreciation expense 
each of these manufacturing overhead cost increases primarily resulted from increased infrastructure associated with the build out of our malaysian manufacturing center and start up of our systems business

fiscal years ended december  and december  net sales years ended year over dollars in thousands year change net sales the increase in our net sales was due primarily to a increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold during compared with due to strong demand for our solar modules in europe 
the increase in mw volume of solar modules sold was attributable to the full production ramp of our german plant  commencement of product shipments at the first two plants at our malaysian manufacturing center and continued improvements to our manufacturing process 
in addition  we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately during compared with our average selling price decreased by approximately during compared with  mainly due to a contractual price decline  partially offset by a increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro 
approximately of our net sales during resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in germany 
cost of sales years ended year over dollars in thousands year change cost of sales of net sales the increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes  which resulted from the full production ramp of our german facility and commencement of production at our first three plants at our malaysian manufacturing center 
these factors caused a million increase in direct material expense  a million increase in warranty and accruals for the estimated future costs associated with the collection and recycling of our solar modules  a million increase in sales freight and other costs and a million increase in manufacturing overhead costs 
the increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses  including a million increase in share based compensation expense  a million increase in facility and related expenses and a million increase in depreciation expense  in each case primarily resulting from increased infrastructure associated with our german and malaysian expansions 
gross profit years ended year over dollars in thousands year change gross profit of net sales as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased percentage points from to  representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our german and malaysian expansions  which drove a increase in the number of megawatts sold

our malaysian subsidiary has been granted a tax holiday for a period of years  which was originally scheduled to commence on january   which generally provides for a exemption from malaysian income tax 
subsequent to year end  we received formal approval granting our request to pull forward this previously approved tax holiday by one year 
due to the fact that this approval was granted subsequent to the end of  we concluded that the financial impact should be reflected in our financial results 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared with million as of december  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flows from operating activities and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
however  if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions  we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan 
our expanding systems business is expected to have increasing liquidity requirements in the future 
solar power project development cycles  which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a photovoltaic power plant project  vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature 
as a result of these long project cycles  we may need to make significant up front investments of resources in advance of the signing of power purchase agreements and epc contracts and the receipt of any revenue 
we have historically financed these up front investments primarily using working capital and cash on hand 
in the future  we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings 
such financings could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms  we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy 
the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets over the past two years has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions 
as of december   our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our international operations accounted for of our net sales during and of our net sales during  of which  and of these international sales  respectively  were denominated in euros 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales 
fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate  affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses 
in the past  most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts 
for example  our long term supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate 
for the year ended december   a change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by million 
for our manufacturing operations in germany and malaysia  many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries are denominated in the local currency 
our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction exposure  cash flow exposure and earnings translation exposure 
transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables  investments  accounts payable  debt  solar module collection and recycling liabilities and inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge assets and liabilities against the short term effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities 
as of december   the total unrealized loss on our foreign exchange forward contracts was million 
these contracts have maturities of less than two months 
since our acquisition of the solar power project development business of optisolar on april   we have also become exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and canadian dollar 
page as of december   the total notional value of our foreign exchange forward contracts was as follows notional amounts and us dollar equivalents in millions transaction currency notional amount us equivalent balance sheet close rate on december  purchase euro sell euro sell us dollar for euro n a purchase malaysian ringgits myr myr sell malaysian ringgits myr myr purchase japanese yen jpy jpy sell japanese yen jpy jpy purchase canadian dollar cad cad sell canadian dollar cad cad if the us dollar would have weakened by against the euro  malaysian ringgit  canadian dollar and japanese yen  the favorable impact on our income before income taxes related to our foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell euro  malaysian ringgit  canadian dollars and japanese yen would have been million 
cash flow exposure we expect many of the components of our business to have material future cash flows  including revenues and expenses  which will be denominated in currencies other than the components functional currency 
our primary cash flow exposures are future customer collections and vendor payments 
changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currency and the other currencies in which they transact business will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled 
accordingly  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows 
we account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 
we initially report the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction is realized 
most of our german plant s operating expenses are denominated in euros  creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales 
in addition  we purchased foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro 
as of december   the unrealized loss on these contracts was million and the total notional value of the contracts was million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of 
the weighted average forward exchange rate for these contracts was at december  earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations 
these contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income  net 
we do not hedge translation exposure at this time  but may do so in the future 
in the past  currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations 
for example  currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by million and million in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations  we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
page interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system 
although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is considered to be approximately years  end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation 
as a result  many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditures 
an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system 
this could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales 
in addition  we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar power systems as an investment  funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt 
an increase in interest rates could lower an investor s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems  which  in each case  could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 
during  we entered into a credit facility with a consortium of banks for the financing of our german plant  which bore interest at the euro interbank offered rate euribor plus 
we had interest rate swap contracts with a financial institution that effectively converted to fixed rates the variable rate of euribor on the term loan portion of this credit facility 
these swap contracts were required under the credit facility agreement which we repaid and terminated on june  therefore  we terminated these interest rate swap contracts on june  and consequently recognized interest expense of million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of 
the termination of the interest rate swap contracts settled on june  during may  we entered into a euro denominated credit facility to finance some of the equipment cost for our malaysian manufacturing center 
the loans under the fixed rate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 
the loans under the floating rate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at euribor plus a margin of 
on may   we entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional value of million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of to receive a six month floating interest rate  equal to euribor  and pay a fixed rate of 
this contract became effective on september  the notional amount of the interest rate swap contract is scheduled to decline in correspondence to our scheduled principal payments on the underlying hedged debt 
in addition  we invest in debt securities  which exposes us to interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including money market mutual funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pre tax yield of  with a weighted average maturity of months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by million 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market mutual funds  federal and foreign agency debt  supranational debt  corporate debt securities  foreign government obligations and asset backed securities 
commodity and component risk we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials  components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules 
also  some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier 
we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers  a process which could take up to months if successful  but some suppliers are unique and it may not be feasible to qualify second source suppliers 
in some cases  we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components  but these arrangements are normally of shorter duration than the term of our long term supply contracts with our customers 
as a result  we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules 
in addition  a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices for our raw materials and components and even a disruption in our manufacturing process 
since our selling price under our long term supply contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our long term supply contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their terms  we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 
page credit risk we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk 
these consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  investments  trade accounts receivable  interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments 
we place cash  cash equivalents  investments  interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty 
we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions
