payless over  retail stores in countries and territories in north america  the caribbean  central america  south america and the middle east operate under the payless name 
our mission is to democratize fashion and design in footwear and accessories 
payless seeks to compete effectively by bringing to market differentiated  trend right merchandise before mass market discounters and at the same time as department and specialty retailers but at a more compelling value

the payless strategy focuses on four key elements on trend  targeted product  effective brand marketing  a great shopping experience  and efficient operations 
by offering on trend targeted product  we successfully build a connection with our customers 
we interpret fashion trends timely and translate this into on trend product in our stores through an extensive due diligence process 
beginning about a year in advance  we review key fashion markets worldwide 
we employ trend services and examine the industry s ready to wear forecasts  then  we test product 
by doing so  we gain valuable intelligence well in advance of the seasons arrival 
we refine our ideas  commit to a product assortment  and display that assortment in our stores at about the same time as other fashion oriented higher priced competitors 
customers demand on trend products  but have different definitions of what that means 
importantly  we believe merchandise can be on trend at a great value 
customers will always find tiered pricing at payless with good better best price points 
through elements of promotion and pricing tiers  we strive to maintain market share with budget oriented shoppers while driving the opportunity to increase market share with expressive customers 
the next component of the payless strategy is brand marketing effectiveness  and the development of a house of brands architecture 
we are building  licensing and buying appropriate authentic and aspirational brands to appeal to our major customer segments 
brands help us validate our on trend positioning  add an element of exclusivity  and build an emotional connection with customers

our hot zone design features attractive gondolas and tables with product featured by style in the front of the store  while maintaining the traditional shopping experience by size in the back of the store 
hot zone will continue to be the design for our remodels  new stores  and relocations as we move forward 
the last major component of our payless strategy is improving the efficiency of our operations

the distribution centers  located in california and ohio  have also 
table of contents reduced our disaster recovery and business interruption risk

key events the significant challenges that have faced the global economy in and the highly uncertain global economic outlook have adversely affected consumer confidence and spending levels 
these conditions  along with severe credit market disruptions  among other factors  have adversely affected the global footwear retailing industry 
to mitigate this impact  we have managed inventory very closely  flowing seasonal product closer to the time it is worn  and executed a number of gross margin improvement initiatives 
we have also reduced our operating cost structure through a series of continuous improvement initiatives that focus on reducing costs and increasing cash flow 
these initiatives include occupancy cost rationalization  renegotiating procurement contracts and re 
table of contents examining existing contracts for cost reduction opportunities  and establishing new processes in merchandise sourcing that more effectively utilize factory capacity and ensure the best pricing

impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit using both a market approach and an income approach 
if potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  due to weakening economic conditions combined with weaker 
table of contents than expected holiday sales  we revised our financial projections 
these circumstances indicated a potential impairment of our goodwill and  as such  we assessed the fair value of our goodwill to determine if its book value exceeded its fair value 
as a result of this update we determined that the book value of our goodwill did exceed its fair value and we recorded an impairment charge of million within the plg retail reporting segment in we recorded no such goodwill impairment charge in interest expense  net interest income and expense components were dollars in millions interest expense interest income interest expense  net the decline in interest expense in compared to is primarily a result of a lower interest rate on the unhedged portion of our term loan facility as well as a decreased borrowings on our revolving loan facility  term loan facility and senior subordinated notes 
the decline in interest income in compared to is primarily a result of lower interest rates on our invested cash balance 
the increase in interest expense for compared to is primarily due to borrowings on our term loan facility used to fund the plg acquisition as well as borrowings on the revolving loan facility  offset by lower rates on the unhedged portion of the term loan facility 
the decline in interest income for is primarily a result of lower interest rates on our invested cash balance 
loss on early extinguishment of debt the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the premium  in excess of par  paid to redeem a portion of our senior subordinated notes  the acceleration of the discount on the senior subordinated notes and the acceleration of deferred debt costs on both our senior subordinated notes and our term loan facility in proportion to the amounts extinguished in the fourth quarter of income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations was in versus in our effective tax rates have differed from the us statutory rate principally due to the impact of our operations conducted in jurisdictions with rates lower than the us statutory rate  the benefit of jurisdictional and employment tax credits  favorable adjustments to our income tax reserves due primarily to favorable settlements of examinations by taxing authorities and the on going implementation of tax efficient business initiatives 
our effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted in due to the impairment of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for more information detailing the relative impact of these items on our tax rate on a comparative basis 
during fiscal year  we recorded net favorable discrete events of million relating primarily to the resolution of outstanding tax audits 
our estimate of uncertainty in income taxes is based on the framework established in income taxes accounting guidance 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits is often highly judgmental 
determinations regarding the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit can change as additional developments occur relative to the issue 
accordingly  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits 
we anticipate that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at january  will decrease by up to million within the next months due to potential settlements of on going examinations with tax authorities and the potential lapse of the statutes of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent that these tax benefits are recognized  the effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by up to million 

table of contents at january   deferred tax assets for federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards are million  less a valuation allowance of million 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire as follows expiration dates are denoted in parentheses dollars in millions amount federal net operating losses in state operating losses expiring by state operating losses between and state operating losses between and state operating losses between and state operating losses by foreign net operating losses related to recorded assets between and foreign net operating losses related to recorded assets between and total federal foreign tax credit carryforwards are million  million of this credit will expire if not utilized by  and the remaining million of this credit will expire if not utilized by federal general business credit carryforwards are million of which million will expire if not utilized by and the remaining million will expire if not utilized by state income tax credit carryforwards are million  less a valuation allowance of million 
the tax credit carryforwards related to the recorded assets expire as follows million by  million by  million by and million may be carried forward indefinitely 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for more information detailing the major components of our net deferred tax liability 
we recorded a valuation allowance against million of deferred tax assets arising in the majority of this valuation allowance relates to net operating losses generated by our colombian joint venture  which commenced operations in  and has not yet established a pattern of profitability 
our consolidated balance sheet as of january  includes deferred tax assets  net of related valuation allowances  of million 
in assessing the future realization of these assets  we concluded it is more likely than not the assets will be realized 
this conclusion was based in large part upon management s belief that we will generate sufficient quantities of taxable income from operations in future years in the appropriate tax jurisdictions 
if our near term forecasts are not achieved  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
this could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in a particular period 
as of january   we have not provided tax on our cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million  because it is our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely 
the calculation of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is complex and is not practicable 
if earnings were distributed  we would be subject to us taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign governments 
based on the facts and circumstances at that time  we would determine whether a credit for foreign taxes already paid would be available to reduce or offset the us tax liability 
we currently anticipate that earnings would not be repatriated unless it was tax efficient to do so 
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests represent our joint venture partners share of net earnings or losses on applicable international operations 
the decrease in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from to is due to decreased earnings from our joint ventures and the increase in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from to is due to increased earnings from our joint ventures

any materially adverse change in customer demand  fashion trends  competitive market forces or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix and retail locations  uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing  risks associated with foreign global sourcing or economic conditions worldwide could affect our ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations 
internally generated cash flow from operations has been our primary source of cash and we believe projected operating cash flows and current credit facilities will be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  scheduled debt repayments  and to support the development of our short term and long term operating strategies 
we usually finance our real estate through operating leases 
we ended with a cash and cash equivalents balance of million  an increase of million from our increase in cash and cash equivalents from is primarily driven by cash flow provided by operating activities  offset by cash flow used in investing activities and cash flow used in financing activities

table of contents cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow from operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the change in cash flow from operations from compared with is due to increases in net earnings and a decrease in working capital driven by reductions in inventory and increases in accounts payable  offset by a net reduction of accrued expenses as a result of the settlement of the adidas litigation 
the reduction in inventory was due primarily to our initiatives to reduce inventory levels  which was assisted by increased promotional activities  and the increase in accounts payable was due to the extension of payment terms with our vendors 
these initiatives caused timing differences which favorably impacted our cash flow from operations in we do not expect to see such timing differences in the change in cash flow from operations from compared with are due to decreases in net earnings and increases in our inventory balances due to increased first costs offset by increases in depreciation and amortization 
we contributed million to the plg pension plan in we do not plan to contribute to the plg pension plan during the fiscal year

as of january   we had merchandise purchase obligations in the amount of approximately million for which we will likely take delivery 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  excluding interest and penalties  is million as of january  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments on this balance 
financial condition ratios a summary of key financial information for the periods indicated is as follows debt capitalization ratio debt to capitalization has been computed by dividing total debt by capitalization 
total debt is defined as long term debt including current maturities  notes payable and borrowings under the revolving line of credit  if applicable 
capitalization is defined as total debt and shareowners equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio  including the present value of future minimum rental payments under operating leases as debt and as capitalization  was   and  respectively  for the periods referred to above 
the decrease in the debt capitalization ratio from to is primarily due to a lower debt balance in as a result of the early extinguishment of debt 
the increase of the debt capitalization ratio from to is primarily due to lower capitalization due to lower shareowners equity as a result of net losses in critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
inventories merchandise inventories in our stores are valued by the retail method and are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
prior to shipment to a specific store  inventories are valued at the lower of cost using the fifo basis  or market 
the retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail method  cost is determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio across groupings of similar items  known as departments 
as a result  the retail method results in an averaging of inventory costs across similar items within a department 
the cost to retail ratio is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis 
current owned retail represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a regular basis reduced for any permanent or clearance markdowns 
as a result  the retail method normally results in an inventory valuation that is lower than a traditional fifo cost basis 
inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including markdowns and shrinkage  which can significantly impact the owned retail and  therefore  the ending inventory valuation at cost 
specifically  the failure to take permanent or clearance markdowns on a timely basis can result in an overstatement of cost under the retail method 
we believe that our application of the retail method reasonably states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
wholesale inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the fifo method 

table of contents we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 
if changes in market conditions result in an increase in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory above our previous estimate  such recoveries would be recognized as the related goods are sold 
we have continually managed these risks in the past and believe we can successfully manage them in the future 
however  our revenues and operating margins may suffer if we are unable to effectively manage these risks 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable  which primarily relate to receivables from our wholesale customers  and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we also consider a review of accounts receivable aging  industry trends  customer financial strength  credit standing  and payment history to assess the probability of collection 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance might be required which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred  while expenditures for store remodels  refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the product capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized 
projects in progress are stated at cost  which includes the cost of construction and other direct costs attributable to the project 
no provision for depreciation is made on projects in progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and put into service 
property and equipment are reviewed on a store by store basis if an indicator of impairment exists to determine whether the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable 
estimated future cash flows on a store by store basis are used to determine if impairment exists 
the underlying estimates of cash flows include estimates of future revenues  gross margin rates and store expenses and are based upon the stores past and expected future performance 
to the extent our estimates for revenue growth and gross margin rates are not realized  we could record an impairment charge 
defined benefit plans the company has defined benefit pension plans 
one of the plans is frozen and no longer accrues future retirement benefits 
major assumptions used in the accounting for this employee benefit plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we use a cash flow matching approach for determining the appropriate discount rate for the defined benefit pension plan 
the approach is derived from us treasury rates  plus an option adjusted spread varying by maturity  to derive hypothetical aa corporate bond rates 
the calculation of pension expense is dependent on the determination of the assumptions used 
a basis point change in the discount rate will change annual expense by approximately million 
a basis point change in the expected long term return on assets will result in an approximate change of million in the annual expense 

table of contents insurance programs we retain our normal expected losses related primarily to workers compensation  physical loss to property and business interruption resulting from such loss and comprehensive general  product  and vehicle liability 
we purchase third party coverage for losses in excess of significant levels 
provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon estimates of aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing independent actuarial calculations 
these actuarial calculations utilize assumptions including historical claims experience  demographic factors and severity factors to estimate the frequency and severity of losses as well as the patterns surrounding the emergence  development and settlement of claims 
accounting for taxes our estimate of uncertainty in income taxes is based on the framework established in income taxes accounting guidance 
this guidance  which was adopted on february   prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits is often highly judgmental 
determinations regarding the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit can change as additional developments occur relative to the issue 
accordingly  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with the framework established in income taxes accounting guidance 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to recognize the extent to which  more likely than not  the future tax benefits will not be realized 
if our near term forecasts are not achieved  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
this could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in a particular period 
share based compensation we account for share based awards in accordance with the framework established in the share based compensation guidance 
share based compensation is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of equity awards using a binomial model 
the binomial model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected life  stock price volatility and the forfeiture rate 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
accounting for goodwill we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we have five reporting units for the purposes of assessing goodwill payless domestic  payless international  plg wholesale  plg retail  and collective licensing 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its book value 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and the company must complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the book value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

table of contents fair value of the reporting units is determined using a combined income and market approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the market approach may involve use of the guideline transaction method  the guideline company method  or both 
the guideline transaction method makes use of available transaction price data of companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business as the respective reporting unit 
the guideline company method uses market multiples of publicly traded companies with operating characteristics similar to the respective reporting unit 
we consider value indications from both the income approach and market approach in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit in our analysis 
we also compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization plus a control premium at each reporting period 
management judgment is a significant factor in determining whether an indicator of impairment has occurred 
management relies on estimates in determining the fair value of each reporting unit  which include the following critical quantitative factors anticipated future cash flows and long term growth rates for each reporting unit 
the income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows  including an estimate of long term growth rates 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of expected changes in operating margins 
our projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
actual results could vary significantly from estimates 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is subject to changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in our industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate could change 
our goodwill balance was million as of january  goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level  which may be the same as a reporting segment or a level below a reporting segment 
the goodwill balance by reporting segment and reporting unit as of january  is as follows reporting segment reporting unit goodwill balance in millions plg wholesale plg wholesale payless domestic collective licensing payless domestic payless domestic total we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
a change in circumstances  a change in strategic direction or a change in the competitive or economic environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units in the future 
the fair value of the collective licensing and payless domestic reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value 
for the plg wholesale reporting unit  a basis point decrease in the long term growth rate  holding all other variables constant  would result in a deficit between the fair value and the carrying value of approximately million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate used in determining the fair value of our reporting unit  holding all other variables constant  would result in a deficit between the fair value and the carrying value of approximately million 
accounting for intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
favorable leases  certain tradenames and other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives using the 
table of contents straight line method 
customer relationships are amortized based on the time period over which the benefits of the asset are expected to occur 
each period we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each intangible asset 
if we were to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
as of january   we had million of indefinite lived tradenames that are not amortized but are assessed for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
the impairment test for indefinite lived tradenames compares each tradename s fair value to its book value 
if the book value of a tradename exceeds its fair value  the tradename is considered impaired and the company recognizes an impairment charge for the difference 
the fair values of our tradenames are determined using the relief from royalty method  which is a form of the income approach 
this method is based on the theory that the owner of the tradename is relieved of paying a royalty or license fee for the use of the tradename 
management judgment is a significant factor in determining whether an indicator of impairment for tradenames has occurred 
management relies on estimates in determining the fair value of each tradename  which include the following critical quantitative factors anticipated future revenues and long term growth rates for each tradename 
the relief from royalty approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future revenues  including an estimate of long term growth rates 
the company s projections of future revenues are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
actual results could vary significantly from estimates 
reasonable market royalty rate for each tradename 
the relief from royalty approach to determining fair value requires selection of appropriate royalty rates for each tradename 
the rates selected depend upon  among other things  licensing agreements involving similar tradenames  historical and forecasted operating profit for each tradename and qualitative factors such as market awareness  history  longevity  and market size 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that these royalty rates could change 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the relief from royalty approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is subject to changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in the company s industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate could change 
we performed our annual intangible asset impairment test in the third quarter of and concluded that there was no impairment of our intangible assets 
the following table highlights the potential impairment charge related to changes in certain key assumptions used in determining the fair value of these tradenames  assuming all other assumptions remain constant 
the potential impairment charge represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
potential impairment charge dollars in millions decrease of basis points in royalty rate decrease of basis points in average growth rate increase of basis points in the discount rate in future periods  if our goodwill or our indefinite lived tradenames were to become impaired  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents accounting for derivatives we participate in interest rate related derivative instruments to manage our exposure on our debt instruments and forward contracts to hedge a portion of certain foreign currency purchases 
we record all derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value in accordance with the framework established for derivatives and hedging and the framework established for fair value measurements and disclosures 
for interest rate contracts  we use a mark to market valuation technique based on an observable interest rate yield curve and adjust for credit risk 
for foreign currency contracts  we use a mark to market valuation technique based on observable foreign currency exchange rates and adjust for credit risk 
changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded either through net earnings loss or as other comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedge designation 
gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item 
as of january   a basis point increase in libor on the unhedged portion of the company s debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately million annually or approximately million per quarter 
accounting for contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
except for income tax contingencies  we record accruals for contingencies to the extent that we conclude that their occurrence is probable and that the related liabilities are estimable and we record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when assured of recovery 
we consider many factors in making these assessments including the progress of the case  opinions or views of legal counsel  prior case law  the experience of the company or other companies in similar cases  and our intent on how to respond 
because litigation and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur  these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
new accounting standards see note of the consolidated financial statements for new accounting standards  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest on our revolving loan facility  which is entirely comprised of a revolving line of credit  is based on the london inter bank offered rate libor plus a variable margin of to  or the base rate  as defined in the credit agreement 
there are no outstanding borrowings on the revolving loan facility at january   however  if we were to borrow against our revolving loan facility  borrowing costs may fluctuate depending upon the volatility of libor 
on august   we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement for million to hedge a portion of our variable rate term loan facility 
as of january   we have hedged million of our term loan facility 
the interest rate swap provides for a fixed interest rate of approximately  portions of which mature on a series of dates through may of the unhedged portion of the term loan facility is subject to interest rate risk depending on the volatility of libor 
as of january   a basis point increase in libor on the unhedged portion of the company s debt  which totals million  would impact pretax interest expense by approximately million annually or approximately million per quarter 
foreign currency risk we have operations in foreign countries  therefore  our cash flows in us dollars are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we adjust our retail prices  when possible  to reflect changes in exchange rates to mitigate this risk 
to further mitigate this risk  we may  from time to time  enter into forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies 
for the weeks ended january   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our operations or cash flows 

table of contents a significant percentage of our footwear is sourced from the people s republic of china the prc 
the national currency of the prc  the yuan  is currently not a freely convertible currency 
the value of the yuan depends to a large extent on the prc government s policies and upon the prc s domestic and international economic and political developments 
since  the official exchange rate for the conversion of the prc s currency was pegged to the us dollar at a virtually fixed rate of approximately yuan per us dollar 
however  during  the prc s government revalued the yuan and adopted a more flexible system based on a trade weighted basket of foreign currencies of the prc s main trading partners 
under the new managed float policy  the exchange rate of the yuan may shift each day up to in either direction from the previous day s close  and as a result  the valuation of the yuan may increase incrementally over time should the prc central bank allow it to do so  which could significantly increase the cost of the products we source from the prc 
as of january   the last day of trading in our fiscal year  the exchange rate was yuan per us dollar compared to yuan per us dollar at the end of our fiscal year and yuan per us dollar at the end of our fiscal year
