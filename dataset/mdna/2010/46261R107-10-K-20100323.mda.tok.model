we ended fiscal with approximately million in sales  a decline of from the prior year 
we reported net income of approximately million as compared to a net loss of million in comparable store sales in decreased compared to sales in  which was within the range experienced by many other specialty stores in comparable store sales are defined as sales from those stores open for at least one full year 
we offset our same store sales performance with the successful operation of temporary halloween stores and through our strategic cost reductions  initiated at the beginning of our cost reductions achieved savings in almost every area of company operations  including store payroll  advertising and marketing  non payroll operating expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
for the first quarter of  our consolidated revenues were million  compared to million for the first quarter of the decrease in first quarter revenues from the year ago period included a decrease in comparable store sales from stores open more than one year

at the end of  we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in in accordance with section of the internal revenue code  the use of these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations based upon certain ownership changes of our stock that may have occurred or that may occur 
net income loss our net loss in was  or net loss per basic and diluted share  compared to net income of  or net income per basic and diluted share  in critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
inventory and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory our inventory consists of party supplies and is valued at the lower of moving weighted average cost or market which approximates fifo first in  first out 
we record vendor rebates  discounts and certain other adjustments to inventory  including freight costs  and we recognize these amounts in the income statement as the related goods are sold 
during each interim reporting period  we estimate the impact on cost of products sold associated with inventory shortage 
the actual inventory shortage is determined upon reconciliation of the annual physical inventory  which occurs shortly before and after our year end  and an adjustment to cost of products sold is recorded at the end of the fourth quarter to recognize the difference between the estimated and actual inventory shortage for the full year 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of goods sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
we also make adjustments to reduce the value of our inventory for an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  which is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future sales 
we conduct reviews periodically throughout the year on each stock keeping unit sku 
as we identify obsolete and excess inventory  we take immediate measures to reduce our inventory risk on these items and we adjust our allowance accordingly 
thus  actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
we estimate returns based upon historical return rates and such amounts have not been significant 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of the values of two non compete agreements acquired in conjunction with the purchase of retail stores in and  and the values of retail store leases acquired in those transactions 
the first non compete agreement  from party city corporation and its affiliates  covers massachusetts  maine  new hampshire  vermont  rhode island  and windsor and new london counties in connecticut  and expires in the second non compete agreement was acquired in connection with our purchase in january of two franchised party supply stores in lincoln and warwick  rhode island 
the acquired rhode island stores had been operated as party city franchise stores  and were converted to iparty stores immediately following the closing 
the second non compete agreement covers rhode island for five years from the date of closing and within a certain distance from our stores in the rest of new england for three years 
both non compete agreements have an estimated life of months and are subject to certain terms and conditions in their respective acquisition agreements 
the occupancy valuations related to acquired retail store leases are for stores in peabody  massachusetts estimated life of months  lincoln  rhode island estimated life of months and warwick  rhode island estimated life of months 
intangible assets also include legal and other transaction costs incurred related to the purchase of the peabody  lincoln and warwick stores 
non compete agreements are amortized based on the pattern of their expected cash flow benefits 
occupancy valuations are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
impairment of long lived assets in connection with our ongoing long lived asset assessment  we perform a review of each store for impairment indicators whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable from estimated future store cash flows 
our review considers store operating results  future sales growth and cash flows 
the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from current estimates if underlying assumptions or business strategies change 
we closed two stores in early january  at the end of their lease terms 
no impairment charges were required for these stores  as the assets related to them have been fully amortized  except for immaterial amounts  and no liability existed for future lease costs 
we are not aware of any impairment indicators for any of our remaining stores at december  income taxes historically  we have not recognized an income tax benefit for our losses 
accordingly  we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of future taxable income and the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in determining if a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset is appropriate  we consider both positive and negative evidence 
the positive evidence that we considered included we were profitable in  and  we have achieved positive comparable store sales growth for six out of the last eight years  we were able to significantly reduce store and headquarters operating expenses in  and we were able to use federal net operating loss deductions in each tax year from through  and expect to do so for tax year the negative evidence that we considered included we realized a net loss in and  our merchandise margins decreased in   and  our future profitability is vulnerable to certain risks  including a the risk that we may not be able to generate significant taxable income to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december   b the risk of unseasonable weather and other factors in a single geographic region  new england  where our stores are concentrated  c the risk of being so dependent upon a single season  halloween  for a significant amount of annual sales and profitability and d the risk of fluctuating prices for petroleum products  which are a key raw material for much of our merchandise and which affect our freight costs and those of our suppliers and affect our customers spending levels and patterns  the costs that opening or acquiring new stores will put pressure on our profit margins until these stores reach maturity  the expected costs of increased regulatory compliance  including  without limitation  those associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act  will likely have a negative impact on our profitability  the risk that a continued  general or perceived slowdown in the u 
s economy  or uncertainty as to the economic outlook  which the us and world economies have recently experienced  could continue to reduce discretionary spending or cause a shift in consumer discretionary spending to other products 
the positive evidence is strong enough for us to conclude that we will realize sufficient levels of taxable income in to support the release of a portion of the related reserves in fiscal however  we believe that it is prudent for us to maintain a valuation allowance against our remaining deferred tax assets until we have a longer track record of profitability and we can reduce our exposure to the risks described above 
should we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would increase income in the period we made such a determination 
stock option compensation expense we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based compensation 
the black scholes model requires us to make several subjective assumptions  including the estimated length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  which is based on historical volatility of our common stock over a time period equal to the expected term 
the black scholes model also requires a risk free interest rate  which is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant  and the dividend yield on our common stock  which is assumed to be zero since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each grant 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ from our estimates

liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  including purchases under our supply agreement with amscan  as described more fully below  occupancy expenses of our stores  employee salaries  and new and temporary store openings  including acquisitions 
our primary sources of cash are cash from operating activities  and debt  including our line of credit and note payable 
our prospective cash flows are subject to certain trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  improve our infrastructure  respond to economic conditions  and meet contractual commitments 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that anticipated revenues from operations and borrowings available under our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital requirements  scheduled note payment as discussed below  and capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
in the event that our operating plan changes due to changes in our strategic plans  lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses  increased competition  unfavorable economic conditions  declines in consumer confidence and spending  or other unforeseen circumstances  our liquidity may be negatively impacted 
if so  we could be required to adjust our expenditures for to conserve working capital or raise additional capital  possibly including debt or equity financing and to fund operations and our business strategy 
given the current state of the debt and equity markets  this could be difficult and expensive  and we might not be able to do so on terms acceptable to us 
notes payable at the beginning of our fiscal year  we had three notes payable outstanding 
we refer to these notes as the highbridge note  the amscan note and the party city note 
for a more detailed description of these notes  we refer you to the section titled notes payable in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in item of this annual report on form k 
in the third quarter of  we paid in full the highbridge note and the amscan note 
the highbridge note was paid off through additional borrowings under our line of credit with wells fargo 
the amscan note was payable in monthly installments  the last of which was paid in september  at december  only the party city note  with a principal balance of  remained outstanding 
the full principal amount is due at the note s maturity on august  in connection with the issuance of the highbridge note  we also issued a warrant  the highbridge warrant  exercisable for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  or of the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately prior to the closing of the transaction 
the agreements entered into in connection with the financing granted highbridge resale registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the highbridge warrant and provide for certain anti dilution rights and other covenants with respect to the listing of our common stock 
the issuance of the highbridge warrant triggered certain anti dilution provisions of our series b  c  and d convertible preferred stock 
line of credit on july   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the new line with wells fargo retail finance  llc wells fargo  which amended and restated the previous revolving credit facility with wells fargo 
the new line continues the revolving line of credit in the amount of up to  and extends the maturity date for three years to july  as with the previous line with wells fargo  the new line includes an option whereby we may increase the revolving line of credit up to a maximum level of  at any time prior to july  the amount of credit that is available from time to time under the agreement is determined as a percentage of the value of eligible inventory plus a percentage of the value of eligible credit card receivables  as reduced by certain reserve amounts that may be required by wells fargo 
borrowings under the new line will generally accrue interest at a margin ranging from to determined according to the average daily excess availability during the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the adjustment date over  at our election  either the london interbank offered rate libor or a base rate determined by wells fargo from time to time 
the new line margins are an increase over the previous line  and may result in an increase in overall borrowing cost under the new line 
the new line also provides for letters of credit for up to a sublimit of million to be used in connection with inventory purchases and includes an unused line fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit line 
the new line also provided for a closing fee of  which was paid to wells fargo at closing 
our obligations under the new line continue to be secured by a lien on substantially all of our personal property 
our inventory consists of party supplies which are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market  which approximates fifo first in  first out and are reduced by an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory and are further reduced or increased by other adjustments  including vendor rebates and discounts and freight costs 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against acceptable inventory at cost  which is based on our inventory at cost and applies adjustments that our lender has approved  which may be different than adjustments we use for valuing our inventory in our financial statements  such as the adjustment to reserve for inventory shortage 
the amount of acceptable inventory at cost was approximately  at december  our accounts receivable consist primarily of credit card receivables and vendor rebates receivable 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against eligible credit card receivables  which are the credit card receivables for the previous two to three days of business 
the amount of eligible credit card receivables was approximately  at december  our total borrowing base is determined by adding the acceptable inventory at cost times an agreed upon advance rate plus the eligible credit card receivables times an agreed upon advance rate but not to exceed our established credit limit  which was  at december  under the terms of our line of credit  our  credit limit was further reduced by a minimum availability block  customer deposits  gift certificates  merchandise credits and outstanding letters of credit 
the amounts outstanding under our line were  at december  and  as of december   an increase of  our additional availability was  at december  and  at december  the outstanding balances under our line are classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because we are required to apply daily lock box receipts to reduce the amount outstanding 
as with the previous line  the new line has financial covenants that are limited to minimum availability and capital expenditures and contains various restrictive covenants  such as incurrence  payment or entry into certain indebtedness  liens  investments  acquisitions  mergers  dispositions and dividends 
under the new line  we are required to maintain a minimum availability of of the credit limit  which is an increase from the previous requirement of and  consistent with the previous line  to limit our capital expenditures to within of those amounts included in our business plan  which may be updated from time to time 
at december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
the new line contains events of default customary for credit facilities of this type 
upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods  in addition to other remedies that may be available to wells fargo  the obligations under the new line may be accelerated  outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and the lenders may exercise remedies to collect the balance due  including to foreclose on the collateral 
should the new line be prepaid or the maturity accelerated for any reason  we would be responsible for an early termination fee in the amount of i of the revolving credit facility ceiling then in effect within the first year of the term of the facility  ii of the revolving credit facility ceiling then in effect within the second year of the term of the facility and iii thereafter 
supply agreement with amscan our supply agreement with amscan gives us the right to receive certain additional rebates and more favorable pricing terms over the term of the agreement than generally were available to us under our previous terms with amscan 
the right to receive additional rebates  and the amount of such rebates  are subject to our achievement of increased levels of purchases and other factors provided for in the supply agreement 
in exchange  the supply agreement obligates us to purchase increased levels of merchandise from amscan until beginning with calendar year  the supply agreement requires us to purchase on an annual basis merchandise equal to the total number of our stores open during such calendar year  multiplied by  the supply agreement provides for penalties in the event we fail to attain the annual purchase commitment that would require us to pay amscan the difference between the purchases for that year and the annual purchase commitment for that year 
under the terms of the supply agreement  the annual purchase commitment for any individual year can be reduced for orders placed by us but not filled by the supplier 
during  the supplier experienced difficulty in fulfilling certain of our orders sourced out of china 
accordingly  the supplier agreed to reduce our purchase commitment for to of the contractual minimum for that year 
our purchases for exceeded the minimum purchase amount commitments  as adjusted  under the supply agreement 
our purchases for fell short of the annual commitment by approximately  the supplier has agreed to allow us to roll over any shortfall for the year into future years requirements 
we are not aware of any reason that would prevent us from meeting the minimum purchase requirements  including the shortfall  for the remainder of the term of the supply agreement 
although we do not expect to incur any penalties under this supply agreement  if they were to occur  there could be a material adverse effect on our uses and sources of cash 
operating  investing and financing activities our operating activities provided  in compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net income in  offset by an increase in prepaid expenses at the end of compared to the increase in prepaid expense at the end of was the result of the timing of january rent payments compared to the prior year 
we used  in investing activities in compared to  in  a decrease of  the cash invested in was primarily due to the modification of our internal systems to improve our compliance with payment card industry data security standards  store improvements and the relocation of our walpole store to a new  larger location 
the cash invested in was primarily due to the acquisition in january of two retail stores located in rhode island and the related non compete agreement see discussion below 
we used  in financing activities in compared to  during  an increase of  the increase was primarily related to the repayment of the highbridge note payable in september contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period within year within years within years after years total line of credit capital lease obligations notes payable supply agreement operating leases including retail space leases total contractual obligations in addition  at december   we had outstanding purchase orders totaling approximately  for the acquisition of inventory and non inventory items that were scheduled for delivery after december  acquisitions we operate in a largely un branded market that has many small businesses 
as a result  we have considered  and may continue to consider  growing our business through acquisitions of other entities 
any determination to make an acquisition will be based upon a variety of factors  including  without limitation  the purchase price and other financial terms of the transaction  the business prospects  geographical location and the extent to which any acquisition would enhance our prospects on january   we completed the purchase of two retail stores located in rhode island and a related non compete agreement
