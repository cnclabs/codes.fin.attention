table of contents avista corporation avista utilities general through our regulated utility operations  we generate  transmit and distribute electricity and distribute natural gas 
retail electric and natural gas customers include residential  commercial and industrial classifications 
we also engage in wholesale purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas as an integral part of energy resource management and our load serving obligation 
our utility provides electric distribution and transmission  as well as natural gas distribution services in parts of eastern washington and northern idaho 
we also provide natural gas distribution service in parts of northeast and southwest oregon 
at the end of  we supplied retail electric service to  customers and retail natural gas service to  customers across our entire service territory 
see item properties for further information on our utility assets 
electric operations in addition to providing electric distribution and transmission services  we generate electricity from facilities that we own and we purchase capacity and energy and fuel for generation under long term and short term contracts 
we also sell capacity and energy  and surplus fuel in the wholesale market in connection with our resource optimization activities as described below 
as part of our resource procurement and management operations in the electric business  we engage in an ongoing process of resource optimization  which involves the economic selection from available energy resources to serve our load obligations and the use of these resources to capture available economic value 
we sell and purchase wholesale electric capacity and energy and fuel as part of the process of acquiring and balancing resources to serve our load obligations 
these transactions range from terms of one hour up to multiple years 
we make continuing projections of electric loads at various points in time ranging from one hour to multiple years based on  among other things  estimates of customer usage and weather  historical data and contract terms  and resource availability at these points in time based on  among other things  fuel choices and fuel markets  estimates of streamflows  availability of generating units  historic and forward market information  contract terms  and experience 
on the basis of these projections  we make purchases and sales of electric capacity and energy and fuel to match expected resources to expected electric load requirements 
resource optimization involves generating plant dispatch and scheduling available resources and also includes transactions such as purchasing fuel for generation  when economical  selling fuel and substituting wholesale electric purchases  and other wholesale transactions to capture the value of generation and transmission resources 
our optimization process includes entering into hedging transactions to manage risks 
our generation assets are interconnected through the regional transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to enhance load serving capability and reliability 
we provide transmission and ancillary services in eastern washington  northern idaho and western montana 
our open access same time information system oasis is part of the joint transmission services information network that covers much of the united states 
transmission revenues were million in  million in and million in electric requirements our peak electric native load requirement for occurred on december  at which time our total load was  mw consisting of native load of  mw  long term wholesale obligations of mw  and short term wholesale obligations of mw 
at that time our maximum resource capacity available was  mw  which included company owned electric generation of  mw  long term hydroelectric contracts with certain public utility districts puds of mw  other long term wholesale contracts of mw  and short term wholesale purchases of mw 

table of contents avista corporation electric resources we have a diverse electric resource mix of hydroelectric projects  thermal generating facilities  and power purchases and exchanges 
at the end of  our facilities had a total net capability of  mw  of which percent was hydroelectric and percent was thermal 
see item properties for detailed information on generating facilities 
hydroelectric resources we own and operate six hydroelectric projects on the spokane river and two hydroelectric projects on the clark fork river 
hydroelectric generation is our lowest cost source per megawatt hour mwh of electricity and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a significant effect on total power supply costs 
under normal streamflow and operating conditions  we estimate that we would be able to meet approximately one half of our total average electric requirements both retail and long term wholesale with the combination of our hydroelectric generation and long term hydroelectric purchase contracts with certain puds in the state of washington 
our estimate of normal annual hydroelectric generation for including resources purchased under long term hydroelectric contracts with certain puds is average megawatts amw or million mwhs

coyote springs  which is operated by portland general electric company  is supplied with natural gas under both term contracts and spot market purchases  including transportation agreements with unilateral renewal rights 
colstrip  which is operated by ppl montana  llc  is supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under coal supply and transportation agreements in effect through the primary fuel for the kettle falls gs is wood waste generated as a by product and delivered by trucks from forest industry operations within miles of the plant 
natural gas may be used as an alternate fuel 
a combination of long term contracts and spot purchases has provided  and is expected to meet  fuel requirements for the kettle falls gs 
the northeast ct  rathdrum ct  boulder park and kettle falls ct generating units are primarily used to meet peaking electric requirements 
we also operate these facilities when marginal costs are below prevailing wholesale electric prices 
we did not operate these generating units significantly in  and these generating facilities have access to natural gas supplies that are adequate to meet their respective operating needs 

table of contents avista corporation the following table shows our thermal generation in thousands of mwhs during the year ended december coyote springs colstrip kettle falls gs northeast ct and rathdrum ct boulder park and kettle falls ct total thermal generation purchases  exchanges and sales we purchase and sell power under various long term contracts 
we also enter into short term purchases and sales 
see electric operations for additional information with respect to the use of wholesale purchases and sales as part of our resource optimization process 
pursuant to the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  as amended by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc as required by the energy policy act of energy policy act  we are required to purchase generation from qualifying facilities 
this includes small hydroelectric and cogeneration projects at rates approved by the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the idaho public utilities commission ipuc 
these contracts expire at various times between and these contracts were not a significant source of power resources in  and see avista utilities operating statistics electric operations electric energy resources for annual quantities of purchased power  wholesale power sales and power from exchanges in  and hydroelectric licensing we are a licensee under the federal power act as administered by the ferc  which includes regulation of hydroelectric generation resources 
except for the little falls plant  all of our hydroelectric plants are regulated by the ferc through project licenses 
the licensed projects are subject to the provisions of part i of the federal power act 
these provisions include payment for headwater benefits  condemnation of licensed projects upon payment of just compensation  and take over of such projects after the expiration of the license upon payment of the lesser of net investment or fair value of the project  in either case  plus severance damages 
in march  we received a year operating license from the ferc for the cabinet gorge hydroelectric generating project cabinet gorge and the noxon rapids hydroelectric generating project noxon rapids 
as part of the clark fork settlement agreement  we initiated the implementation of protection  mitigation and enhancement measures in march measures in the agreement address issues related to fisheries  water quality  wildlife  recreation  land use  cultural resources and erosion 
see clark fork settlement agreement in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of dissolved atmospheric gas levels that exceed state of idaho and federal water quality standards downstream of cabinet gorge during periods when we must divert excess river flows over the spillway and our mitigation plans and efforts 
we own and operate six hydroelectric plants on the spokane river 
five of these long lake  nine mile  upper falls  monroe street  and post falls  which have a total present capability of mw are under one ferc license and are referred to as the spokane river project 
the sixth  little falls  is operated under separate congressional authority and is not licensed by the ferc 
the ferc issued a new year license for the spokane river project on june  the license incorporated certain conditions that were included in the december settlement agreement with united states department of interior doi and the coeur d alene tribe the tribe  as well as the mandatory conditions that were agreed to in the idaho water quality certifications and in the amended washington water quality certification 
various issues that were appealed under the washington water quality certification were subsequently resolved through settlement 
as part of the settlement agreement with the washington department of ecology doe  we are currently engaged with the doe and the environmental protection agency epa total maximum daily load tmdl process for the spokane river and lake spokane  the reservoir created by long lake dam 
on february   the doe submitted the tmdl for the epa s review and approval 
once the tmdl process is completed  and our level of responsibility related to low dissolved oxygen in lake spokane is established  we will identify potential mitigation measures 
it is not possible to provide cost estimates at this time because the mitigation measures have not been fully indentified or approved by the doe 
it is also possible the tmdl will be appealed by one or more parties if it is approved by the epa 
we are implementing the environmental and operational conditions required in the license for the spokane river project 
the estimated cost to implement the license conditions for the five hydroelectric plants is million over the 
table of contents avista corporation year license term 
this will increase the spokane river project s cost of power by about percent  while decreasing annual generation by approximately one half of one percent 
costs to implement mitigation measures related to the tmdl are not included in these cost estimates 
the ipuc and the wutc approved the recovery of licensing costs through general rate cases in we will continue to seek recovery  through the ratemaking process  of all operating and capitalized costs related to the licensing of the spokane river project 
future resource needs we have operational strategies to provide sufficient resources to meet our energy requirements under a range of operating conditions 
these operational strategies consider the amount of energy needed over hourly  daily  monthly and annual durations  which vary widely because of the factors that influence demand 
our average hourly load was  amw in   amw in and  amw in the following is a forecast of our average annual energy requirements and resources for   and forecasted electric energy requirements and resources amw requirements system load contracts for power sales total requirements resources company owned and contract hydro generation company owned base load thermal generation company owned other thermal generation contracts for power purchases total resources surplus resources additional available energy total surplus resources the forecast assumes near normal hydroelectric generation decline is related to changes in contracts with puds 
excludes the northeast ct and rathdrum ct 
we generally use these resources to meet electric load requirements due to either below normal hydroelectric generation or increased loads or outages at other generating facilities  and or when operating costs are lower than short term wholesale market prices 
northeast ct and rathdrum ct 
the combined maximum capacity of the northeast ct and rathdrum ct is mw  with estimated available energy production as indicated for each year 
in the third quarter of  we filed our electric integrated resource plan irp with the wutc and the ipuc 
the irp identifies a strategic resource portfolio that meets future electric load requirements  promotes environmental stewardship and meets our obligation to provide reliable electric service to customers at rates  terms and conditions that are fair  just  reasonable and sufficient 
we regard the irp as a tool for resource evaluation  rather than an acquisition plan for a particular project 
highlights of the irp include up to mw of wind power by which equates to approximately average megawatts  an additional mw of wind power by  mw of clean burning natural gas fired generation facilities  aggressive energy efficiency measures to reduce generation requirements by percent or mw  transmission upgrades to integrate new generation resources into our system  and hydroelectric upgrades at existing facilities to generate additional renewable energy 
we are subject to washington state renewable energy portfolio standards and must obtain a portion of our electricity from qualifying renewable resources or through purchase of renewable energy credits 
our irp identified that additional qualifying renewable energy is needed by and that new capacity and energy resources are needed by based on resource acquisition goals identified in the irp  we evaluated proposals from suppliers to provide us with up to average megawatts which equates to approximately mw of wind power of long term qualified renewable energy by the end of 
table of contents avista corporation in  we completed the acquisition of the development rights for a wind generation site 
we considered developing this site and or acquiring additional renewable resources a few years early by taking advantage of certain federal and state tax incentives 
however  after detailed analysis  we decided to postpone renewable resource acquisitions  including the potential construction of a wind generation project until the timeframe 
future generation resource decisions will be impacted by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy requirements 
the lancaster plant is a mw natural gas fired combined cycle combustion turbine plant located in idaho  owned by an unrelated third party 
all of the output from the lancaster plant is contracted to avista turbine power  inc atp  an affiliate of avista energy  through under a power purchase agreement 
atp conveyed the majority of its rights and obligations under this agreement to shell energy through the end of atp conveyed these rights and obligations to avista corp 
avista utilities beginning in january in idaho  the net costs of the lancaster power purchase agreement were determined to be prudent by the ipuc and are currently being recovered through the power cost adjustment mechanism 
we will include recovery of the net costs in base rates in our next general rate case filing 
in washington  the wutc approved deferral of the net costs subject to a future determination of the power purchase agreement being a prudent resource acquisition  and review and approval of the costs in our next general rate case filing 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental issues and other contingencies for information related existing laws  as well as potential legislation that could influence our future electric resource mix 
natural gas operations general we provide natural gas distribution services to retail customers in parts of eastern washington  northern idaho  and parts of northeast and southwest oregon 
market prices for natural gas  like other commodities  continue to be volatile 
to provide reliable supply and to manage the impact of volatile prices on our customers  we procure natural gas through a diversified mix of spot market purchases and forward fixed price purchases from various supply basins and over various time periods 
we also use natural gas storage capacity to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices may be seasonally lower 
securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years mitigates potential adverse impacts of significant purchase requirements in a volatile price environment 
as part of the process of balancing natural gas retail load requirements with resources  we engage in wholesale purchases and sales of natural gas 
we also optimize natural gas resources by using excess resources and market opportunities to generate economic value that reduces retail rates 
wholesale sales are delivered through wholesale market facilities outside of our natural gas distribution system 
we make continuing projections of our natural gas loads and assess available natural gas resources 
forward natural gas contracts are typically for monthly delivery periods 
however  daily variations in natural gas demand can be significantly different than monthly demand projections 
on the basis of these projections  we plan and execute a series of transactions to hedge a significant portion of our projected natural gas requirements through forward market transactions and derivative instruments 
these transactions may extend as much as four years into the future with the highest volumes hedged for the current and most immediately upcoming natural gas operating year november through october 
we also purchase a significant portion of our natural gas supply requirements in short term and spot markets 
natural gas resource optimization activities include wholesale market sales of surplus natural gas supplies  purchases and sales of natural gas to use underutilized pipeline capacity  and sales of excess natural gas storage capacity 
we also provide transportation service to certain large commercial and industrial natural gas customers who purchase natural gas through third party marketers 
for these customers  we move their natural gas through our distribution system from natural gas transmission pipeline delivery points to the customers premises 
the total volume transported on behalf of our transportation customers for  and was  and million therms  representing percent  percent and percent of total system deliveries 
natural gas supply we purchase all of our natural gas in wholesale markets 
we are connected to multiple supply basins in the western united states and western canada through firm capacity delivery rights on six pipeline networks 
access to this diverse portfolio of natural gas resources allows us to make natural gas procurement decisions that benefit our natural gas customers 
we have interstate pipeline capacity to serve approximately percent of natural gas supplies 
table of contents avista corporation from domestic sources  with the remaining percent from canadian sources 
natural gas prices in the pacific northwest are affected by global energy markets  as well as supply and demand factors in other regions of the united states and canada 
future prices and delivery constraints may cause our source mix to vary 
natural gas storage we own a one third interest in the jackson prairie natural gas storage project jackson prairie  an underground natural gas storage field located near chehalis  washington 
jackson prairie has a total peak day deliverability of million therms  with a total working natural gas capacity of million therms 
we also contract with northwest natural gas for storage at the mist natural gas storage facility 
this contract is for million therms of capacity and up to million therms of deliverability 
this contract expires on march  natural gas storage enables us to place natural gas into storage when prices may be lower or to satisfy minimum natural gas purchasing requirements  as well as to meet high demand periods or to withdraw natural gas from storage when spot prices are higher 
avista energy controls million therms of our capacity at jackson prairie and in conjunction with the asset sales agreement has assigned this capacity to shell energy through april  after that date  it is our intent to transfer this capacity to avista utilities for use in utility operations subject to state regulatory approval 
regulatory issues general as a regulated public utility  we are subject to regulation by state utility commissions for prices  accounting  the issuance of securities and other matters 
the retail electric and natural gas operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the wutc  the ipuc  the public utility commission of oregon opuc  and the public service commission of the state of montana montana commission 
approval of the issuance of securities is not required from the montana commission 
we are also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc for licensing of hydroelectric generation resources  and for electric transmission service and wholesale sales 
our rates for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval are determined on a cost of service basis 
rates are designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses  an opportunity for us to earn a reasonable return on rate base 
rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost net of accumulated depreciation of utility plant in service  subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items 
over time  rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write offs as authorized by the utility commissions 
in general  a request for new rates is made on the basis of net investment  operating expenses and revenues as of a date prior to the date of the request 
although the current ratemaking process provides recovery of some future changes in net investment  operating costs and revenues  it does not reflect all changes in costs for the period in which new retail rates will be in place 
this results in a lag between the time we incur costs and the time when we can start recovering the costs through rates 
our rates for wholesale electric and natural gas transmission services are based on either cost of service principles or market based rates as set forth by the ferc 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about regulation  depreciation and deferred income taxes 
general rate cases we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters general rate cases for information on general rate case activity 
power cost deferrals we defer the recognition in the income statement of certain power supply costs that vary from the level currently recovered from our retail customers as authorized by the wutc and the ipuc 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in washington and idaho 
purchased gas adjustment pga under established regulatory practices in each respective state  we are allowed to adjust natural gas rates periodically with regulatory approval to reflect increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas purchased 
differences between actual natural gas costs and the natural gas costs included in retail rates are deferred and charged or credited to expense when regulators approve inclusion of the cost changes in rates 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters purchased gas adjustments and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on natural gas cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in washington  idaho and oregon 

table of contents avista corporation federal laws related to wholesale competition federal law promotes practices that open the electric wholesale energy market to competition 
the ferc requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  and requires electric utilities to enhance or construct transmission facilities to create additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services 
public utilities through subsidiaries and other entities may participate in the development of independent electric generating plants for sales to wholesale customers 
public utilities operating under the federal power act are required to provide open and non discriminatory access to their transmission systems to third parties and establish an oasis to provide an electronic means by which transmission customers can obtain information about available transmission capacity and purchase transmission access 
the ferc also requires each public utility subject to the rules to operate its transmission and wholesale power merchant operating functions separately and to comply with standards of conduct designed to ensure that all wholesale users  including the public utility s power merchant operations  have equal access to the public utility s transmission system 
our compliance with these standards has not had any substantive impact on the operation  maintenance and marketing of our transmission system or our ability to provide service to customers 
regional transmission organizations ferc order no 
issued in required all utilities subject to ferc regulation to file a proposal to form a regional transmission organization rto  or a description of efforts to participate in an rto  and any existing obstacles to rto participation 
while it has not formally withdrawn order no 
 the ferc issued orders and made public policy statements indicating its support for the development and formation of regional independently governed transmission organizations developed by such regions  but that do not necessarily meet all of the rto functions and characteristics outlined in order no 
these include ferc order no 
issued in  which required transmission providers to implement a number of regional transmission planning coordination requirements 
we have participated in discussions with transmission providers and other stakeholders in the pacific northwest for several years regarding the possible formation of an rto in the region 
columbiagrid  a washington nonprofit membership corporation  was formed to improve the operational efficiency  reliability  and planned expansion of the transmission grid in the pacific northwest 
columbiagrid members  including avista corp  elected an independent slate of directors to a three member board in august columbiagrid s members and stakeholders continue to publicly assess new responsibilities and functions that columbiagrid may undertake 
columbiagrid s transmission planning and expansion functional agreement was accepted by the ferc and was signed by a number of pacific northwest parties  including avista corp 
we will continue to assess the benefits of entering into other functional agreements with columbiagrid 
reliability standards among its other provisions  the energy policy act provided for the implementation of mandatory reliability standards and authorized the ferc to assess fines for non compliance with these standards and other ferc regulations 
the ferc subsequently certified the north american electricity reliability council nerc as the single electric reliability organization authorized to establish and enforce reliability standards and delegate authority to regional entities for the purpose of establishing and enforcing reliability standards 
as of january  the ferc has approved nerc reliability standards  including nine western region standards  making up the set of legally enforceable standards for the united states bulk electric system 
the first of these reliability standards became effective in june we are required to self certify our compliance with these standards on an annual basis and undergo regularly scheduled periodic reviews by the nerc and its regional entity  the western electricity coordinating council wecc 
our failure to comply with these standards could result in financial penalties of up to million per day per violation 
we have continued to successfully demonstrate our compliance with these standards 
environmental issues we are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the generation  transmission  distribution  service and storage facilities in which we have an ownership interest are designed and operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws 
furthermore  we conduct periodic reviews and audits of pertinent facilities and operations to ensure compliance and to respond to or anticipate emerging environmental issues 
the company s board of directors has a committee to oversee environmental issues

table of contents avista corporation fisheries a number of species of fish in the northwest  including the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon  the kootenai river white sturgeon  the upper columbia river steelhead  the upper columbia river spring chinook salmon and the bull trout  are listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act 
thus far  measures that were adopted and implemented to save the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon have not directly impacted generation levels at any of our hydroelectric facilities 
we purchase power under long term contracts with certain puds on the columbia river that are directly impacted by ongoing mitigation measures for salmon and steelhead 
the reduction in generation at these projects is relatively minor  resulting in minimal economic impact on our operations at this time 
we cannot predict the economic costs to us resulting from future mitigation measures 
we received a year ferc operating license for cabinet gorge and noxon rapids in march that incorporates a comprehensive settlement agreement 
the restoration of native salmonid fish  particularly bull trout  is a key part of the agreement 
the result is a collaborative bull trout recovery program with the us fish and wildlife service  native american tribes and the states of idaho and montana on the lower clark fork river  consistent with requirements of the ferc license 
see hydroelectric licensing for further information 
air quality we must be in compliance with requirements under the clean air act caa and clean air act amendments caaa in operating our thermal generating plants 
we continue to monitor legislative developments at the state and national levels for potential further restrictions on sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide  as well as other greenhouse gas and mercury emissions 
compliance with new and proposed requirements and possible additional legislation or regulations will result in increases to capital expenditures and operating expenses for expanded emission controls at the company s thermal generating facilities 
the most significant impacts on us  related to the caa and the caaa  pertain to colstrip  which is a phase ii coal fired plant for sulfur dioxide so under the caaa 
however  we do not expect colstrip to be required to implement any additional so mitigation in the foreseeable future in order to continue operations 
our other thermal projects are subject to various caaa standards 
every five years each of the other thermal projects requires an updated operating permit known as a title v permit  which addresses  among other things  the compliance of the plant with the caaa 
the operating permit for the rathdrum ct was renewed in expires in and the operating permit for the kettle falls gs was renewed in expires in 
coyote springs was issued a renewed title v permit in that expires in boulder park and the northeast ct do not require a title v permit based on their limited output and instead each has a synthetic minor permit that does not expire 
in  the montana department of environmental quality montana deq adopted final rules for the control of mercury emissions from coal fired plants 
the new rules set strict mercury emission limits by  and put in place a recurring ten year review process to ensure facilities are keeping pace with advancing technology in mercury emission control 
the rules also provide for temporary alternate emission limits provided certain provisions are met  and they allocate mercury emission credits in a manner that rewards the cleanest facilities 
the company  along with the other owners of colstrip  completed the first phase of testing on two mercury control technologies 
the joint owners of colstrip believe  based upon current results  that the plant will be able to comply with the montana law without utilizing the temporary alternate emission limit provision 
current estimates indicate that our share of installation capital costs will be million and annual operating costs will increase by million began in late 
we will continue to seek recovery  through the ratemaking process  of the costs to comply with various air quality requirements 
water quality see clark fork settlement agreement in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding dissolved atmospheric gas levels that exceed state of idaho and federal water quality standards downstream of cabinet gorge 
see spokane river licensing in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the clean water act certifications for our licensing of the spokane river project 
global climate changes rising concerns about long term global climate changes could have a significant effect on our business 
we continue to monitor and evaluate the possible adoption of national  regional  or state requirements related to global climate changes 
these requirements could result in significant costs for us to comply with restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
such requirements could also preclude us from developing certain types of generating plants or entering into new contracts for the output from generating plants that do not meet these requirements

on august   advantage iq acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of ecos consulting  inc ecos  a portland  oregon based energy efficiency solutions provider 
other businesses in periods prior to  we had a reportable energy marketing and resource management segment 
this segment primarily included the results of avista energy 
on june   avista energy and its subsidiary  avista energy canada  completed the sale of substantially all of their contracts and ongoing operations to shell energy  as well as to certain other subsidiaries of shell energy 
completion of this transaction effectively ended the majority of the operations of this business segment 
avista energy canada provided natural gas services to industrial and commercial customers in british columbia  canada 
the historical activities of avista energy included trading electricity and natural gas  the optimization of generation assets owned by other entities  long term electric supply contracts  natural gas storage and electric transmission and natural gas transportation arrangements 
avista energy still owns natural gas storage facilities and we expect these assets to eventually be transferred to our utility operations 
this business had operating revenues and resource costs through the end of related to the power purchase agreement for the lancaster plant 
the rights and obligations related to the power purchase agreement for the lancaster plant were conveyed to avista corp 
avista utilities in january our other businesses include advanced manufacturing and development am d doing business as metalfx  a subsidiary that performs custom sheet metal fabrication of electronic enclosures  parts and systems for the computer  telecom  renewable energy and medical industries 
our other investments and operations include real estate investments primarily commercial office buildings  investments in venture capital funds and low income housing  and the remaining investment in a previous fuel cell subsidiary of the company 
over time as opportunities arise  we dispose of assets and phase out operations that do not fit with our overall corporate strategy 
however  we may invest incremental funds to protect our existing investments and invest in new businesses that fit with our overall corporate strategy

risk factors risk factors the following factors could have a significant impact on our operations  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
these factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including this annual report on form k  and elsewhere 
please also see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements for additional factors which could have a significant impact on our operations  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows and could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements 
weather temperatures and precipitation levels has a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
weather impacts are described in the following subtopics retail electricity and natural gas sales  the cost of natural gas supply  and the cost of power supply 
retail electricity and natural gas sales volumes vary directly with changes in temperatures 
we normally have our highest retail electric and natural gas energy sales during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
we also have high electricity demand for air conditioning during the summer third quarter 
in general  warmer weather in the heating season and cooler weather in the cooling season will reduce our customers energy demand and retail operating revenues 
the cost of natural gas supply tends to increase with increased demand during periods of cold weather 
increased costs may adversely affect cash flows during periods when we purchase natural gas for retail supply at prices above the amount currently allowed for recovery in retail rates 
we defer differences between actual natural gas supply costs and the amount currently recovered in retail rates and we have generally been allowed to recover substantially all of these differences after regulatory review 
however  these deferred costs require cash outflows from the time of natural gas purchases until the costs are later recovered through retail sales 
the cost of power supply can be significantly impacted by weather 
precipitation consisting of snowpack and its melting pattern plus rainfall and other streamflow conditions such as regional water storage operations significantly affect hydroelectric generation capability 
variations in hydroelectric generation inversely affect our reliance on market purchases and thermal generation 
to the extent that hydroelectric generation is less than normal  significantly more costly power supply resources are required and the ability to realize net benefits from surplus hydroelectric wholesale sales is reduced 
the price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand  such as occurs with temperature extremes 
we may need to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods 
the price of natural gas as fuel for natural gas fired electric generation also tends to increase during periods of high demand which are often related to temperature extremes 
we may need to purchase natural gas fuel in these periods of high prices to meet electric demands 
the cost of power supply during peak usage periods may be higher than the retail sales price or the amount allowed in retail rates by our regulators 
to the extent that power supply costs are above the amount allowed currently in retail rates  the difference is partially absorbed by the company in current expense and it is partially deferred or shared with customers through regulatory mechanisms 
therefore  the impact on our results of operations may be larger or smaller than the weather related impact on power supply cost 
as a result of these factors operating in combination  our net cost of power supply the difference between our costs of generation and market purchases  reduced by our revenue from wholesale sales varies significantly because of weather 
we have significant capital requirements that we expect to fund  in part  by accessing capital markets 
financial market conditions may impact our results of operations and our liquidity 
deterioration in the financial markets and credit availability and the state of the global  united states and regional economies could have an impact on our operations 
we could experience increased borrowing costs or limited access to capital on reasonable terms 
additionally  we may experience an increase in uncollectible customer 
table of contents avista corporation accounts and collection times 
the consequences of a prolonged recession may include a lower level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy prices 
a lower level of economic activity might result in a decline in energy consumption  which may adversely affect our revenues and future growth 
the deterioration in the financial markets could also result in significant declines in the market values of assets held by our pension plan which impacts the funded status of the plan and could increase future funding obligations and pension expense 
we rely on access to credit from financial institutions for short term borrowings 
we need to maintain access to adequate levels of credit with financial institutions for short term liquidity 
we have million and million committed lines of credit  which are scheduled to expire in april we cannot predict whether we will have access to credit beyond the expiration date 
the line of credit agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions 
in the event of default  it would be difficult for us to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
we are dependent on our ability to access long term capital markets 
we need to access long term capital markets to finance capital expenditures  repay maturing long term debt and obtain additional working capital from time to time 
our ability to access capital on reasonable terms is subject to numerous factors and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to obtain capital on reasonable terms  it may limit or prohibit our ability to finance capital expenditures and repay maturing long term debt 
our liquidity needs could exceed our short term credit availability and lead to defaults on various financing arrangements 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
we are subject to commodity price risk 
a combination of factors exposes our operations to commodity price risks 
these factors include our obligation to serve our retail customers at rates set through the regulatory process 
we cannot change retail rates to reflect current energy prices unless and until we receive regulatory approval 
customer demand  which is beyond our control because of weather  customer choices  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
some of our energy supply cost is fixed by nature of the energy producing assets or through contractual arrangements 
however  a significant portion of our energy resource costs are not fixed 
because we must supply the amount of energy demanded by our customers and we must sell it at fixed rates and only a portion of our energy supply costs are fixed  we are subject to the risk of higher prices in wholesale energy markets 
electricity and natural gas in wholesale markets are commodities with historically high price volatility 
changes in wholesale energy prices affect  among other things  the cash requirements to purchase electricity and natural gas for retail customers or wholesale obligations and the market value of derivative assets and liabilities 
even when we enter into fixed price energy commodity transactions for future delivery  we are subject to credit terms that may require us to provide collateral to wholesale counterparties related to the difference between current prices and the agreed upon fixed prices 
these collateral requirements can place significant demands on our cash flows or borrowing arrangements 
price volatility can cause collateral requirements to change quickly and significantly 
regulators may not grant rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of our costs or allow a reasonable rate of return for our shareholders 
we have experienced higher costs for utility operations in each of the last several years 
we have also made significant capital investments into utility plant assets 
our ability to recover these costs depends on the amount and timeliness of retail rate changes allowed by regulatory agencies 
we expect to periodically file for rate increases with regulatory agencies to recover our costs and provide a reasonable return to our shareholders 
if regulators grant substantially lower rate increases than our requests in the future  it could have a negative effect on our operating revenues  net income and cash flows 

table of contents avista corporation deferred power and natural gas costs are subject to regulatory review  costs higher than those recovered in base rates reduce cash flows 
we defer income statement recognition and recovery from customers of certain power and natural gas costs that are higher than what is currently authorized by regulators 
these power and natural gas costs are recorded as deferred charges with the opportunity for future recovery through retail rates 
these deferred costs are subject to review for prudence and for the potential of disallowance by regulators 
despite the opportunity to recover deferred power and natural gas costs  our operating cash flows are negatively affected until these costs are recovered from customers 
our energy resource management activities may cause volatility in our cash flows and results of operations 
we engage in active hedging and resource optimization practices  however  we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our energy resource assets or our forecasted net positions for various time horizons 
to reduce energy cost volatility and economic exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  we routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity and natural gas  as well as forecasted excess or deficit energy positions and inventories of natural gas 
we use physical energy contracts and derivative instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps and options traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
we do not cover the entire market price volatility exposure for our forecasted net positions 
to the extent we have positions that are not hedged  or if hedging positions do not fully match the corresponding purchase or sale  fluctuating commodity prices could have a material effect on our operating revenues  resource costs  derivative assets and liabilities  and operating cash flows 
in addition  actual loads and resources typically vary from forecasts  sometimes to a significant degree  which requires additional transactions or dispatch decisions that impact cash flows 
downgrades in our credit ratings could limit our ability to obtain financing  adversely affect the terms of financing and impact our ability to acquire energy resources 
we restored an overall corporate investment grade credit rating with the three major credit rating agencies 
our credit ratings were downgraded during  which resulted in an overall corporate credit rating that was below investment grade 
the downgrades were due to liquidity concerns primarily related to the significant amount of purchased power and natural gas costs that we incurred in our utility operations 
these downgrades increased our debt service costs 
any future downgrades could limit our ability to access capital markets or obtain other financing on reasonable terms 
future downgrades could also require us to provide letters of credit and or collateral to lenders and counterparties 
in addition  future downgrades could reduce the number of counterparties willing to do business with us 
we are subject to various operational and event risks that are common to the utility industry 
our utility operations are subject to operational and event risks that include blackouts or disruptions to distribution  transmission or transportation systems  forced outages at generating plants  fuel cost and availability  including delivery constraints  disruptions to our information systems and other administrative resources required for normal operations  weather conditions and natural disasters that can cause physical damage to property  requiring repairs to restore utility service  and terrorism and other malicious threats 
we are currently the subject of several regulatory proceedings  and we are named in multiple lawsuits related to our participation in western energy markets as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
through our utility operations and the prior operations of avista energy  we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and complaints related to energy markets in the western united states 
most of these proceedings and complaints relate to the significant increase in the spot market price of energy in and this allegedly contributed to or caused unjust and unreasonable prices 
these proceedings and complaints include  but are not limited to refund proceedings in california and the pacific northwest  market conduct investigations by the ferc  and complaints filed by various parties related to alleged misconduct by parties in western power markets 

table of contents avista corporation as a result of these proceedings and complaints  certain parties have asserted claims for significant refunds and damages from us  which could result in a negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
any potential refunds or obligations arising from western energy market issues or any other contingent matters were retained by avista energy as part of its asset sale agreement in june we are subject to legislation and related administrative rulemaking  including periodic audits of compliance with such rules  which may adversely affect our operational and financial performance 
we expect to continue to be affected by legislation at the national  state and local level  as well as by administrative rules and requirements published by government agencies  including the ferc and the epa 
we are also subject to nerc and wecc reliability standards 
the ferc  the nerc and the wecc may perform periodic audits of the company 
failure to comply with the ferc  the nerc  or the wecc requirements can result in financial penalties of up to million per day per violation 
future legislation or administrative rules could have a material adverse effect on our operations  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
there has been increasing legislative action related to concerns over long term global climate changes  which may affect our operational and financial performance 
we are subject to legislative developments at both the state and national level for the potential of further restrictions on sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide  carbon dioxide  as well as other greenhouse gas and mercury emissions 
our operations could be affected by changes in laws and regulations intended to mitigate the risk of global climate changes  including restrictions on the operation of our power generation resources 
in particular  a greenhouse gas bill was passed by the legislature in the state of washington and a bill was approved by the us house of representatives 
there will most likely be continuing activity in the near future 
environmental laws and regulations may increase the operating costs of generating plants  increase the lead time and capital costs for the construction of new generating plants  require modification of our existing generating plants  require existing generating plant operations to be curtailed or shut down  reduce the amount of energy available from our generating plants  and restrict the types of generating plants that can be built 
we have contingent liabilities  including certain matters related to potential environmental liabilities  and cannot predict the outcome of these matters 
in the normal course of our business  we have matters that are the subject of ongoing litigation  mediation  investigation and or negotiation 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome or potential impact of any particular issue  including the extent  if any  of insurance coverage or that amounts payable by us may be recoverable through the ratemaking process 
we are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities related to our past  present and future operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of these matters including a potential liability related to contamination from the holding ponds at colstrip in montana  waste oil delivered to the harbor oil  inc site in portland  oregon  and aluminum dross located on a parcel of land we own near the spokane river

business segments we have two reportable business segments as follows avista utilities an operating division of avista corp 
that comprises our regulated utility operations 
avista utilities generates  transmits and distributes electricity and distributes natural gas 
the utility also engages in wholesale purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas 

table of contents avista corporation advantage iq an indirect subsidiary of avista corp 
approximately percent owned as of december  that provides sustainable utility expense management solutions to its customers that are generally multi site companies across north america to assess and manage utility costs and usage 
advantage iq s primary product lines include processing  payment and auditing of energy  telecom  waste  water sewer and lease bills  as well as strategic management services 
we have other businesses  including sheet metal fabrication  venture fund investments and real estate investments  as well as certain natural gas storage facilities held by avista energy 
these activities do not represent a reportable business segment and are conducted by various indirect subsidiaries of avista corp  including advanced manufacturing and development am d  doing business as metalfx 
the following table presents net income loss attributable to avista corporation for each of our business segments and the other businesses for the year ended december dollars in thousands avista utilities advantage iq other net income attributable to avista corporation executive level summary overall our operating results and cash flows are primarily from regulated utility operations avista utilities  and facility information and cost management services for multi site customers advantage iq 
our net income attributable to avista corporation was million for  an increase from million for this increase was primarily due to increased earnings at avista utilities primarily due to the implementation of general rate increases in washington and idaho as well as a decrease in interest expense 
this was partially offset by a decrease in earnings at advantage iq and an increase in the net loss from the other businesses 
in late  early  and early  moody s investors service  standard poor s and fitch ratings  inc upgraded our credit ratings  which resulted in an investment grade rating for our senior unsecured debt and corporate rating from each of these rating agencies 
the upgrades reflected several steps taken over the past few years to lower our business risk profile and improve financial metrics 
see further discussion at credit ratings 
it is important to note that we are at the lower end of the investment grade category 
we are working to continuously strengthen our credit ratings by improving earnings and operating cash flows  controlling costs and reducing our debt ratio 
employment has declined throughout our service area due to cutbacks in the construction  forest products  mining and manufacturing sectors 
non farm employment contraction for december as compared to december was percent in spokane  washington  percent in medford  oregon and percent in coeur d alene  idaho  compared to the national average decline of percent 
unemployment rates were higher for december than december in our service areas 
unemployment rates for december were percent in spokane  washington  percent in coeur d alene  idaho and percent in medford  oregon  compared to the national average of percent 
the housing markets in coeur d alene  idaho and medford  oregon have had a higher foreclosure rate than the national average  the annual foreclosure rate was percent in kootenai county the county that includes coeur d alene  idaho  and percent in jackson county the county that includes medford  oregon compared to the national foreclosure rate of percent  the housing market in spokane county remains stable with a foreclosure rate of percent 
avista utilities avista utilities is our most significant business segment 
our utility operating and financial performance is dependent upon  among other things weather conditions  regulatory decisions  allowing our utility to recover costs  including purchased power and fuel costs  on a timely basis  and to earn a fair return on investment  the price of natural gas in the wholesale market  including the effect on the price of fuel for generation  the price of electricity in the wholesale market  including the effects of weather conditions  natural gas prices and other factors affecting supply and demand  and 
table of contents avista corporation the ability to obtain financing through the issuance of debt and or equity securities  which can be affected by various factors including our credit ratings  interest rates and other capital market conditions 
our utility net income was million for  an increase from million for partially due to an increase in gross margin operating revenues less resource costs 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the implementation of the general rate increases in washington and idaho 
in addition  our power supply costs were less than the amount included in retail rates in washington 
this was due to lower wholesale electric and natural gas fuel prices  partially offset by below normal hydroelectric generation and the negative impact from the extended outage at the colstrip plant with one of the units out of service from may until november 
this resulted in a benefit of million under the energy recovery mechanism erm in washington for compared to an expense of million in the increase in net income was also due to a decrease in interest expense 
these positive impacts on net income were partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income taxes 
we are continuing to invest in generation  transmission and distribution systems to enhance service reliability for our customers 
utility capital expenditures were million for we expect utility capital expenditures to be over million for these estimates of capital expenditures are subject to continuing review and adjustment and do not include costs for projects associated with stimulus funding see discussion at avista utilities capital expenditures 
advantage iq advantage iq had net income of million for  a decrease from million for the decrease for as compared to was primarily due to lower short term interest rates which decreases interest revenue  the decrease in our ownership percentage in the business in connection with the acquisition of cadence network effective july  and increased amortization of intangible assets related to the cadence and ecos acquisitions refer to the cadence and ecos discussions below 
during  we experienced slower internal growth at advantage iq than was originally expected  as some of its clients are experiencing bankruptcies and store closures in these difficult economic times 
additionally  interest revenue was lower in due to the historic low short term interest rate environment that we are experiencing  which is expected to continue in the decrease in interest revenue was offset by other customer billing services  which increased operating revenues for as compared to on august   advantage iq acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of ecos consulting  inc ecos  a portland  oregon based energy efficiency solutions provider 
the acquisition of ecos was funded primarily through borrowings under advantage iq s committed credit agreement 
under the terms of the transaction  the assets and liabilities of ecos were acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of advantage iq 
effective july   advantage iq acquired cadence network  a cincinnati  ohio based energy and expense management company 
as consideration  the owners of cadence network received a percent ownership interest in advantage iq 
the acquisition of cadence network was funded with the issuance of advantage iq common stock  which is subject to redemption 
under the transaction agreement  the previous owners of cadence network can exercise a right to have their shares of advantage iq stock redeemed during july or july if advantage iq is not liquidated through either an initial public offering or sale of the business to a third party 
their redemption rights expire july  the redemption price would be determined based on the fair market value of advantage iq at the time of the redemption election as determined by certain independent parties 
we would like to have a market determined valuation of our investment in advantage iq within the next four years 
the potential valuation of advantage iq depends on future market conditions  growth of the business and other factors 
this may provide access to public market capital and provide potential liquidity to avista corp 
and the other owners of advantage iq

on january   the public counsel section of the washington attorney general s office public counsel filed a petition for judicial review in thurston county superior court of the wutc s december order approving our multiparty settlement 
public counsel raised a number of issues that were previously argued before the wutc 
these included whether the recovery of settlement costs associated with resolving a dispute with the coeur d alene tribe would constitute illegal retroactive ratemaking the washington portion of these costs was million 
public counsel also questioned whether the wutc s decision to entertain supplemental testimony to update our filing for power supply costs during the course of the proceedings was appropriate 
finally  public counsel argued that the settlement improperly included advertising costs  dues and donations  and certain other expenses 
the appeal itself did not prevent the new rates from going into effect 
on december   the thurston county superior court affirmed the decision of the wutc and rejected the arguments of public counsel  with the exception of disallowing million of miscellaneous expenses  including charitable donations 
public counsel has until march  to further appeal the wutc s decision

the new electric and natural gas rates became effective on january  following the execution of a partial settlement stipulation in september  we revised our electric rate increase request downward from million to million  primarily due to the decline in the wholesale prices of electricity and natural gas 
we also reduced our natural gas request from million to million 
under the partial settlement stipulation  we reached agreement with the other settling parties on issues in the areas of cost of capital  power supply  rate spread and rate design  and funding under the low income ratepayer assistance program 
the wutc approved this partial settlement stipulation in its order on december  the wutc did not allow us to include the costs associated with the power purchase agreement for the lancaster plant in rates  indicating we did not demonstrate compliance with certain requirements necessary for immediate inclusion in rates 
however  the wutc directed us to file to defer costs associated with the lancaster plant  with a carrying charge  for potential recovery in a future rate proceeding if we demonstrate that we have satisfied these requirements 
our proposed deferred accounting treatment for the net costs associated with the lancaster plant was 
table of contents avista corporation approved by the wutc in february the net costs associated with the power purchase agreement for the lancaster plant account for approximately half of the difference between our revised electric rate increase request of million and the million increase approved by the wutc 
the wutc also did not allow for certain pro forma future capital additions to rate base  as well as certain increases in labor costs  tree trimming costs and information systems costs 
these costs account for the majority of the remaining difference between our revised electric rate increase request and the amount approved by the wutc 
the partial settlement stipulation as approved by the wutc on december  is based on an overall rate of return of percent with a common equity ratio of percent and a percent return on equity 
our original request was based on a proposed overall rate of return of percent with a common equity ratio of percent and an percent return on equity 
idaho general rate cases in august  we entered into an all party settlement stipulation in our electric and natural gas general rate cases that were filed with the ipuc in april this settlement stipulation was approved by the ipuc in september the new electric and natural gas rates became effective on october  as agreed to in the settlement  base electric rates for our idaho customers increased by an average of percent  which was designed to increase annual revenues by million

total net deferred natural gas costs were a liability of million as of december   an increase from million as of december  the liability at december  is being refunded to customers through the pgas implemented in november 
table of contents avista corporation oregon senate bill the opuc established rules in september related to oregon senate bill osb  which was enacted into law in these rules direct the utility to establish an automatic adjustment clause to account for the difference between income taxes collected in rates and taxes paid to units of government  net of adjustments  when that difference exceeds  the automatic adjustment clause may result in either rate increases or rate decreases 
in october  the opuc approved a settlement stipulation in our general rate case that also resolved the refund liability for the tax report 
the approved settlement provided for a refund of million  including interest  over a two month period  november and december of this refund was approximately equal to the new revenue from the general rate increase for this period 
in october  we filed the tax report for showing taxes paid to be less than taxes collected by million before interest 
in january  we filed an all party settlement with the opuc for this amount 
we expect an order from the opuc on the final level of refund by april we recorded a potential refund liability for the tax report of million 
natural gas decoupling in january  the wutc approved the implementation of a natural gas decoupling mechanism as a pilot for a two and one half year period 
the decoupling mechanism is designed to recover a portion of lost margin resulting from lower usage by washington residential and small commercial customers primarily due to conservation 
however  the mechanism does not provide rate adjustments related to abnormal weather 
as part of the general rate case order in december  the wutc approved continuation of the natural gas decoupling mechanism on a permanent basis  with certain modifications 
beginning july  we can defer percent of the lost margin associated with lower customer usage  as compared to a deferral of percent during the pilot period 
in the fall of each year  we can file to recover the deferred amount accumulated over the most recent july june period if our energy efficiency therm savings meet certain pre established targets associated with our natural gas demand side management programs 
if per customer therm usage weather normalized during a july june period were to increase instead of decrease  it may result in a refund to customers of percent of the margin associated with higher customer usage 
power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms the erm is an accounting method used to track certain differences between actual power supply costs  net of the margin on wholesale sales  and the amount included in base retail rates for our washington customers 
in periods where we are a net seller of wholesale power  market prices lower than the prices included in rates negatively impact the erm 
in periods where we are a net purchaser  market prices lower than the amount included in retail rates have a beneficial impact under the erm 
this difference in net power supply costs primarily results from changes in short term wholesale market prices and sales and purchase volumes  the level of hydroelectric generation  the level of thermal generation including changes in fuel prices  and retail loads 
we absorb the cost or receive the benefit from the initial amount of power supply costs in excess of or below the level in retail rates  which is referred to as the deadband 
the annual calendar year deadband amount is currently million 
we incur the cost of  or receive the benefit from  percent of this initial power supply cost variance 
we share annual power supply cost variances between million and million with customers 
there is a percent customers percent company sharing when actual power supply expenses are higher surcharge to customers than the amount included in base retail rates within this band 
there is a percent customers percent company sharing when actual power supply expenses are lower rebate to customers than the amount included in base retail rates within this band 
to the extent that the annual power supply cost variance from the amount included in base rates exceeds million  percent of the cost variance is deferred for future surcharge or rebate 
we absorb into power supply costs the remaining percent of the annual variance beyond million 
the following is a summary of the erm annual power supply cost variability deferred for future surcharge or rebate to customers expense or benefit to the company million between million million between million million excess over million 
table of contents avista corporation under the erm  we make an annual filing on or before april of each year to provide the opportunity for the wutc staff and other interested parties to review the prudence of and audit the erm deferred power cost transactions for the prior calendar year 
the erm provides for a day review period for the filing  however  the period may be extended by agreement of the parties or by wutc order 
additionally  we must make a filing no sooner than january   to allow all interested parties the opportunity to review the erm  and make recommendations to the wutc related to the continuation  modification or elimination of the erm 
in february  the wutc approved our request to eliminate the existing erm surcharge 
the surcharge was eliminated as the previous balance of deferred power costs has been substantially recovered 
this will result in an overall rate reduction of percent for our washington customers with no impact on our income from operations or net income 
a provision of our erm requires that in the case of a major plant outage below percent availability  there may be a disallowance of fixed costs during the outage period if the outage resulted from imprudent actions  or if actual fixed costs are below the level used to calculate base rates 
during scheduled maintenance in march  turbines in unit of colstrip  of which we are a percent owner  were found to be in need of repair 
these repairs extended the planned outage from may until november we believe the outage was not due to imprudent actions and we expect there will not be a reduction in fixed costs for the plant outage 
we have a power cost adjustment pca mechanism in idaho that allows us to modify electric rates on october of each year with ipuc approval 
under the pca mechanism  we defer percent of the difference between certain actual net power supply expenses and the amount included in base retail rates for our idaho customers 
the october rate adjustments recover or rebate power costs deferred during the preceding july june twelve month period 
the pca rate surcharge was cents per kwh for the period october  through september  however  the surcharge rate was lowered to cents per kwh on august  to help mitigate the impact of the general rate increase that was also effective on that date 
the surcharge rate is expected to remain in place until october   when it will be replaced by a new rate that will be proposed as part of the pca report for the period july  through june  the following table shows activity in deferred power costs for washington and idaho during and dollars in thousands washington idaho total deferred power costs as of december  activity from january december  power costs deferred interest and other net additions recovery of deferred power costs through retail rates deferred power costs as of december  activity from january december  power costs deferred interest and other net additions recovery of deferred power costs through retail rates deferred power costs as of december  results of operations the following provides an overview of changes in our consolidated statements of income

this represents fuel that was purchased for generation  but was later sold when conditions indicated that it was not economic to use the fuel in generation as part of the resource optimization process 
the associated revenues are reflected as sales of fuel 
other fuel costs were less than the revenues we received from selling the natural gas 
we account for this difference under the erm in washington and the pca in idaho 
the increase in other fuel costs was primarily due to increased thermal generation resource optimization activities and increased fuel prices 
other regulatory amortizations increased million primarily due to amortization of demand side management program expenses 
the expense for natural gas purchased increased million due to an increase in total therms purchased and the price of natural gas 
the increase in total therms purchased was due to an increase in wholesale sales as part of the balancing of loads and resources as part of the natural gas procurement process and an increase in retail sales volumes 
we engage in optimization of under utilized interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity through wholesale purchases and sales of natural gas

the increase in operating revenues and expenses was primarily due to the third quarter acquisition of cadence network and the third quarter acquisition of ecos  as well as increased revenues from other customer billing services 
these increases in operating revenues were partially offset by a decrease in interest revenue on funds held for customers due to a decrease in interest rates 
the increase in operating expenses was also due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisitions

for information on accounting standards adopted in and earlier periods  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
accounting standards codification asc 
this statement amends certain provisions of sfas no 
asc related to accounting for transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
we are required to adopt this statement effective january  we are evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in particular  we are evaluating our accounts receivable sales to determine whether or not the transactions meet the criteria of sales of financial assets 
if the transactions did not meet the criteria  the transactions would be accounted for as secured borrowings 
as of december   we had not sold any accounts receivable under the revolving agreement

the amendments will significantly affect the overall consolidation analysis of variable interest entities vie 
the amendments will require us to reconsider previous conclusions relating to the consolidation of vies  including whether an entity is a vie  whether we are the vie s primary beneficiary  and what type of financial statement disclosures are required 
we are required to adopt this statement effective january  we are evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in particular  we are evaluating the potential consolidation of spokane energy llc see disclosure at spokane energy llc 
this would add approximately million of assets and liabilities consisting primarily of a long term contract receivable and non recourse debt to the consolidated balance sheet  with no material effect on our results of operations 
in addition  we are evaluating certain long term power purchase contracts under this guidance 
we will finalize our evaluation during the first quarter of to determine the impact of adoption  if any  on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and thus actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
the following accounting policies represent those that our management believes are particularly important to the consolidated financial statements that require the use of estimates and assumptions avista utilities operating revenues operating revenues for our utility related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to our customers 
the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  we estimate the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated and recorded 

table of contents avista corporation our estimate of unbilled revenue is based on the number of customers  current rates  meter reading dates  actual native load for electricity  and actual throughput for natural gas 
any difference between actual and estimated revenue is automatically corrected in the following month when the actual meter reading and customer billing occurs 
regulatory accounting we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation asc for our regulated utility operations 
asc requires that certain costs and or obligations such as incurred power and natural gas costs not currently recovered through rates  but expected to be recovered in the future be reflected as deferred charges on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in our consolidated statements of income until the period during which matching revenues are recognized 
we expect to recover our regulatory assets through future rates 
our regulatory assets are subject to review for prudence and recoverability 
as such  certain deferred costs may be disallowed by our regulators 
if at some point in the future we determine that we no longer meet the criteria for continued application of asc for all or a portion of our regulated operations  we could be required to write off regulatory assets  and precluded from the future deferral of costs not recovered through rates when such costs are incurred  even if we expect to recover such costs in the future 
utility energy commodity derivative assets and liabilities our utility enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of energy at a specified time  or during a specified period  in the future 
these contracts are entered into as part of our management of loads and resources and certain contracts are considered derivative instruments 
the wutc and the ipuc issued accounting orders authorizing us to offset commodity derivative assets or liabilities with a regulatory asset or liability 
this accounting treatment is intended to defer the recognition of mark to market gains and losses on energy commodity transactions until the period of settlement 
the orders provide for us to not recognize the unrealized gain or loss on utility derivative commodity instruments in the consolidated statements of income 
realized gains or losses are recognized in the period of settlement  subject to approval for recovery through retail rates 
realized gains and losses  subject to regulatory approval  result in adjustments to retail rates through purchased gas cost adjustments  the erm in washington  the pca mechanism in idaho  and periodic general rates cases 
we use quoted market prices and forward price curves to estimate the fair value of our utility derivative commodity instruments 
as such  the fair value of utility derivative commodity instruments recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis 
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans we have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all regular full time employees at avista utilities 
our finance committee of the board of directors establishes investment policies  objectives and strategies that seek an appropriate return for the pension plan  and reviews and approves changes to the investment and funding policies 
we have contracted with an investment consultant who is responsible for managing monitoring the individual investment managers 
the investment managers performance and related individual fund performance is reviewed at least quarterly by an internal benefits committee and by the finance committee to monitor compliance with our established investment policy objectives and strategies 
our pension plan assets are invested primarily in marketable debt and equity securities 
pension plan assets may also be invested in real estate  absolute return  venture capital private equity and commodity funds 
in seeking to obtain the desired return to fund the pension plan  the investment consultant recommends allocation percentages by asset classes 
these recommendations are reviewed by the internal benefits committee  which then recommends their adoption by the finance committee 
the finance committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also have a supplemental executive retirement plan serp that provides additional pension benefits to our executive officers whose benefits under the pension plan are reduced due to the application of section of the internal revenue code of and the deferral of salary under deferred compensation plans 

table of contents avista corporation pension costs including the serp were million for  million for and million for of our pension costs  approximately percent are expensed and percent are capitalized consistent with labor charges 
the costs related to the serp are expensed 
our costs for the pension plan are determined in part by actuarial formulas that are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs are affected by employee demographics including age  compensation and length of service by employees  the amount of cash contributions we make to the pension plan  and the return on pension plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of our pension plan may also affect current and future pension costs 
pension plan costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on pension plan assets  discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs  and assumed rate of increase in employee compensation 
the change in pension plan obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in our consolidated statement of income  but we generally recognize the change in future years over the remaining average service period of pension plan participants 
as such  our costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to pension plan participants 
in  the company reviewed the mortality table utilized in the actuarial calculations 
the company determined that the rp combined healthy mortality tables for males and females should be replaced with the rp combined healthy mortality tables for males and females projected to using scale aa 
the change resulted in an increase of million to the pension benefit obligation as of december  in  the rates at which participants are assumed to retire by age were analyzed based upon historical trends and future projections 
we revised the rates to assume that a greater percentage of participants would retire between the ages of and the assumed rates were revised to range from percent to percent and percent at age the previous rates ranged from percent to percent and percent at age the change resulted in an increase of million to the pension benefit obligation as of december  the changes will also increase future years pension costs 
we have not made any changes to pension plan provisions in  and that have had any significant effect on our recorded pension plan amounts 
we have revised the key assumption of the discount rate in  and such changes had an effect on our pension costs in  and and may affect future years  given the cost recognition approach described above 
however  in determining pension obligation and cost amounts  our assumptions can change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to our future pension costs and funding requirements 
in selecting a discount rate  we consider yield rates for highly rated corporate bond portfolios with maturities similar to that of the expected term of pension benefits 
we increased the pension plan discount rate from percent in to percent in in we used the percent rate for estimating our benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by our plan 
the expected long term rate of return was percent in each of  and the actual return on plan assets  net of fees  was a gain of million or percent for  a loss of million or percent for and a gain of million or percent for we periodically analyze the estimated long term rate of return on assets based upon revisions to the investment portfolio 
effective january   we decreased the expected long term rate of return on plan assets from percent to percent 
this will increase pension cost in by approximately million 
of our pension costs  approximately percent are expensed and percent are capitalized consistent with labor charges 

table of contents avista corporation the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage dollars in thousands actuarial assumption change in assumption effect on projected benefit obligation effect on pension cost expected long term return on plan assets expected long term return on plan assets discount rate discount rate changes in the expected return on plan assets would not have an effect on our total pension liability 
we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all of our retired employees 
we accrue the estimated cost of postretirement benefit obligations during the years that employees provide service 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our postretirement plans 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by million and the service and interest cost by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by million and the service and interest cost by million 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions in our consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the fair value of each performance share award was estimated on the date of grant using a statistical model that incorporates the probability of meeting performance targets based on historical returns relative to a peer group 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a three year period 
the expected term of the performance shares is three years based on the performance cycle 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield at the time of grant 
contingencies we have unresolved regulatory  legal and tax issues for which there is inherent uncertainty for the ultimate outcome of the respective matter 
we accrue a loss contingency if it is probable that an asset is impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss or impairment can be reasonably estimated 
we also disclose losses that do not meet these conditions for accrual  if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
for all material contingencies  we have made a judgment as to the probability of a loss occurring and as to whether or not the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss recognition criteria are met  liabilities are accrued or assets are reduced 
however  no assurance can be given for the ultimate outcome of any particular contingency 

table of contents avista corporation liquidity and capital resources review of cash flow statement overall during  positive cash flows from operating activities of million and proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million were used to fund the majority of our cash requirements

debt maturities were million and cash paid to settle interest rate swaps was million in additionally  customer funds obligations at advantage iq decreased by million 
overall liquidity our consolidated operating cash flows are primarily derived from the operations of avista utilities 
the primary source of operating cash flows for our utility operations is revenues from sales of electricity and natural gas 

table of contents avista corporation significant uses of cash flows from our utility operations include the purchase of electricity and natural gas  and payment of other operating expenses  taxes and interest  with any excess being available for other corporate uses such as capital expenditures and dividends 
we design operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and optimize capital expenditures  particularly for our regulated utility operations 
in addition to operating expenses  we have continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of utility facilities 
over time  our operating cash flows usually do not fully support the amount required for utility capital expenditures 
as such  from time to time  we need to access capital markets in order to fund these needs as well as fund maturing debt 
see further discussion at capital resources 
we periodically file for rate adjustments for recovery of operating costs and capital investments to provide the opportunity to align our earned returns with those allowed by regulators 
effective january   the wutc authorized an increase in our rates in washington designed to increase annual electric revenues by million and annual natural gas revenues by million 
effective august   the ipuc authorized an increase in our electric rates in idaho designed to increase annual electric revenues by million 
offsetting the electric revenue increase was an overall decrease in the current pca surcharge  which is designed to decrease annual electric revenues by million 
effective august   the ipuc authorized an increase in our natural gas rates in idaho designed to increase annual revenues by million 
offsetting the natural gas rate increase was an overall pga decrease resulting in a million decrease in annual revenues 
effective january   the wutc authorized an increase in our rates in washington designed to increase annual electric revenues by million and annual natural gas revenues by million 
in addition  pga decreases were implemented in all of our jurisdictions and a general rate increase was implemented in oregon effective november  see further details in the section avista utilities regulatory matters 
for our utility operations  when power and natural gas costs exceed the levels currently recovered from retail customers  net cash flows are negatively affected 
factors that could cause purchased power costs to exceed the levels currently recovered from our customers include  but are not limited to  higher prices in wholesale markets when we buy energy or an increased need to purchase power in the wholesale markets 
factors beyond our control that could result in an increased need to purchase power in the wholesale markets include  but are not limited to increases in demand either due to weather or customer growth  low availability of streamflows for hydroelectric generation  unplanned outages at generating facilities  and failure of third parties to deliver on energy or capacity contracts 
we monitor the potential liquidity impacts of increasing energy commodity prices and other increased operating costs for our utility operations 
we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet the increased cash needs of higher energy commodity prices and other increased operating costs through our million committed line of credit which expires in april  million committed line of credit which expires in april  and million revolving accounts receivable sales facility which expires in march 
as of december   we had a combined million of available liquidity under the three facilities described above 
our utility has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of power and natural gas supply costs 
however  if prices rise above the level currently allowed in retail rates in periods when we are buying energy  deferral balances will increase  which will negatively affect our cash flow and liquidity until such costs  with interest  are recovered from customers 
credit and nonperformance risk our contracts for the purchase and sale of energy commodities often require collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit or other credit enhancements  or reductions or terminations of a portion of the contract through cash settlement in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse changes in market prices 
for example  in addition to limiting our ability to conduct transactions  if our credit ratings were lowered to below investment grade and energy prices decreased by percent in the first year and percent in subsequent years  we estimate  based on our positions outstanding at december   that we would potentially be required to post additional collateral up to million 
the additional collateral amount is higher than the amount disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements because this analysis includes contracts that are not considered derivatives and due to the assumptions about potential energy price changes 

table of contents avista corporation under the terms of interest rate swap agreements that we enter into periodically  we may be required to post cash collateral depending on fluctuations in the fair value of the instrument 
this has not historically been significant to our liquidity position 
as of december   we did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
our utility held cash deposits from other parties in the amount of million as of december  and million as of december  these amounts are subject to return if conditions warrant because of continuing portfolio value fluctuations with those parties or substitution of collateral 
in december  the us house of representatives passed the wall street reform and consumer protection act of the house bill which would establish regulatory jurisdiction by the commodity futures trading commission cftc for certain swaps which includes a variety of derivative instruments and the users of such swaps 
under the house bill  major swap participants would be required to register with the cftc and  among other things  maintain minimum capital and margin requirements 
major swap participants would include entities with large swap positions  excluding swaps held primarily for hedging commercial risk 
since we use derivative instruments primarily for hedging commercial risks  it is unlikely that we would be subject to the proposed cftc regulation 
the house bill would also require a broad category of swaps to be cleared and traded on registered exchanges or special derivatives exchanges 
such clearing requirements could impose a significant change from our current practices of bilateral transactions and negotiated credit terms 
clearing requirements could involve greater liquidity as collateral 
however  there would be an exemption  available on an individual basis  for an end user that is not a major swap participant  and we believe we would qualify for such an exemption 
although the house bill may not have a material direct adverse effect on us  concern remains that our counterparties who are not exempt would pass along increased costs and margin requirements through higher prices and reductions in unsecured credit limits 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any final legislation affecting derivatives  if enacted  would retain the exemptions contained in the house bill 
capital resources our consolidated capital structure  including the current portion of long term debt and short term borrowings  and excluding noncontrolling interests  consisted of the following as of december  and dollars in thousands december  december  amount percent of total amount percent of total current portion of long term debt short term borrowings long term debt to affiliated trusts long term debt total debt total avista corporation stockholders equity total in september  we issued million of percent first mortgage bonds due in the net proceeds from the issuance of million net of discounts and before avista corp 
s expenses were used to retire variable rate short term borrowings outstanding under our million committed line of credit  and for general corporate purposes 
on april   we redeemed the total amount outstanding million of our percent junior subordinated debt securities held by ava capital trust iii long term debt to affiliated trusts 
concurrently  ava capital trust iii redeemed all of the preferred trust securities issued to third parties million and all of the common trust securities issued to us million 
the net redemption of million was funded by borrowings under our million committed line of credit agreement 
we need to finance capital expenditures and obtain additional working capital from time to time 
the cash requirements needed to service our indebtedness  both short term and long term  reduces the amount of cash flow available to fund capital expenditures  working capital  purchased power and natural gas costs  dividends and other requirements 
our stockholders equity increased million during primarily due to net income  partially offset by dividends 
we generally fund capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated cash and external financing 
the level of cash generated internally and the amount that is available for capital expenditures fluctuates depending on a variety of factors 
cash provided by our utility operating activities is expected to be the primary source of funds for 
table of contents avista corporation operating needs  dividends and capital expenditures for borrowings under our million committed line of credit  million committed line of credit and sales of accounts receivable under our million revolving facility will supplement these funds to the extent necessary 
we have million of scheduled long term debt maturities in in december  we purchased million of our pollution control bonds 
we are planning  subject to market conditions  to refund these bonds in along with million of our pollution control bonds we purchased in december we are planning to issue up to million of common stock in in order to maintain our capital structure at an appropriate level for our business 
we have a committed line of credit in the total amount of million with an expiration date of april under the credit agreement  we can borrow or request the issuance of letters of credit in any combination up to million 
as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this committed line of credit  a decrease from million in borrowings outstanding as of december  as of december   there were million in letters of credit outstanding  an increase from million as of december  the committed line of credit is secured by million of non transferable first mortgage bonds issued to the agent bank 
such first mortgage bonds would only become due and payable in the event  and then only to the extent  that we default on obligations under the committed line of credit 
additionally  in november  we entered into a new committed line of credit in the total amount of million with an expiration date of april the new committed line of credit replaced a million committed line of credit that expired in november we reduced the facility based on our forecasted liquidity needs 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under this committed line of credit 
the committed line of credit is secured by million of non transferable first mortgage bonds issued to the agent bank 
such first mortgage bonds would only become due and payable in the event  and then only to the extent  that we default on obligations under the committed line of credit 
our committed line of credit agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions  including a covenant requiring the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense of avista utilities for the preceding twelve month period at the end of any fiscal quarter to be greater than to as of december   we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of to the committed line of credit agreements also have a covenant which does not permit our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization to be greater than percent at any time 
as of december   we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of percent 
any default on the line of credit or other financing arrangements of avista corp 
or any of our significant subsidiaries could result in cross defaults to other agreements of such entity  and or to the line of credit or other financing arrangements of any other of such entities 
any defaults could also induce vendors and other counterparties to demand collateral 
in the event of any such default  it would be difficult for us to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
we do not guarantee the indebtedness of any of our subsidiaries 
as of december   avista corp 
and our subsidiaries were in compliance with all of the covenants of our financing agreements 
we are restricted under our restated articles of incorporation as to the additional preferred stock we can issue 
as of december   we could issue million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of percent 
we are not planning to issue preferred stock 
under the mortgage and deed of trust securing our first mortgage bonds including secured medium term notes  we may issue additional first mortgage bonds in an aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of percent of the cost or fair value whichever is lower of property additions which have not previously been made the basis of any application under the mortgage  or an equal principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds which have not previously been made the basis of any application under the mortgage  or deposit of cash 
provided  however  that we may not issue any additional first mortgage bonds with certain exceptions in the case of bonds issued on the basis of retired bonds unless our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any period of consecutive calendar months out of the preceding calendar months were at least twice the annual interest requirements on all mortgage securities at the time outstanding  including the first mortgage bonds to be issued  and on all indebtedness of prior rank 
as of december   our property additions and retired bonds would have entitled us to issue million in aggregate principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds 
however  using an interest rate of percent on additional first mortgage bonds  and based on net earnings for the months ended december   the net earnings test would limit the principal amount of additional bonds we could issue to million 
we believe that we have adequate capacity to issue first mortgage bonds to meet our financing needs over the next several years 

table of contents avista corporation in december  we entered into an amended and restated sales agency agreement with a sales agent to issue up to million shares of our common stock from time to time 
we originally entered into a sales agency agreement to issue up to million shares of our common stock in december in  we issued  shares of our common stock under this sales agency agreement 
we did not issue any common stock under this agreement in avista utilities capital expenditures capital expenditures for our utility were million for the years through we expect utility capital expenditures to be over million for each of  and in addition to ongoing needs for our distribution system  significant projects include upgrades to generating facilities 
these estimates of capital expenditures are subject to continuing review and adjustment and do not include costs for projects associated with stimulus funding see discussion below 
actual capital expenditures may vary from our estimates due to factors such as changes in business conditions  construction schedules and environmental requirements 
we are committed to investment in generation  transmission and distribution systems with a focus on increasing capacity and maintaining or improving reliability 
we continue to upgrade hydroelectric plants to maintain reliable operations and improve output 
the american recovery and reinvestment act the arra of includes almost billion of stimulus funding in areas that have some relation to electric and natural gas utilities  such as avista corp 
we applied to the smart grid investment grant program under the arra  proposing a percent cost share for the deployment of smart grid enabling technologies in the spokane area 
the total project costs are estimated to be million  which will be spent over a three year period 
in october  we were one of utilities selected to negotiate a grant under this stimulus program 
the grant will be for million and our contribution will be million 
we are working with the department of energy to finalize the grant in early in august  we applied with battelle northwest to participate in a smart grid demonstration project in pullman  washington under the arra 
in november  this project was selected by the department of energy for a grant  which it will negotiate with us and the other partners to reach a funding agreement 
the smart grid demonstration project will partner with other regional utilities and proposes a percent cost share for a group of projects 
our portion of the regional demonstration project is estimated to cost million 
the smart grid demonstration project will spend the funds over the course of five years 
we are subject to washington state renewable energy portfolio standards and must obtain a portion of our electricity from qualifying renewable resources or through purchase of renewable energy credits 
our integrated resource plan irp identified that additional qualifying renewable energy is needed by and that new capacity and energy resources are needed by based on resource acquisition goals identified in the irp  we evaluated proposals from suppliers to provide us with up to average megawatts which equates to approximately mw of wind power of long term qualified renewable energy by the end of in  we completed the acquisition of the development rights for a wind generation site 
we considered developing this site and or acquiring additional renewable resources a few years early by taking advantage of certain federal and state tax incentives 
however  after detailed analysis  we decided to postpone renewable resource acquisitions  including the potential construction of a wind generation project until the timeframe 
future generation resource decisions may be further impacted by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy requirements as discussed at environmental issues and other contingencies 
we are participating in planning activities for the development of a proposed  mw transmission project that would extend from british columbia  canada to northern california 
other participants include pacific gas and electric company and british columbia transmission corporation 
we have executed an agreement stage one agreement with the other participants in order to perform preliminary studies and assessments for the project  including electrical system studies and resource mapping of possible transmission line corridors 
under the stage one agreement  we have committed to contribute million 
the participants are working on a stage two agreement for the project that is expected to be completed in the second quarter of  which  among other things  will determine our financial obligation and participation in the project 
the stakeholders continue to have discussions to explore whether  in light of changing circumstances for other project participants  this project  a different version of this project or another transmission project in the region should be pursued 

table of contents avista corporation advantage iq credit agreement advantage iq has a committed credit agreement with an expiration date of february in july  the committed amount was increased from million to million under the terms of the credit agreement 
advantage iq may elect to increase the credit facility to million under the same agreement 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of advantage iq s assets 
advantage iq had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase in the amount borrowed primarily reflects the funding of the ecos acquisition  partially offset by repayments 
advantage iq operations we do not expect capital expenditures for the years through for advantage iq to be significant to our consolidated cash flows and financial condition 
these capital expenditures are expected to be funded by advantage iq s cash flows from operations 
in  advantage iq amended its employee stock incentive plan to provide an annual window at which time holders of common stock can put their shares back to advantage iq providing the shares are held for a minimum of six months

off balance sheet arrangements avista receivables corporation arc is our wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary formed for the purpose of acquiring or purchasing interests in certain of our accounts receivable  both billed and unbilled 
on march   avista corp  arc and bank of america  na amended a receivables purchase agreement 
the most significant amendment was to extend the termination date from march  to march  the receivables purchase agreement was originally entered into on may  and provides us with cost effective funds for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other general corporate needs 
under the receivables purchase agreement  arc can sell without recourse  on a revolving basis  up to million of our receivables 
arc is obligated to pay fees that approximate the purchaser s cost of issuing commercial paper equal in value to the interests in receivables sold 
the receivables purchase agreement has financial covenants  which are substantially the same as those of our committed line of credit agreements 
as of december   we had the ability to sell up to million of receivables based on calculations of our eligible accounts receivable and there were not any accounts receivable sold under this revolving agreement 
we expect to renew this facility before the march  expiration 
we are evaluating accounts receivable sales under sfas no

rating outlook for standard poor s and moody s was changed to positive from stable in august standard poor s has not assigned a rating to our senior unsecured debt 
we do not have any senior unsecured debt outstanding 
rating outlook on these securities was changed to bb from bbb in january downgrade was a result of a corporate wide change in methodology for fitch  inc related to the rating of preferred trust securities 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
each security rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and  accordingly  each rating should be considered independently of all other ratings 
pension plan as of december   our pension plan had assets with a fair value that was less than the benefit obligation under the plan 
due to market conditions and the decline in the fair value of pension plan assets in  we contributed million to the pension plan in we contributed million to the pension plan in and million in both and in  the fair value of pension plan assets increased 
we expect that our contribution for will be million 
the final determination of pension plan contributions for future periods is subject to multiple variables  most of which are beyond our control  including further changes to the fair value of pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions in particular the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation 
dividends the board of directors considers the level of dividends on our common stock on a regular basis  taking into account numerous factors including  without limitation our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  the success of our business strategies  and general economic and competitive conditions 

table of contents avista corporation our net income available for dividends is primarily derived from our regulated utility operations 
the payment of dividends on common stock is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to preferred stock contained in our restated articles of incorporation  as amended

contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our future contractual obligations as of december  dollars in millions thereafter avista utilities long term debt maturities long term debt to affiliated trusts interest payments on long term debt short term borrowings energy purchase contracts public utility district contracts operating lease obligations other obligations information services contracts pension plan funding avista capital consolidated long term debt short term debt redeemable noncontrolling interests venture funds investments operating lease obligations total contractual obligations represents our estimate of interest payments on long term debt  which is calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity 
interest on variable rate debt is calculated using the rate in effect at december  energy purchase contracts were entered into as part of the obligation to serve our retail electric and natural gas customers energy requirements 
as a result  costs are generally recovered either through base retail rates or adjustments to retail rates as part of the power and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms 
includes the interest component of the lease obligation 
future capital lease obligations are not material

under the transaction agreement  the previous owners of cadence network can exercise a right to have their shares of advantage iq common stock redeemed during july or july if advantage iq is not liquidated through either an initial public offering or sale of the business to a third party 
their redemption rights expire july  the redemption price would be determined based on the fair market value of advantage iq at the time of the redemption election as determined by certain independent parties 
in addition  certain shares acquired under advantage iq s employee stock incentive plan are redeemable at the option of the shareholder 
represents our commitment to fund a limited partnership venture fund commitment made by a subsidiary of avista capital 
these contractual obligations do not include income tax payments 
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  we will incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures in future periods for which we are not contractually obligated as part of our normal business operations 
competition our utility electric and natural gas distribution business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly 
in each regulatory jurisdiction  our rates for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval are determined on a cost of service basis 
rates are designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses and capital investments  an opportunity for us to earn a reasonable return on investment as set by our regulators 

table of contents avista corporation in retail markets  we compete with various rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts in and adjacent to our service territories in the provision of service to new electric customers 
alternate providers of energy may also compete with us for sales to existing customers 
similarly  our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy sources including heating oil  propane and other fuels 
in wholesale markets  competition for available electric supply is influenced by the localized and system wide demand for energy  type  capacity  location and availability of generation resources  and variety and circumstances of market participants 
these wholesale markets are regulated by the ferc  which requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  enlarge or construct additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services  and transparently price and offer transmission services without favor to any party  including the merchant functions of the utility 
participants in the wholesale energy markets include other utilities  federal power marketing agencies  energy marketing and trading companies  independent power producers  financial institutions  and commodity brokers 
we actively monitor and participate  as appropriate in energy industry developments  to maintain and enhance the ability to effectively participate in wholesale energy markets consistent with our business goals 
advantage iq is subject to competition for service to existing customers and as they develop products and services and enter new markets 
competition from other companies may mean challenges for advantage iq to be the first to market a new product or service to gain the advantage in market share 
other challenges for advantage iq include the availability of funding and resources to meet capital needs  and rapidly advancing technologies which requires continual product enhancement to avoid obsolescence 
long term economic and utility load growth based on our forecast for electric customer growth to average to percent and natural gas customer growth to average to percent within our service area  we anticipate retail electric and natural gas load growth will average between and percent annually for the four year period while the number of electric customers is growing  the average annual usage by each residential electric customer has stabilized 
natural gas sales growth has slowed as retail prices have increased relative to historical prices and company sponsored conservation programs have intensified 
population increases and business growth in our three state service territory remains above the national average 
natural gas loads for space heating vary significantly with annual fluctuations in weather within our service territories 
the forward looking projections set forth above regarding retail load growth are based  in part  upon purchased economic forecasts and publicly available population and demographic studies 
the expectations regarding retail load growth are also based upon various assumptions  including assumptions relating to weather and economic and competitive conditions  internal analysis of company specific data  such as energy consumption patterns  internal business plans  and an assumption that we will incur no material loss of retail customers due to self generation or retail wheeling 
changes in actual experience can vary significantly from our forward looking projections 
environmental issues and other contingencies we are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the generation  transmission  distribution  service and storage facilities in which we have ownership interests are designed and operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws 
we monitor legislative and regulatory developments at all levels of government for environmental issues  particularly those with the potential to alter the operation and productivity of our generating plants and other assets 

table of contents avista corporation environmental laws and regulations may increase the operating costs of generating plants  increase the lead time and capital costs for the construction of new generating plants  require modification of our existing generating plants  require existing generating plant operations to be curtailed or shut down  reduce the amount of energy available from our generating plants  and restrict the types of generating plants that can be built 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in increases to capital expenditures and operating expenses 
we intend to seek recovery of any such costs through the ratemaking process 
rising concerns about long term global climate changes could have a significant effect on our business 
our operations could also be affected by changes in laws and regulations intended to mitigate the risk of global climate changes  including restrictions on the operation of our power generation resources 
changing temperatures and precipitation  including snowpack conditions  affect the availability and timing of the streamflows  which impacts hydroelectric generation 
changing temperatures could also increase or decrease customer demand 
greenhouse gas requirements could result in significant costs for us to comply with restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions 
such requirements could also preclude us from developing  operating or contracting with certain types of generating plants 
we continue to monitor and evaluate the possible adoption of national  regional  or state greenhouse gas requirements 
in particular  a greenhouse gas bill was passed by the legislature in the state of washington and a bill was approved by the us house of representatives 
there will most likely be continuing activity in the near future 
although we are actively monitoring developments for climate change and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions  it is important to note that we have relatively low emissions as compared to other investor owned utilities in the us with percent of our net generation capability from hydroelectric and a majority of our thermal generation fueled with natural gas  plus a commitment to energy efficiency  we are among the lowest carbon emitting utilities in the nation 
we have a climate change committee ccc an interdisciplinary team of management and other employees which is designed to anticipate and evaluate strategic needs and opportunities relating to climate change  analyze the company wide implications of various trends and proposals  develop recommendations on positions and action plans  and facilitate internal and external communications regarding climate change issues 
longer term issues involve emissions tracking and certification  providing recommendations for greenhouse gas reduction goals and activities  evaluating the merits of different reduction programs  actively participating in the development of legislation  and benchmarking climate change policies and activities against other organizations 
national legislation in june  the us house of representatives approved the american clean energy and security act of hr  which includes a mandatory cap and trade program for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  a national renewable electricity standard and a number of other energy related provisions 
the cap and trade program would begin for electric generators in and for natural gas local distribution companies in hr requires that greenhouse gas emissions be reduced by percent below levels by  percent by  percent by and percent by starting in  covered entities such as fossil fired power plants must submit to the epa allowances to emit equal to their greenhouse gas emissions 
a different bill with similar greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements s 
is now under consideration in the us senate 
state activities the states of washington and oregon have statutory targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
washington requires reductions to levels by  to percent below levels by  and to percent below levels by oregon s goals would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to percent below levels by and percent below levels by both states enacted their goals expecting that they would be met through a combination of renewable energy standards  cap and trade regulation  and complementary policies  such as energy efficiency codes for buildings and vehicle emission standards 
washington and oregon continue to participate in the 
table of contents avista corporation western climate initiative wci  along with the states of arizona  california  new mexico  utah and montana  and the canadian provinces of british columbia  manitoba  ontario and quebec 
the wci has developed a regional cap and trade program with an overall regional goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to percent below levels by in september  the wci members released recommendations for the design of such a program  which would apply cap and trade regulation to the electricity sector in and to emissions associated with the distribution of natural gas by a central element of the wci s recommendations is a requirement that its members regulate greenhouse gas emissions from sources of electricity that serve loads within their respective jurisdictions  even though those sources may be located beyond their boundaries 
this measure is intended to minimize emissions leakage and is a principal feature of california assembly bill ab 
ab was enacted in california in and obligates the state to implement greenhouse gas emission regulations 
the california air resources board  which has been charged to implement and enforce greenhouse gas emission regulations under ab  is on schedule to adopt cap and trade regulations by january  in  the governor of washington issued an executive order directing the washington department of ecology to estimate greenhouse gas emissions by sector and source and to identify potential reduction requirements for them in preparation for the eventual imposition of state and or federal greenhouse gas regulations 
the department of ecology has identified facilities that emit more than  metric tons of greenhouse gases annually and has forecasted that those facilities will need to reduce their emissions by percent in order for the state to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for our natural gas distribution system has been specifically identified as a facility and our thermal plants and contracts with thermal plants  including fossil fueled generation outside of the state have been generically deemed a facility for the purposes of potentially regulating emissions associated with the importation of power to serve our washington loads 
the state of washington has yet to disclose how it might intend to impose and enforce emission reductions 
washington and oregon apply a greenhouse gas emissions performance standard to electric generation facilities used to serve loads in their jurisdiction 
the emissions performance standard prevents utilities from entering into long term contracts five years or more to purchase energy produced by plants that have emission levels higher than the latest commercially available natural gas fired combined cycle combustion turbine technology 
washington s emission performance standard has been set by statute at  pounds of greenhouse gases per mwh until  at which time it will be reviewed and may be lowered by administrative rule to reflect the emissions profile of the latest commercially available combined cycle combustion turbine 
initiative measure i  the energy independence act  was passed into law through the general election in washington 
i requires investor owned  cooperative  and government owned electric utilities with over  customers to acquire qualified renewable energy resources and or renewable energy credits in incremental amounts until those resources or credits equal percent of the utility s total retail load in i also requires these utilities to meet biennial energy conservation targets  the first of which must be established in failure to comply with renewable energy and energy efficiency standards will result in penalties of at least per mwh being assessed against a utility for each mwh it is deficient in meeting a standard 
a utility would be deemed to comply with the renewable energy standard if it invests at least percent of its total annual retail revenue requirement on the incremental costs of renewable energy resources and or renewable energy credits 
electric integrated resource plan our most recent electric integrated resource plan irp  which we filed with the wutc and the ipuc in the third quarter  includes the acquisition of additional renewable resources such that  if the irp is implemented  we would be compliant with the requirements of i by the various milestone dates 
highlights of the irp include up to mw of wind power by which equates to approximately average megawatts  an additional mw of wind power by  mw of clean burning natural gas fired generation facilities  aggressive energy efficiency measures to reduce generation requirements by percent or mw  transmission upgrades are needed to integrate new generation resources into our system  and hydroelectric upgrades at existing facilities will generate additional renewable energy 
after a detailed analysis  we decided to postpone renewable resource acquisitions  including the potential construction of a wind generation project until the timeframe 
we plan to meet the state of washington s renewable energy standards until with a combination of qualified hydroelectric upgrades and the purchase of a small amount renewable energy credits from through the amount of renewable resources in our future irps could change if the cost effectiveness of those resources changes 

table of contents avista corporation as part of our irp  we included estimates of climate change into the retail load forecast 
the recent trend has been a warming climate compared to the year normal 
trends in heating and cooling degree days for spokane are roughly equal to the scientific community s predictions for this geographic area  implying a one degree warming every years 
incorporating the warming trend finds that in years summer load would be approximately amw higher than the year average 
in the winter  loads would be approximately amw lower in  for a net impact of a amw load decrease 
our projected system load for is  amw 
we do not expect this trend to have a material impact on our results of operations 
estimated costs of greenhouse gas emissions credits were also included in the development of the irp market prices 
chicago climate exchange in october  we became a member of the chicago climate exchange ccx  north america s only voluntary  verifiable and legally binding emissions reduction and trading marketplace for all six greenhouse gases 
members agree to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by percent from an established baseline by the ccx allows participants who exceed their reduction targets to bank or sell the excess ccx carbon financial instruments 
we liquidated our surplus credits in june and july the audit establishing our baseline emissions was completed and we received  of vintage ccx carbon financial instruments in september the emissions audit data will be submitted in the second quarter of we anticipate having surplus credits for the compliance year  and expect to receive them in the fourth quarter of national ambient air quality standards we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments at both the state and national levels for potential further restrictions on national ambient air quality standards naaqs 
new  more stringent ambient air quality standards were adopted or are being adopted by the epa for nitrogen dioxide  ozone and particulate matter 
we have thermal power plants in washington  idaho  montana and oregon 
even under the new standards  the epa and the states have designated most of the western states in which we operate as attainment areas for the new standards 
we do not anticipate any material impacts on our thermal plants from these new standards 
recent epa initiatives related to climate change after a public comment and review period  in december  the epa administrator signed two findings regarding greenhouse gases under section a of the clean air act 
the first finding is that the current and projected concentrations of the six key well mixed greenhouse gases carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide  hydrofluorocarbons  perfluorocarbons  and sulfur hexafluoride in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations 
the second finding is that the combined emissions of these well mixed greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to the greenhouse gas pollution which threatens public health and welfare 
in september  the epa published a final rule to regulate facilities emitting over  metric tons of greenhouse gases ghg a year under existing clean air act authority 
the rule became effective on december  data collection commenced january  and covered facilities will be required to submit their first ghg emissions report to the epa by march  based on rule applicability criteria  colstrip  coyote springs  and the rathdrum ct will be required to report ghgs 
these facilities currently report carbon dioxide to the epa under the acid rain program and it is expected that the operators of colstrip and coyote springs will be responsible for any additional ghg reporting 
based on our evaluation of historical emissions from  none of our other electrical generation facilities meet the threshold requirements 
the proposed rule also requires natural gas distribution system throughput be reported 
monitoring methods per the rule are currently in place and development of a ghg monitoring plan for covered facilities is currently underway and will be in place prior to the april  deadline for required monitoring method implementation 
the purpose of the plan is to document the process and procedures for collecting and reviewing the data needed to estimate annual ghg emissions 
coal ash management disposal currently  coal combustion byproducts ccbs are not regulated by the epa as a hazardous waste 
the epa is currently reconsidering the classification of ccbs under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
a draft proposal is under review at the office of budget and management  but no proposal regarding such regulation has been issued for public review or comment 
should the epa determine to regulate ccbs as a hazardous waste under the rcra  such action could have a significant impact on future operations of colstrip 
however  given that no rulemaking proposal has been issued  it is impossible to evaluate the impact of a future regulatory action 
we are tracking these developments as information becomes available 
western power market issues the ferc continues to conduct proceedings and investigations related to market controls within the western united states that include proposals by certain parties to impose refunds  and some of the ferc s decisions have been appealed in federal courts 
certain parties have asserted claims for significant refunds from us  which could result in 
table of contents avista corporation liabilities for refunding revenues recognized in prior periods 
we have joined other parties in opposing these proposals 
we believe that we have adequate reserves established for refunds that may be ordered 
the refund proceedings provide that any refunds would be offset against unpaid energy debts due to the same party 
as of december   our accounts receivable outstanding related to defaulting parties in california were fully offset by reserves for uncollected amounts and funds collected from defaulting parties 
see california refund proceeding and pacific northwest refund proceeding in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the refund proceedings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general our power supply cost varies because of several factors 
we optimize the mix of power resources to meet our retail customer requirements and other obligations 
we also use our resources and obtain resources from others in the wholesale power market including natural gas fuel markets 
hydroelectric generation is typically the least cost source of supply  but the amount of hydroelectric generation depends on streamflow conditions affected by both the volume and timing of precipitation  including snow melt patterns and other factors in the watersheds for our hydroelectric facilities 
thermal generation resource costs vary with fuel costs and other factors 
wholesale market prices tend to vary with natural gas fuel costs to the extent that natural gas fired resources are the least cost alternative in the region which is often the case in recent years 
generating resource availability and regional demand tend to impact energy prices  which affect our net power supply costs 
even with regulatory cost recovery mechanisms that address these power supply cost variations  a portion of the cost variation is not passed on to customers 
in addition  the timing of incurring costs can be significantly different than the timing for recovering costs  resulting in the need for a significant liquidity cushion 
our hydroelectric generation was slightly below normal based on a year average in and in eight of the past ten years 
we cannot determine if lower than normal hydroelectric generation will continue in future years 
when we have excess hydroelectric generation  its value varies with market prices and other displaceable resources 
when hydroelectric generation is below normal  the cost to obtain power from other sources is generally higher 
when hydroelectric generation is above normal  prices in the wholesale market are often depressed which can adversely impact our surplus sales revenues 
we are not able to predict how the combination of energy resources  energy loads  prices  rate recovery and other factors will ultimately drive deferred power costs and the timing of recovery of our costs in future periods 
see further information at avista utilities regulatory matters 
market prices for natural gas continue to be competitive compared to alternative fuel sources for customers  and we believe that natural gas should sustain its long term market advantage over competing energy sources based on the levels of existing reserves and potential natural gas development in the future 
growth has occurred in the natural gas business in recent years due to increased demand for natural gas in new construction and conversions from competing space and water heating energy sources to natural gas 
certain natural gas customers could by pass our natural gas system  reducing both revenues and recovery of fixed costs 
to reduce the potential for such by pass  we price natural gas services  including transportation contracts  competitively and have varying degrees of flexibility to price transportation and delivery rates by means of individual contracts 
these individual contracts are subject to state regulatory review and approval 
we have long term transportation contracts with several of our largest industrial customers 
this reduces the risk of these customers by passing our system in the foreseeable future and minimizes the impact on our earnings 
we engage in wholesale sales and purchases of energy commodities and  accordingly  are subject to commodity price risk  credit risk and other risks associated with these activities 
commodity price risk in general  price risk is driven by fluctuation in the market price of the commodity needed  held or traded 
the price of energy in wholesale markets is affected primarily by fundamental factors related to production costs and by other factors including weather and the resulting impact on retail loads 
we hedge our exposure to price risk by making forward commitments for energy purchases and sales as further described under risk management 
electricity prices are affected by a number of factors  including demand for electricity  the number of market participants and the willingness of market participants to trade  adequacy of generating reserve margins  
table of contents avista corporation scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities  availability of streamflows for hydroelectric generation  price and availability of fuel for thermal generating plants  and disruptions of or constraints on transmission facilities 
natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors  including amount of north american production and production capacity that can be delivered to our service areas  level of imports and exports  particularly from canada by pipeline and to a growing extent by lng  level of inventories and regional accessibility  demand for natural gas  including natural gas as fuel for electric generation  the number of market participants and the willingness of market participants to trade  global energy markets  including oil or other natural gas substitutes  and availability of pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from region to region 
any combination of these factors that results in a shortage of energy generally causes the market price to move upward 
factors such as a general economic downturn  increased proven energy reserves  or increased production generally reduce market prices for energy 
in addition to these factors  wholesale power markets are subject to regulatory constraints including price controls 
price risk also includes the risk of fluctuation in the market price of associated derivative commodity instruments such as options and forward contracts 
price risk may also be influenced to the extent that the performance or non performance by market participants of their contractual obligations and commitments affect the supply of  or demand for  the commodity 
we have mechanisms in each regulatory jurisdiction that provide for recovery of the majority of the changes in our power and natural gas costs 
the majority of power and natural gas costs exceeding the amount currently recovered through retail rates  excluding the erm deadband and other sharing components in washington  are deferred on our consolidated balance sheets for the opportunity for recovery through future retail rates 
these deferred power and natural gas costs are subject to review for prudence and recoverability and as such certain deferred costs may be disallowed by the respective regulatory agencies 
substantially all forward contracts to purchase or sell power and natural gas are recorded as assets or liabilities at market value with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability 
contracts that are not considered derivatives are generally accounted for on the accrual basis until they are settled or realized  unless there is a decline in the fair value of the contract that is determined to be other than temporary 
the following table presents energy commodity derivative fair values presented as a net asset or liability as of december  that are expected to settle in each respective year dollars in thousands purchases sales electric derivatives gas derivatives electric derivatives gas derivatives year physical financial physical financial physical financial physical financial thereafter credit risk credit risk relates to potential losses that we would incur as a result of non performance of contractual obligations by counterparties to deliver energy or make financial settlements 
we often extend credit to counterparties and customers  and we are exposed to the risk of not being able to collect amounts owed to us 
changes in market prices may dramatically alter the size of credit risk with counterparties  even when we establish conservative credit limits 
credit risk includes potential counterparty default due to circumstances relating directly to the counterparty  caused by market price changes  and relating to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 

table of contents avista corporation should a counterparty  customer or supplier fail to perform  we may be required to honor the underlying commitment or to replace existing contracts with contracts at then current market prices 
we seek to mitigate credit risk by entering into bilateral contracts that specify credit terms and protections against default  applying credit limits and duration criteria to existing and prospective counterparties  actively monitoring current credit exposures  and conducting some of our transactions on exchanges with clearing arrangements that essentially eliminate counterparty default risk 
our credit policies include an evaluation of the financial condition and credit ratings of counterparties  collateral requirements or other credit enhancements  such as letters of credit or parent company guarantees 
we also use standardized agreements that allow for the netting or offsetting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty or affiliated group 
however  despite mitigation efforts  defaults by our counterparties periodically occur 
we regularly evaluate counterparties credit exposure for future settlements and delivery obligations 
we reduce or eliminate open unsecured credit limits and implement other credit risk reduction measures for parties perceived to have increased default risk 
counterparty collateral is used to offset our credit risk where unsettled net positions and future obligations by counterparties to pay us or deliver to us warrant 
we have concentrations of suppliers and customers in the electric and natural gas industries including electric utilities  electric generators and transmission providers  natural gas producers and pipelines  financial institutions  and energy marketing and trading companies 
in addition  we have concentrations of credit risk related to geographic location in the western united states and western canada 
these concentrations of counterparties and concentrations of geographic location may affect our overall exposure to credit risk because the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in conditions 
credit risk also involves the exposure that counterparties perceive related to our ability to perform deliveries and settlement under physical and financial energy contracts 
these counterparties may seek assurances of performance in the form of letters of credit  prepayment  or cash deposits 
credit exposure can change significantly in periods of price volatility 
as a result  sudden and significant demands may be made against our credit facilities and cash 
we actively monitor the exposure to possible collateral calls and take steps to minimize capital requirements 
counterparties credit exposure to us is dynamic in normal markets and may change significantly in more volatile markets 
the amount of potential default risk to us  from each counterparty  depends on the extent of forward contracts  unsettled transactions and market prices 
there is a risk that we may seek additional collateral from counterparties that are unable or unwilling to provide 
credit risks related to our retail customer base include the extent to which customers do not pay or are slow to pay for energy we have delivered to them 
we are allowed to recover normal credit losses in retail rates but economic conditions for our customers may result in unrecovered credit losses 
we also extend credit generally for up to five years in certain circumstances to construction developers for the cost of utility infrastructure investment 
the infrastructure costs are typically recovered when new customers begin receiving utility service but to the extent that customers do not connect as planned  we may carry credit risks with these developers 
we maintain credit reserves that are based on the evaluation of the credit risk of the overall portfolio 
based on our credit policies  exposures and credit reserves  we do not anticipate a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of counterparty nonperformance 

table of contents avista corporation interest rate risk we are affected by fluctuating interest rates related to a portion of our existing debt and our future borrowing requirements 
we manage interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
additionally interest rate risk is managed by monitoring market conditions when timing the issuance of long term debt and optional debt redemptions and through the use of fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities 
we also enter into financial derivative instruments  which may include interest rate swaps and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure 
we did not have any interest rate swap contracts outstanding as of december  the interest rate on million of long term debt to affiliated trusts is adjusted quarterly  reflecting current market rates 
amounts borrowed under our million and million committed line of credit agreements have variable interest rates 
the weighted average variable rate on outstanding short term borrowings was percent at december  the following table shows our long term debt including current portion and related weighted average interest rates  by expected maturity dates as of december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate long term debt weighted average interest rate variable rate long term debt to affiliated trusts weighted average interest rate foreign currency risk a significant portion of our utility natural gas supply including fuel for electric generation is obtained from canadian sources 
most of those transactions are executed in us dollars  which avoids foreign currency risk 
a portion of our short term natural gas transactions and long term canadian transportation contracts are committed based on canadian currency prices and settled within sixty days with us dollars 
in early  we implemented a process to economically hedge a portion of the foreign currency risk by purchasing canadian currency when such commodity transactions are initiated 
this risk has not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and these differences in cost related to currency fluctuations were included with natural gas supply costs for ratemaking 
as of december   we had a current derivative liability for foreign currency hedges of less than million included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had entered into canadian currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million million canadian 
risk management we use a variety of techniques to manage risks for energy resources and wholesale energy market activities 
we have an energy resources risk policy and control procedures to manage these risks  both qualitative and quantitative 
our risk management committee established our risk management policy for energy resources 
the risk management committee is comprised of certain officers and other management 
the audit committee of the company s board of directors periodically reviews and discusses risk assessment and risk management policies  including the company s material financial and accounting risk exposures and the steps management has undertaken to control them 
our risk management committee reviews the status of risk exposures through regular reports and meetings and it monitors compliance with our risk management policy and control procedures 
nonetheless  adverse changes in commodity prices  generating capacity  customer loads  regulation and other factors may result in losses of earnings  cash flows and or fair values 
our risk management committee also established a wholesale energy markets credit policy 
the credit policy is designed to reduce the risk of financial loss in case counterparties default on delivery or settlement obligations and to conserve our liquidity as other parties may place credit limits or require cash collateral 
we measure the volume of monthly  quarterly and annual energy imbalances between projected power loads and resources 
the measurement process is based on expected loads at fixed prices including those subject to retail rates and expected resources to the extent that costs are essentially fixed by virtue of known fuel supply costs or projected hydroelectric conditions 
to the extent that expected costs are not fixed  either because of volume mismatches between loads and resources or because fuel cost is not locked in through fixed price contracts or derivative 
table of contents avista corporation instruments  our risk policy guides the process to manage this open forward position over a period of time 
normal operations result in seasonal mismatches between power loads and available resources 
we are able to vary the operation of generating resources to match parts of hourly  daily and weekly load fluctuations 
we use the wholesale power markets  including the natural gas market as it relates to power generation fuel  to sell projected resource surpluses and obtain resources when deficits are projected 
we buy and sell fuel for thermal generation facilities based on comparative power market prices and marginal costs of fueling and operating available generating facilities and the relative economics of substitute market purchases for generating plant operation 
effective january   the natural gas fired lancaster power purchase agreement was added to our utility resource portfolio  with the potential to significantly increase the extent of transactions for natural gas fuel hedging and plant optimization 
to address the impact on our operations of energy market price volatility  our hedging practices for electricity including fuel for generation and natural gas extend beyond the current operating year 
executing this extended hedging program may increase our credit risks  particularly in consideration of the national economic conditions with resultant financial stress among energy market participants 
our credit risk management process is designed to mitigate such credit risks through limit setting  contract protections and counterparty diversification  among other practices 
electric load resource imbalances within a planning horizon up to months ahead are compared against established volumetric guidelines 
management determines the timing and actions to manage the imbalances 
we also assess available resource alternatives and actions that are appropriate for longer term planning periods 
expected load and resource volumes for forward periods are based on monthly and quarterly averages that may vary significantly from the actual loads and resources within any individual month or operating day 
future projections of resources are updated as forecasted streamflows and other factors differ from prior estimates 
forward power markets may be illiquid  and market products available may not match our desired transaction size and shape 
therefore  open imbalance positions exist at any given time 
our projected natural gas loads and resources are regularly reviewed by operating management and the risk management committee 
to manage the impacts of volatile natural gas prices  we seek to procure natural gas through a diversified mix of spot market purchases and forward fixed price purchases from various supply basins and time periods 
we have an active hedging program that extends four years into the future with the goal of reducing price volatility in our natural gas supply costs 
we use natural gas storage capacity to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices are likely to be seasonally lower 
securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years at multiple basins mitigates potential adverse impacts of significant purchase requirements in a volatile price environment
