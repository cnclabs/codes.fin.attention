item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains further information 
we are currently engaged in the haynesville and clarence compression projects 
gulf crossing our gulf crossing pipeline system originates near sherman  texas  and proceeds to the perryville  louisiana area 
the market areas for gulf crossing are in the midwest  northeast  southeast and florida through interconnections with gulf south  texas gas and unaffiliated pipelines 
gulf south our gulf south pipeline system is located along the gulf coast in the states of texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama and florida 
the on system markets directly served by the gulf south system are generally located in eastern texas  louisiana  southern mississippi  southern alabama  and the florida panhandle 
these markets include ldcs and municipalities located across the system  including new orleans  louisiana  jackson  mississippi  mobile  alabama  and pensacola  florida  and end users located across the system  including the baton rouge to new orleans industrial corridor and lake charles  louisiana 
gulf south also has indirect access to off system markets through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities 
these pipeline interconnections provide access to markets throughout the northeastern and southeastern us gulf south has two natural gas storage facilities 
the gas storage facility located in bistineau  louisiana has approximately bcf of working gas storage capacity from which gulf south offers firm and interruptible storage service  including no notice transportation service nns 
gulf south s jackson  mississippi  gas storage facility has approximately bcf of working gas storage capacity which is used for operational purposes and is not offered for sale to the market 
texas gas our texas gas pipeline system originates in louisiana  east texas and arkansas and runs north and east through louisiana  arkansas  mississippi  tennessee  kentucky  indiana  and into ohio  with smaller diameter lines extending into illinois 
the market area directly served by texas gas encompasses eight states in the south and midwest and includes the memphis  tennessee  louisville  kentucky  cincinnati and dayton  ohio  and evansville and indianapolis  indiana metropolitan areas 
texas gas also has indirect market access to the northeast through interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines 
a large portion of the gas delivered by the texas gas system is used for heating during the winter months  resulting in higher daily requirements during winter months 
texas gas owns nine natural gas storage fields  of which it owns the majority of the working and base gas 
texas gas uses this gas to meet the operational requirements of its transportation and storage customers and the requirements of its nns  which allows customers to borrow gas from storage during the winter season to be repaid in kind during the following summer season 
texas gas also offers summer no notice transportation service sns  which is designed primarily to meet the needs of electrical power generation facilities during the summer season  and other firm and interruptible storage services 
the following table provides information for each of our operating subsidiaries as of december   except for average daily throughput which is for the year ended december  pipeline miles of pipeline peak day delivery capacity working gas storage capacity average daily throughput bcf d bcf bcf d gulf crossing gulf south texas gas the designated peak day transmission capacity is expected to increase to bcf per day from the addition of compression  which is expected to be placed in service in the first quarter the average daily throughput was adversely impacted because we operated the pipeline expansion projects at reduced operating pressures and shut down segments of the pipelines for periods of time to remediate the pipe anomalies 
expansion and growth projects  in item of this report  contains more information regarding the pipe anomalies and related remediation 
nature of contracts we contract with our customers to provide transportation services and storage services on a firm and interruptible basis 
we also provide bundled firm transportation and storage services  which we refer to as nns and sns 
in addition  we provide interruptible pal services 
transportation services 
we offer transportation services on both a firm and interruptible basis 
our customers choose  based upon their particular needs  the applicable mix of services depending upon availability of pipeline capacity  price of service and the volume and timing of the customer s requirements 
firm transportation customers reserve a specific amount of pipeline capacity at specified receipt and delivery points on our system 
firm customers generally pay fees based on the quantity of capacity reserved regardless of use  plus a commodity and a fuel charge paid on the volume of gas actually transported 
capacity reservation revenues derived from a firm service contract are generally consistent during the contract term  but can be higher in winter periods than the rest of the year  especially for nns agreements 
firm transportation contracts generally range in term from one to ten years  although firm transportation contracts can be offered for terms greater than ten years or less than one year 
in providing interruptible transportation service  we agree to transport gas for a customer when capacity is available 
interruptible transportation service customers pay a commodity charge only for the volume of gas actually transported  plus a fuel charge 
interruptible transportation agreements have terms ranging from day to day to multiple years  with rates that change on a daily  monthly or seasonal basis 
storage services 
we offer customers storage services on both a firm and interruptible basis 
firm storage customers reserve a specific amount of storage capacity  including injection and withdrawal rights  while interruptible customers receive storage capacity and injection and withdrawal rights when it is available 
similar to firm transportation customers  firm storage customers generally pay fees based on the quantity of capacity reserved plus an injection and withdrawal fee 
firm storage contracts typically range in term from one to ten years 
interruptible storage customers pay for the volume of gas actually stored plus injection and withdrawal fees 
generally  interruptible storage agreements are for monthly terms 
ferc has authorized gulf south to charge market based rates for its firm and interruptible storage services and texas gas is authorized to charge market based rates for the firm and interruptible storage services associated with a portion of its storage capacity 
no notice service and summer no notice service 
nns and sns consist of a combination of firm transportation and storage services that allow customers to withdraw gas from storage with little or no notice 
customers pay a reservation charge based upon the capacity reserved plus a commodity and a fuel charge based on the volume of gas actually transported 
in accordance with its tariff  texas gas loans stored gas to its no notice customers who are obligated to repay the gas in kind 
parking and lending service 
pal is an interruptible service offered to customers providing them the ability to park inject or borrow withdraw gas into or out of our pipeline systems at a specific location for a specific period of time 
customers pay for pal service in advance or on a monthly basis depending on the terms of the agreement 
customers and markets served we transport natural gas for a broad mix of customers  including marketers  producers  ldcs  electric power generators  intrastate and interstate pipelines and direct industrial users located throughout the gulf coast  midwest and northeast regions of the us we contract directly with end use customers and with marketers  producers and other third parties who provide transportation and storage services to end users 
based on revenues  our customer mix was as follows marketers  producers  ldcs  power generators  pipelines and industrial end users and others 
based upon revenues  our deliveries were as follows pipeline interconnects  ldcs  storage activities  power generators  industrial end users and other 
one customer  devon energy production company  lp  accounted for approximately of our operating revenues 
refer to item a  risk factors  regarding risks associated with our customers 
marketers 
natural gas marketing companies utilize our services to provide services to our other customer groups as well as to customer groups in off system markets 
the services may include combined gas supply management  transportation and storage services to support the needs of the other customer groups 
approximately of the marketers are sponsored by ldcs and approximately are sponsored by producers 
producers 
producers of natural gas use our services to transport gas supplies from producing areas  primarily from the gulf coast region  including shale plays in texas  louisiana  oklahoma and arkansas  to supply pools and to other customers on and off of our systems 
producers contract with us for storage services to store excess production and optimize the ultimate sales prices for their gas 
ldcs 
most of our ldc customers use firm transportation services  including nns 
we serve approximately ldcs at more than delivery locations across our pipeline systems 
the demand of these customers peaks during the winter heating season 
power generators 
we have the ability to serve more than natural gas fired power generation facilities in ten states 
we are directly connected to of these facilities 
the demand of the power generating customers peaks during the summer cooling season which is counter to the winter season peak demands of the ldcs 
most of our power generating customers use a combination of sns  firm and interruptible transportation services 
pipelines off system 
our pipeline systems serve as feeder pipelines for long haul interstate pipelines serving markets throughout the midwestern  northeastern and southeastern portions of the us we have numerous interconnects with third party interstate and intrastate pipelines 
industrial end users 
we provide approximately industrial facilities with a combination of firm and interruptible transportation services 
our systems are directly connected to industrial facilities in the baton rouge to new orleans industrial corridor  lake charles  louisiana  mobile  alabama and pensacola  florida 
we can also access the houston ship channel through third party pipelines 
competition we compete with other pipelines to maintain current business levels and to serve new demand and markets 
we also compete with other pipelines for contracts with producers that would support new growth opportunities for us 
the principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity  rates  terms of service  access to supply and flexibility and reliability of service 
competition is particularly strong in the midwest and gulf coast states where we compete with numerous existing pipelines  including the rockies express pipeline that transports natural gas from northern colorado to eastern ohio and the mid continent express pipeline that transports gas from oklahoma and texas to alabama 
we will also directly compete with several new pipeline projects that are proposed or under development  including projects originating in the haynesville shale area more specifically  the tiger pipeline that will transport gas to perryville  louisiana and the haynesville extension pipeline that will transport gas to the industrial complex in southeastern louisiana and the fayetteville express pipeline which will originate in the fayetteville shale area and continue eastward to mississippi 
in addition  regulators continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of our traditional customers 
as a result of the regulators policies  segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with our pipeline services 
additionally  natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to our customers  including electricity  coal and fuel oils 
the natural gas industry has built  or is in the process of completing  significant new pipeline infrastructure that will support the development of unconventional natural gas supply basins across the us additional pipeline infrastructure projects are being proposed 
these new pipeline developments have increased competition in certain pipeline markets  resulting in lower price differentials between physical locations basis spreads 
basis spreads can impact the rates we will be able to negotiate with our customers when contracts come up for renewal 
despite these competitive conditions  assuming that customers use all of their reserved capacity  substantially all of the operating capacity on our pipeline systems is contracted for with a weighted average contract life of approximately years  although each year a portion of our capacity becomes subject to re contracting risk 
for example approximately of our contracts are due to expire in seasonality our revenues can be affected by weather and natural gas price levels and volatility 
weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power generation  which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across our pipeline systems 
colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs  both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput 
while traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurred during the winter months driven by heating needs  the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has reduced the seasonality of our revenues over time 
during  approximately of our revenues were recognized in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
government regulation federal energy regulatory commission 
ferc regulates our operating subsidiaries under the natural gas act of nga and the natural gas policy act of ferc regulates  among other things  the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension  enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction 
where required  our operating subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by ferc covering certain of their facilities  activities and services 
ferc also prescribes accounting treatment for our operating subsidiaries which is separately reported pursuant to forms filed with ferc 
the regulatory books and records and other activities of our operating subsidiaries may be periodically audited by ferc 
the maximum rates that may be charged by our operating subsidiaries for gas transportation are established through ferc s cost of service rate making process 
the maximum rates that may be charged by us for storage services on texas gas  with the exception of approximately bcf of working gas capacity on that system  are also established through ferc s cost of service rate making process 
key determinants in ferc s cost of service rate making process are the costs of providing service  the allowed rate of return  throughput assumptions  the allocation of costs  the capital structure and the rate design 
ferc has authorized gulf south to charge market based rates for its firm and interruptible storage 
texas gas is authorized to charge market based rates for the firm and interruptible storage services associated with approximately bcf of its storage capacity 
texas gas is prohibited from placing new rates into effect prior to november   and neither gulf south nor texas gas has an obligation to file a new rate case 
gulf crossing will have to either file a rate case or justify its initial firm transportation rates by the end of the first quarter us department of transportation dot 
we are regulated by dot under the natural gas pipeline safety act of  as amended by title i of the pipeline safety act of  which regulates safety requirements in the design  construction  operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipelines 
we have received authority from the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa  an agency of dot  to operate our recently completed inch pipeline expansion projects under special permits that will allow us to operate the pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures of up to of the pipe s specified minimum yield strength smys 
we are seeking authority from phmsa to operate our fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures 
we will need to operate each of these pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures in order to transport all of the volumes we have contracted for with our customers 
phmsa retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for us to operate these pipelines at higher pressures 
other 
our operations are also subject to extensive federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment 
such regulations impose  among other things  restrictions  liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation  handling  use  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills  releases and emissions of various substances into the environment 
environmental regulations also require that our facilities  sites and other properties be operated  maintained  abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 
these laws include  for example the clean air act and analogous state laws which impose obligations related to air emissions  including  in the case of the clean air act  greenhouse gas emissions  which we will be required to report to the environmental protection agency epa beginning in march  the water pollution control act  commonly referred to as the clean water act  and analogous state laws which regulate discharge of wastewaters from our facilities into state and federal waters  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly referred to as cercla  or the superfund law  and analogous state laws which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal  the resource conservation and recovery act  and analogous state laws which impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities

item a 
risk factors our business faces many risks 
we have described below some of the more material risks which we and our subsidiaries face 
there may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be material that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries 
each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  including our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the sec or make available to the public should be carefully considered and evaluated before investing in any securities issued by us 
business risks we need to obtain and maintain authority from phmsa to operate at higher than normal operating pressures 
we have entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers which would utilize the maximum design capacity of our recently completed inch pipeline expansion projects and our fayetteville lateral assuming that we operate those pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures up to smys  which increases the pipeline s peak day transmission capacity from that available at normal operating pressures up to smys 
in december  we received authority from phmsa to operate our inch pipeline expansion projects at higher than normal operating pressures 
if phmsa were to withdraw such authority we would not be able to transport all of our contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipelines  beginning in mid  or we could incur additional costs to re obtain such authority or seek alternate ways to meet our contractual obligations  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are seeking authority from phmsa to operate our fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures 
unless we obtain such authority from phmsa  we will not be able to operate the fayetteville lateral at its anticipated peak day transmission capacity  and beginning in mid we will not be able to transport all of the contracted for volumes on that pipeline 
in addition  we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs to inspect  test and remediate pipe segments on the fayetteville lateral in order to obtain  or maintain if granted  authority to operate at higher than normal operating pressures or to develop alternative ways to meet our contractual obligations  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
phmsa retains discretion as to whether to grant  or to maintain in force  authority to operate a pipeline at higher than normal operating pressures 
we may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates 
our primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time existing transportation contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation 
as of december   approximately of the contracts for firm transportation capacity on our pipeline systems will expire during upon expiration  we may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long term basis 
key drivers that influence the rates that our customers are willing to pay for transportation is the price differential of natural gas between physical locations  which can be affected by  among other things  the availability and supply of natural gas  available capacity  storage inventories  weather and general market demand in the respective areas 
the extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to our markets  development of new supplies located near key markets  the growth in demand for natural gas in our markets  whether the market will continue to support long term contracts  the current price differentials  or market price spreads between various receipt and delivery points on our pipelines  and the effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices 
increased competition could result in lower contracted capacity on our pipelines  decreased rates for our services and reduced revenues 
we compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines in the transportation and storage of natural gas 
competition is particularly strong in the midwest and gulf coast states where we compete with numerous existing pipelines  such as the rockies express pipeline and the mid continent express pipeline 
we will also directly compete with several new pipeline projects that are proposed or under development  including projects originating in the haynesville shale area more specifically  the tiger pipeline that will transport gas to perryville  louisiana and the haynesville extension pipeline that will transport gas to the industrial complex in southeastern louisiana and the fayetteville express pipeline which will originate in the fayetteville shale area and continue eastward to mississippi 
for new growth and expansion projects  we compete with other pipelines for contracts mainly with producers that would support such projects in order to transport their gas to market areas 
at an industry level  the various natural gas supply areas compete against one another to reach optimal market areas  and natural gas  as a commodity  competes with other forms of energy available to our customers  including electricity  coal and fuel oils  and other alternative fuel resources 
our ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by competition or changing market conditions 
the principle elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity  rates  terms of service  access to gas supplies  flexibility and reliability 
ferc s policies promote competition in gas markets by increasing the number of gas transportation options available to our customer base 
increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by our pipeline systems or  in instances where we do not have long term contracts with fixed rates  could force us to decrease our transportation or storage rates charged to our customers 
competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that could significantly decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by our operating subsidiaries  such as a recession or adverse economic conditions  weather  higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas 
the regulatory program that applies to interstate pipelines is different than the regulatory program that applies to many of our competitors that are not regulated interstate pipelines 
this difference in regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete a project when it is regulated at the federal level 
we compete against a number of intrastate pipelines which have significant regulatory advantages over us because of the absence of ferc regulation 
in view of potential rate advantages and construction and service flexibility available to intrastate pipelines  we may lose customers and throughput to intrastate competitors 
continued development of new supply sources could impact demand 
the discovery of non traditional natural gas production areas nearer to key market areas we access directly  or indirectly through third party pipeline interconnects  may compete with gas originating in production areas connected to our system 
for example  the marcellus shale in pennsylvania  new york  west virginia and ohio  may cause gas in supply areas connected to our system to be diverted to markets other than our traditional market areas and may adversely affect capacity utilization on our systems and our ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows 
in addition to supply volumes from the marcellus shale  gas from the rocky mountains  canada and lng import terminals may compete with and displace volumes from the gulf coast and mid continent supply sources in order to serve the northeast  midwest and east coast markets 
the displacement of gas originating in supply areas connected to our pipeline systems by these new supply sources that are closer to the end use markets could result in lower transportation revenues  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are undertaking and may continue to pursue complex pipeline or storage projects which involve significant risks that may adversely affect our business 
we have recently completed several pipeline expansion projects and we may also undertake additional pipeline or storage projects in the future 
in pursuing previous projects  we have experienced significant cost overruns and we may experience cost increases in the future 
we have also experienced delays in constructing and commissioning previous projects and may experience additional delays or cost increases in the future resulting from a variety of factors  including but not limited to the following delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  including delays in receiving authorization from phmsa to operate at higher than normal operating pressures under special permits  difficult construction conditions  including adverse weather conditions  delays in obtaining  or high demand for  key materials  and shortages of qualified labor and escalating costs of labor and materials resulting from the high level of construction activity in the pipeline industry 
in pursuing current or future projects  we could experience delays or cost increases for the reasons described above or as a result of other factors 
we may not be able to complete our current or future projects on the expected terms  cost or schedule  or at all 
in addition  we cannot be certain that  if completed  we will be able to operate these projects  or that they will perform  in accordance with our expectations 
other areas of our business may suffer as a result of the diversion of our management s attention and other resources from our other business concerns to our projects 
any of these factors could impair our ability to realize revenues from our current or future projects sufficient to cover the costs associated with owning and operating these pipelines and to provide the benefits we had anticipated from the projects  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  including our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by our customers 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
our exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by us to them under certain nns and pal services 
our ferc gas tariffs only allow us to require limited credit support in the event that our transportation customers are unable to pay for our services 
if any of our significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by us or contracted for with us  or to repay the gas they owe us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  as contracts expire  the failure of any of our customers could also result in the non renewal of contracted capacity  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a of this report contains more information on credit risk arising from gas loaned to customers 
we depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
the loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in our revenues 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues 
for example  devon energy production company  lp represented over of our revenues and we expect this customer to continue to account for more than of our revenues 
additionally  we may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts and key customers on favorable terms 
the loss of all or even a portion of the contracted volumes of these customers  as a result of competition  creditworthiness or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating revenues and cash flows 
significant changes in energy prices could affect natural gas market supply and demand  or potentially reduce the competitiveness of natural gas compared with other forms of energy available to our customers  which could reduce system throughput and adversely affect our revenues and available cash 
due to the natural decline in traditional gas production connected to our system  our success depends on our ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas  which is dependent on factors beyond our control including the price level of natural gas 
in general terms  the price of natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  seasonal trends and hurricane disruptions  the relationship between the available supplies and the demand for natural gas  the availability of lng  the availability of adequate transportation capacity  storage inventory levels  the price and availability of other forms of energy  the effect of energy conservation measures  the nature and extent of  and changes in  governmental regulation  for example greenhouse gas legislation and taxation  and the anticipated future prices of natural gas  lng and other commodities 
it is difficult to predict future changes in gas prices  however the abundance of natural gas supply discoveries over the last few years and global economic slowdown would generally indicate a bias toward downward pressure on prices 
downward movement in gas prices could negatively impact producers in nontraditional supply areas such as the barnett shale  the bossier sands  the caney woodford shale  the fayetteville shale and the haynesville shale  including producers who have contracted for capacity with us 
significant financial difficulties experienced by our producer customers could impact their ability to pay for services rendered or otherwise reduce their demand for our services 
high natural gas prices may result in a reduction in the demand for natural gas 
a reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on our systems  reduce the demand for our services and could result in the non renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire 
our revolving credit agreement contains operating and financial covenants that restrict our business and financing activities 
our revolving credit agreement contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities 
for example  our credit agreement limits our ability to make loans or investments  make material changes to the nature of our business  merge  consolidate or engage in asset sales  or grant liens or make negative pledges 
the agreement also requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the agreement of no more than five to one  which limits the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur 
future financing agreements we may enter into may contain similar or more restrictive covenants 
our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreement may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
if market or other economic conditions or our financial performance deteriorate  our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired 
if we are not able to incur additional indebtedness we may need to sell additional equity securities to raise needed capital  which would be dilutive to our existing equity holders 
if we default under our credit agreement or another financing agreement  significant additional restrictions may become applicable  including a restriction on our ability to make distributions to unitholders 
in addition  a default could result in a significant portion of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable  and our lenders could terminate their commitment to make further loans to us 
in such event  we would not have  and may not be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
our natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to ferc s rate making policies which could limit our ability to recover the full cost of operating our pipelines  including earning a reasonable return 
we are subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates we can charge for our transportation and storage operations 
for our cost based services  ferc establishes both the maximum and minimum rates we can charge 
the basic elements that ferc considers are the cost of providing the service  the volumes of gas being transported  how costs are allocated between services  the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn 
while neither gulf south nor texas gas has an obligation to file a rate case  our gulf crossing pipeline has an obligation to file either a rate case or a cost and revenue study by the end of the first quarter to justify its rates 
customers of our subsidiaries or ferc can challenge the existing rates on any of our pipelines 
ferc recently challenged the rates of three non affiliated pipelines 
such a challenge against us could adversely affect our ability to establish reasonable transportation rates  to charge rates that would cover future increases in our costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain our current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return 
additionally  ferc can propose changes or modifications to any of its existing rate related policies 
if our subsidiaries were to file a rate case  or if we have to defend our rates in a proceeding commenced by a customer or ferc  we would be required  among other things  to establish that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in our cost of service is just and reasonable 
under current ferc policy  since we are a limited partnership and do not pay us federal income taxes  this would require us to show that our unitholders or their ultimate owners are subject to federal income taxation 
to support such a showing  our general partner may elect to require owners of our units to re certify their status as being subject to us federal income taxation on the income generated by our subsidiaries or we may attempt to provide other evidence 
we can provide no assurance that the evidence we might provide to ferc will be sufficient to establish that our unitholders or their ultimate owners are subject to us federal income tax liability on the income generated by our jurisdictional pipelines 
if we are unable to make such a showing  ferc could disallow a substantial portion of the income tax allowance included in the determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by our pipeline subsidiaries  which could result in a reduction of such maximum rates from current levels 
we may not be able to recover all of our costs through existing or future rates 
an adverse determination in any future rate proceeding brought by or against any of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by ferc  in addition to ferc rules and regulations related to the rates we can charge for our services 
ferc s regulatory authority extends to operating terms and conditions of service  the types of services we may offer to our customers  construction of new facilities  creation  extension or abandonment of services or facilities  accounts and records  and relationships with certain types of affiliated companies involved in the natural gas business 
ferc s action in any of these areas or modifications of its current regulations can adversely impact our ability to compete for business  to construct new facilities  offer new services or to recover the full cost of operating our pipelines 
this regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project 
the federal regulatory approval and compliance process could raise the costs of such projects to the point where they are no longer sufficiently timely or cost competitive when compared to competing projects that are not subject to the federal regulatory regime 
ferc regulates the type of services we can offer  the terms and conditions of those services and has authority to review pipeline contracts to ensure that the services  rates and charges are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory 
ferc has various regulatory policies upon which it relies to protect against undue discrimination 
one such policy is to monitor the terms and conditions of transportation service contracts for any material deviation from the pipeline s tariff 
if ferc determines that a term of any such contract  at the time it is entered into or during the term of that agreement  deviates in a material manner from a pipeline s tariff  ferc can  among other potential remedies  order the pipeline to remove the term from the contract and execute and re file a new contract with ferc  or alternatively  amend its tariff to include the deviating term  thereby offering it to all shippers 
if ferc audits a pipeline s contracts or other aspects of our pipeline business and finds material deviations or other violations  ferc could conduct a formal enforcement investigation  resulting in penalties and or ongoing compliance obligations 
should we fail to comply with all applicable statutes  rules  regulations and orders administered or issued by ferc  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 
under the energy policy act of  the ferc has civil penalty authority under the nga to impose penalties for current violations of up to million per day for each violation 
we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the environment which may expose us to significant costs  liabilities and loss of revenues 
our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment 
these laws include  for example  the clean air act  the water pollution control act  commonly referred to as the clean water act  cercla or the superfund law  the resource conservation and recovery act and analogous state laws 
the existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted in the future and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to our operations or facilities 
compliance with current or future environmental regulations could require significant expenditures and the failure to comply with current or future regulations might result in the imposition of fines and penalties 
current rate structures  customer contracts and prevailing market conditions might not allow us to recover the additional costs incurred to comply with new environmental requirements and we might not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals for certain projects 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them  we may be required to shut down certain facilities or become subject to additional costs 
we face risks associated with global climate change 
governments around the world are beginning to address climate change issues 
beginning in march  we will be required to file reports with the epa regarding greenhouse gas emissions from our facilities  mainly our compressor stations  pursuant to final rules issued by the epa regarding the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from sources in the us that annually emit  or more metric tons of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  methane and others 
in december  the epa made a determination that greenhouse gases are a threat to the public health and the environment and may be regulated as air pollutants under the clean air act 
additional government or legislative action may be initiated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions along with other government actions that may have the effect of requiring or encouraging reduced consumption or production of natural gas 
some states have already adopted laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions  although none of the states in which we operate have adopted such laws 
it is anticipated that federal legislation  which could consist of an emissions cap and trade system  may be enacted in the us in the near future 
depending on the particular regulation adopted  we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations for example  our compressor units 
in addition  compliance with any new federal or state laws and regulations requiring adoption of greenhouse gas control programs or imposing restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide in areas of the us in which we conduct business could adversely affect the demand for and the cost to produce and transport natural gas which would adversely affect our business 
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located  which could disrupt our operations or result in increased costs 
we obtain the rights to construct and operate certain of our pipelines and related facilities on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of increased costs to maintain necessary use of land in accordance with the agreements that convey to us those rights 
additionally  if we do not comply with the terms of those agreements  our rights could be restricted which could disrupt our operations 
we are subject to strict safety regulations which may impose significant costs and liabilities on us 
under phmsa regulations  we are required to develop and maintain integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 
the regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting  the replacement of some of our pipeline segments  the addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities 
any repair  remediation  preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 
we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees  state and local governmental authorities and local residents 
should we fail to comply with phmsa regulations  osha or state statutes and general industry standards regulating the protection of the health and safety of workers  or keep adequate records or monitor pipeline integrity or occupational exposure to regulated substances  we could be subject to penalties and fines and or otherwise incur significant costs to restore compliance 
our operations are subject to catastrophic losses  operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured 
there are a variety of operating risks inherent in our natural gas transportation and storage operations such as leaks  explosions and mechanical problems 
additionally  the nature and location of our business may make us susceptible to catastrophic losses from hurricanes or other named storms  particularly with regard to our assets in the gulf coast region  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  explosions  severe winter weather and fires 
any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of our operations  substantial repair costs  personal injury or loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses 
the location of pipelines near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from some of these risks 
we currently possess property  business interruption and general liability insurance  but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost 
moreover  such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms 
the insurance coverage we do obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or all potential losses 
we are subject to litigation 
we are subject to litigation in the normal course of business 
litigation is costly and time consuming to defend and could result in material expense 
for a discussion of our current legal proceedings  see note in item of this report 
possible terrorist activities or military actions could adversely affect our business 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the us and its allies might lead to increased political  economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas  which could affect the markets for our natural gas transportation and storage services 
while we are taking steps that we believe are appropriate to increase the security of our assets  we may not be able to completely secure our assets  completely protect them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in particular  we might experience increased capital or operating costs to implement increased security 
our general partner and its affiliates own a controlling interest in us  have conflicts of interest and owe us only limited fiduciary duties  which may permit them to favor their own interests 
at december   bphc  a subsidiary of loews  owned a majority of our limited partner interests and owns and controls our general partner  which controls us 
although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders  the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to bphc 
furthermore  certain directors and officers of our general partner are also directors or officers of affiliates of our general partner 
conflicts of interest may arise between bphc and its subsidiaries  including our general partner  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders  on the other hand 
in resolving these conflicts  our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders 
these potential conflicts include  among others  the following situations bphc and its affiliates may engage in competition with us 
neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires bphc or its affiliates other than our general partner to pursue a business strategy that favors us 
directors and officers of bphc and its affiliates have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interest of bphc shareholders  which may be contrary to our interests 
our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us  such as bphc and its affiliates  in resolving conflicts of interest  which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders 
some officers of our general partner who provide services to us may devote time to affiliates of our general partner and may be compensated for services rendered to such affiliates 
our partnership agreement limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of our general partner and the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that  without these limitations  might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
by purchasing common units  unitholders are consenting to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable law 
our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  borrowings  repayments of indebtedness  issuances of additional partnership securities and cash reserves  each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to our unitholders 
our general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether an expenditure is for maintenance capital  which reduces operating surplus  or a capital improvement expenditure  which does not 
such determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders 
in some instances  our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions  even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make incentive distributions 
our general partner determines which costs  including allocated overhead  incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us 
our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf  and provides that reimbursement to loews for amounts allocable to us consistent with accounting and allocation methodologies generally permitted by ferc for rate making purposes and past business practices is deemed fair and reasonable to us 
our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates 
our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual obligations 
our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for us 
our general partner may exercise its rights to call and purchase all of our common units if  at any time  it and its affiliates own more than of the outstanding common units or all of our equity securities including common units  if it and its affiliates own more than in the aggregate of the outstanding common units and any other classes of equity securities and it receives an opinion of outside legal counsel to the effect that our being a pass through entity for tax purposes has or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the maximum applicable rates we can charge our customers 
our partnership agreement limits our general partner s fiduciary duties to unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law 
for example  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity  as opposed to its capacity as our general partner 
this entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires  and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of  or factors affecting us  our affiliates or any limited partner 
decisions made by our general partner in its individual capacity will be made by a majority of the owners of our general partner  and not by the board of directors of our general partner 
examples of these kinds of decisions include the exercise of its call rights  its voting rights with respect to the units it owns and its registration rights and the determination of whether to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership  provides that our general partner shall not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as general partner so long as it acted in good faith  meaning it believed that the decisions were in the best interests of the partnership  generally provides that affiliate transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be fair and reasonable to us and that  in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable  our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved  including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us  and provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us  our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct 
we have a holding company structure in which our subsidiaries conduct our operations and own our operating assets  which may affect our ability to make distributions 
we are a partnership holding company and our operating subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets 
we have no significant assets other than the ownership interests in our subsidiaries 
as a result  our ability to make distributions to our unitholders depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us 
the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by  among other things  the provisions of existing and future indebtedness  applicable state partnership and limited liability company laws and other laws and regulations  including ferc policies 
tax risks our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service irs were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or if we were to become subject to additional amounts of entity level taxation for state tax purposes  then our cash distributions to our unitholders could be substantially reduced 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under delaware law  it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of  and would likely pay additional state income tax at varying rates 
distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses  deductions or credits would flow through to our unitholders 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced 
thus  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flows and after tax return to our unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units 
current tax law may change  causing us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us to additional amounts of entity level taxation for state tax purposes 
for example  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
imposition of such a tax on us would reduce the cash available for distribution to unitholders 
our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to a material amount of entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units is subject to potential legislative  judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations  possibly on a retroactive basis 
the present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships  including us  or an investment in our common units may be modified by legislative  judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations at any time 
any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively 
recently  members of congress have considered substantive changes to the existing us tax laws that would affect certain publicly traded partnerships 
although it does not appear that the legislation considered would have affected our tax treatment as a partnership  we are unable to predict whether any of these changes  or other proposals  will be reconsidered or will ultimately be enacted 
any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units 
if the irs contests the federal income tax positions we take  the market for our common units may be adversely impacted  and the costs of any contest will reduce our cash distributions to our unitholders 
we have not requested any ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions that we take 
therefore  it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take and even then a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  because the costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner  any such contest will result in a reduction in cash available for distribution 
our unitholders may be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if such unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us 
our unitholders will be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income and who will be required to pay federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income  whether or not such unitholders receive cash distributions from us 
our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to such unitholders share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from such unitholders share of our taxable income 
tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be different than expected 
if our unitholders sell their common units  such unitholders will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and such unitholders tax basis in those common units 
distributions in excess of our unitholders allocable share of our net taxable income decrease their tax basis in their common units 
accordingly  to the extent a unitholder s distributions have exceeded such unitholder s allocable share of our net taxable income  the sale of units by such unitholder will produce taxable income to them if they sell such units at a price greater than their tax basis in those units  even if the price they receive is less than their original cost 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing a gain  may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized includes a unitholder s share of our nonrecourse liabilities  if our unitholders sell their units  they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale 
tax exempt entities and non us persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts known as iras and non us persons  raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and could be taxable to them 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non us persons will be required to file us federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
if you are a tax exempt entity or a non us person  you should consult your tax advisor before investing in our common units 
we will treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could result in a decrease in the value of the common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could decrease the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from any sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations 
recently  however  the department of the treasury and the irs issued proposed treasury regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which a publicly traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders 
although existing publicly traded partnerships are entitled to rely on these proposed treasury regulations  they are not binding on the irs and are subject to change until final treasury regulations are issued 
a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units 
if so  the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units  the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units 
we have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
when we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions  we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  under our valuation methods  subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their internal revenue code section b adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our valuation methods  or our allocation of the section b adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets  and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profit interests during any twelve month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve month period 
for purposes of determining whether the threshold has been met  multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders  which would result in our filing two tax returns for one fiscal year  and may result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year  the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination 
our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  but it would result in our being treated as a new partnership for tax purposes 
if we were treated as a new partnership  we would be required to make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we were unable to determine that a termination occurred 
our unitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements as a result of investing in our common units 
in addition to federal income taxes  unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  including state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future  even if our unitholders do not reside in any of those jurisdictions 
our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions 
further  unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we conduct business in twelve states 
we may own property or conduct business in other states or foreign countries in the future 
it is our unitholders responsibility to file all federal  state and local tax returns

our cash distribution policy our cash distribution policy is consistent with the terms of our partnership agreement which requires us to distribute our available cash  as that term is defined in our partnership agreement  on a quarterly basis 
however  there is no guarantee that unitholders will receive quarterly distributions from us 
our distribution policy may be changed at any time and is subject to certain restrictions or limitations  including  among others  our general partner s broad discretion to establish reserves which could reduce cash available for distributions  ferc regulations which place restrictions on various types of cash management programs employed by companies in the energy industry  including our operating subsidiaries  the requirements of applicable state partnership and limited liability company laws  and the requirements of our revolving credit facility which would prohibit us from making distributions to unitholders if an event of default were to occur 
in addition  we may lack sufficient cash to pay distributions to unitholders due to a number of factors  including those described in item a  risk factors  of this report 
incentive distribution rights idrs represent a limited partner ownership interest and include the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the target distribution levels have been achieved  as defined in our partnership agreement

item selected financial data the following table presents summary historical financial and operating data for us and our predecessor boardwalk pipelines  as of the dates and for the periods indicated 
in connection with the consummation of our initial public offering ipo  bphc contributed all of the equity interests in boardwalk pipelines to us 
this contribution was accounted for as a transfer of assets between entities under common control 
therefore  the results of boardwalk pipelines prior to november   have been combined with our results subsequent to november   as our consolidated results for prior to its converting to a limited partnership on november   boardwalk pipelines taxable income was included in the consolidated federal income tax return of loews and boardwalk pipelines recorded a charge in lieu of income taxes pursuant to a tax sharing agreement with loews 
the tax sharing agreement required boardwalk pipelines to remit to loews on a quarterly basis any federal income taxes as if it were filing a separate return 
boardwalk pipelines and its subsidiaries were also included in the state franchise tax filings of bphc 
the franchise taxes were charged to  and recorded by  boardwalk pipelines and its subsidiaries pursuant to the companies tax sharing policy 
following our ipo  we no longer record certain state franchise taxes incurred by bphc and no longer participate in a tax sharing agreement with loews 
our subsidiaries directly incur some income based state taxes  which are shown as income taxes on the consolidated statements of income 
as used herein  ebitda means earnings before interest  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization 
this measure is not calculated or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
we explain this measure below and reconcile it to its most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in non gaap financial measure below 
the financial data below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report in millions  except net income per common unit  net income per subordinated unit  net income per class b unit  distributions per common unit and distributions per class b unit boardwalk pipeline partners  lp for the year ended december  total operating revenues net income total assets long term debt net income per common unit net income per subordinated unit net income per class b unit distributions per common unit distributions per class b unit ebitda in the first quarter  we changed the method used in computing our net income per unit due to changes in gaap 
net income per unit has been retrospectively adjusted for all prior periods presented 
note in item contains further information 
for purposes of calculating net income per unit  net income for the current period is reduced by the amount of available cash that will be distributed with respect to that period 
any residual amount representing undistributed net income or loss is assumed to be allocated to the various ownership interests in accordance with the contractual provisions of the partnership agreement 
under our partnership agreement  for any quarterly period  the idrs participate in net income only to the extent of the amount of cash distributions actually declared  thereby excluding the idrs from participating in undistributed net income or losses 
accordingly  undistributed net income is assumed to be allocated to the other ownership interests on a pro rata basis  except that the class b units participation in net income is limited to per unit per quarter 
payments made on account of our various ownership interests are determined in relation to actual declared distributions and are not based on the assumed allocations required under gaap 
in june  we issued and sold approximately million class b units

overview through our operating subsidiaries  gulf crossing  gulf south and texas gas  we own and operate three interstate natural gas pipeline systems including integrated storage facilities 
our pipeline systems originate in the gulf coast region including oklahoma and arkansas  and extend northeasterly to the midwestern states of tennessee  kentucky  illinois  indiana and ohio 
our pipeline systems contain approximately  miles of interconnected pipeline  directly serving customers in twelve states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern us through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines 
in  our pipeline systems transported approximately tcf of gas resulting in average daily throughput of approximately bcf 
our natural gas storage facilities are comprised of eleven underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately bcf 
we conduct all of our natural gas transportation and integrated storage operations through our operating subsidiaries operating as one segment 
our transportation services consist of firm transportation  whereby the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at certain receipt and delivery points along our pipeline systems  plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported  and interruptible transportation  whereby the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used 
we offer firm storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity  including injection and withdrawal rights  and interruptible storage and pal services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used 
some pal agreements are paid for at inception of the service and revenues for these agreements are recognized as service is provided over the term of the agreement 
for the year ended december   the percentage of our total operating revenues associated with firm contracts was approximately 
we are not in the business of buying and selling natural gas other than for system management purposes  but changes in the price of natural gas can affect the overall supply and demand of natural gas  which in turn can affect our results of operations 
our business is affected by trends involving natural gas price levels and natural gas price spreads  including spreads between physical locations on our pipeline system  which affect our transportation revenues  and spreads in natural gas prices across time for example summer to winter  which primarily affect our storage and pal revenues 
factors that impact our results of operations a significant portion of our operating revenues is derived from reservation charges under multi year firm contracts 
for the year ended december   of our operating revenues were associated with reservation charges under firm contracts which do not vary based on capacity utilization 
as of december   the weighted average contract life of our contracts was approximately years 
our business can be impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics  the mix of services requested by customers and by competition and regulatory requirements  particularly when accompanied by downturns or sluggishness in the economy  especially over a longer term 
competition and contract renewals we compete with numerous interstate and intrastate pipelines throughout our service territory to provide transportation and storage services for our customers 
competition is particularly strong in the midwest and gulf coast states where we compete with numerous existing pipelines  including the rockies express pipeline that transports natural gas from northern colorado to eastern ohio and the mid continent express pipeline that transports gas from oklahoma and texas to alabama 
we will also directly compete with several new pipeline projects that are proposed or under development  including projects originating in the haynesville shale area more specifically  the tiger pipeline that will transport gas to perryville  louisiana and the haynesville extension pipeline that will transport gas to the industrial complex in southeastern louisiana and the fayetteville express pipeline which will originate in the fayetteville shale area and continue eastward to mississippi 
for new growth and expansion projects  we compete with other pipelines for contracts mainly with producers that would support such projects in order to transport their gas to market areas 
we also compete for renewals of expiring transportation and storage contracts 
despite these competitive conditions  assuming that customers use all of their reserved capacity  substantially all of our operating capacity is contracted for under long term firm agreements having a weighted average remaining life of approximately years 
in  firm contracts representing approximately million of annual reservation charges are due to expire  of which approximately million has been recontracted as of the filing date of this form k 
in  we were successful in renewing and remarketing firm contracts representing approximately million of annual reservation charges that were due to expire during that year  in many cases obtaining favorable rates and extended contract terms 
our ability to remarket available capacity will be impacted by competition from other pipelines  natural gas price volatility  the price differential between locations on our pipeline systems  the economic slowdown and numerous other factors beyond our control 
item a  risk factors contains more information regarding the risks related to competition in our industry 
natural gas prices many of our producer customers have been negatively impacted by recent declines in natural gas prices which although remaining elevated from historical levels  have decreased substantially from the peak levels reached during the summer of this decline in prices has caused several of our producer customers to announce plans to decrease drilling levels and  in some cases  to consider shutting in natural gas production from some producing wells  which could adversely affect the volumes of natural gas we transport 
the majority of our revenues are derived from capacity reservation charges that are not impacted by the volume of natural gas transported however smaller portions of our revenues are derived from charges based on actual volumes transported under firm and interruptible services 
for example  in approximately of our revenues were derived from charges based on actual volumes transported 
lower volumes of natural gas transported would result in lower revenues from natural gas transportation operations 
based on the significant level of revenue we receive from reservation capacity charges under long term contracts and our review of the recent announcements of drilling plans by our customers  we do not expect the current level of natural gas prices to have a significant adverse effect on our operating results 
however  we cannot give assurances that this will be the case  or that commodity prices will not decline further  which could result in a further reduction in drilling activities by our producer customers 
in addition  spreads in natural gas prices between time periods  such as winter to summer  impact our pal and interruptible storage revenues 
these period to period price spreads were favorable in resulting in an increase in pal and interruptible storage revenues as compared with the and periods 
we cannot predict future time period spreads or basis differentials 
ferc regulation we are subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates we can charge for our transportation and storage operations 
for our cost based services  ferc establishes both the maximum and minimum rates we can charge 
the basic elements that ferc considers are the cost of providing the service  the volumes of gas being transported  how costs are allocated between services  the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn 
while neither gulf south nor texas gas has an obligation to file a rate case  our gulf crossing pipeline has an obligation to file either a rate case or a cost and revenue study by the end of the first quarter to justify its rates 
customers of our subsidiaries or ferc can challenge the existing rates on any of our pipelines 
ferc recently initiated such a challenge on three non affiliated pipelines 
such a challenge could adversely affect our ability to establish reasonable transportation rates  to charge rates that would cover future increases in our costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain our current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return 
additionally  ferc can propose changes or modifications to any of its existing rate related policies expansion and growth projects an abundance of recent natural gas supply discoveries in the bossier sands  barnett shale  haynesville shale  fayetteville shale and caney woodford shale producing regions has formed the basis for the recent expansion of our pipeline system 
we recently added approximately  miles of pipeline to our existing systems by completing the following projects the east texas pipeline  the southeast expansion  the gulf crossing project and the fayetteville and greenville laterals 
remediation of pipe anomalies for our east texas pipeline  southeast expansion  gulf crossing pipeline and the fayetteville lateral  we have entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers which would utilize the maximum capacity available from operating at higher than normal operating pressures up to of the pipe s smys  which increases the peak day transmission capacity of the pipeline as opposed to the normal operating pressure of up to smys 
phmsa retains discretion as to whether to grant  or to maintain  the authority to operate a pipeline at higher than normal operating pressures 
absent the receipt and maintenance of authority from phmsa to operate at higher than normal operating pressures  we would not be able to transport all of the contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipelines 
while completing the requirements to operate our east texas pipeline  southeast expansion  gulf crossing pipeline and the fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures  we discovered anomalies in certain pipeline segments on each of the projects 
accordingly  we reduced the operating pressures on each pipeline below normal operating pressures as we performed additional testing procedures  remediated the anomalies and continued to seek authority from phmsa to increase operating pressures  first to normal operating pressures and subsequently to higher than normal operating pressures under the special permits 
we also shut down pipeline segments for periods of time to remediate anomalies 
the pressure reductions and shutdowns that were undertaken to remediate anomalies on our expansion pipeline projects reduced throughput and adversely impacted our transportation revenues  net income and cash flows during at the same time  our operating costs and expenses  particularly depreciation and property taxes  increased in due to costs associated with the expansion project pipelines being placed into service 
see results of operations for more information on the impacts of the pipeline pressure reductions and shutdowns on our income 
in december  we received authority from phmsa to operate our east texas pipeline  southeast expansion and gulf crossing project inch pipeline expansion projects under special permits that would allow each of these pipelines to operate at higher than normal operating pressures 
we continue to work with phmsa to obtain the authority to operate our fayetteville lateral at the higher than normal operating pressures 
unless we obtain phmsa s consent to increase operating pressures for the fayetteville lateral to higher than normal levels under the special permit  our transportation revenues would not grow to the extent we had originally expected  beginning in mid  as the volume commitments on the fayetteville lateral under our existing firm contracts increase 
absent authority to operate the fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures  we could also incur additional costs for system upgrades on that project to increase capacity to meet contracted volume commitments 
see item a  risk factors we need to obtain and maintain authority from phmsa to operate at higher than normal operating pressures for related information 
expansion and growth project status set forth below is information with respect to the status of each of our expansion and growth projects 
east texas pipeline 
portions of this pipeline were shut down for periods of time in may and july  during which time we completed the requisite anomaly remediation 
in december  we received authority from phmsa to operate the east texas pipeline at higher than normal operating pressures  which provides a peak day transmission capacity of bcf per day 
upon the completion of our haynesville project described below  the peak day transmission capacity of this pipeline is expected to be bcf per day 
southeast expansion 
portions of this pipeline were shut down for periods of time in may and july  during which time we completed the requisite anomaly remediation 
in december  we received authority from phmsa to operate the southeast expansion pipeline at higher than normal operating pressures  which provides a designated peak day transmission capacity of bcf per day 
gulf crossing project 
the gulf crossing project was shut down the entire month of june  during which time we completed the requisite anomaly remediation 
in december  we received authority from phmsa to operate the gulf crossing project pipeline at higher than normal operating pressures  which provides a peak day transmission capacity of bcf per day 
we expect to increase the peak day transmission capacity of this pipeline to approximately bcf per day  by adding compression in the first quarter  which has been approved by the ferc 
fayetteville and greenville laterals 
during the third quarter  the initial testing of the fayetteville and greenville laterals was completed and it was determined that approximately of the pipeline joints contained anomalies 
in september and october  portions of the fayetteville and greenville laterals were shut down in order to remediate anomalies 
effective october   we received authority from phmsa to operate the fayetteville and greenville laterals at normal operating pressures  which has enabled us to meet our current contractual obligations of approximately bcf per day for the fayetteville lateral and bcf per day for the greenville lateral 
we continue to seek authority to operate our fayetteville lateral at the higher than normal operating pressures 
until we have obtained phmsa s consent to increase operating pressures to higher than normal levels under the special permit  we will not be able to operate that pipeline at its anticipated peak day transmission capacity as contracted volumes increase in the future 
our greenville lateral was constructed to operate at normal operating pressures and we are not seeking the authority to operate that pipeline at higher than normal operating pressures under a special permit 
in january  we added compression facilities that increased peak day delivery capacity to approximately bcf per day on the greenville lateral and approximately bcf per day on the fayetteville lateral 
the designed peak day delivery capacity of the fayetteville lateral is approximately bcf per day once the authority to operate our fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures is received from phmsa or we complete other system upgrades on that project 
the increase in capacity to bcf per day will be needed to meet contractual commitments that will be in effect in mid haynesville project 
the haynesville project consists of adding compression to our east texas pipeline in louisiana  which will add approximately bcf per day of peak day transmission capacity with delivery capabilities from the desoto  louisiana  area to the perryville  louisiana  area 
we recently received ferc approval for this expansion  which we anticipate will be in service in late customers have contracted for substantially all of the capacity on this project at a weighted average contract life of approximately years 
clarence compression project 
the clarence compression project  which also targets production from the haynesville shale  will add approximately bcf per day of peak day transmission capacity 
this project will receive gas from the holly field area in northwest louisiana  and deliver to a point near olla  louisiana 
customers have contracted for approximately bcf per day of capacity with a weighted average contract life of approximately years 
the compression is expected to be in service in late  subject to ferc approval 
western kentucky storage expansion project 
we have completed phase iii of our western kentucky storage expansion project  which consisted of developing approximately bcf of new storage working gas capacity 
customers have contracted for all of the available capacity 
approximately bcf of capacity was placed into service in and we placed the remaining capacity into service in october the total capital cost of this project was approximately million 
financial analysis of operations we derive our revenues primarily from the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas for third parties 
transportation and storage services are provided under firm and interruptible service agreements 
our operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of gas transported  with the exception of fuel consumed at our compressor stations  which is included in fuel and gas transportation expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
the following analysis discusses our financial results of operations for the years  and compared with our net income for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  operating expenses for the year ended december   were higher than the comparable period in  mainly as a result of increases in depreciation and property taxes associated with our expansion projects 
the increase in expenses more than offset the increase in revenues from our expansion projects  which were approximately million lower than expected due to operating our expansion pipelines at reduced operating pressures and portions of the expansion pipelines being shut down for periods of time during  as discussed under expansion and growth projects 
the period was favorably impacted by million of gains from the disposition of coal reserves  gas sales associated with our storage expansion and the settlement of a contract claim 
operating revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  gas transportation revenues  excluding fuel  increased million  primarily from our expansion projects 
pal revenues increased million due to increased parking opportunities and favorable summer to summer natural gas price spreads 
the increases were partially offset by lower fuel revenues of million due to unfavorable natural gas prices 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary factors for the increases were higher depreciation and property taxes of million associated with a larger asset base from expansion 
operations and maintenance expenses increased approximately million primarily from increased maintenance projects and expansion related operations 
administrative and general expenses increased million mainly due to increases in employee benefits as a result of lower returns on trust assets for our pension and post retirement benefit plans and increases in unit based compensation from an increase in the price of our common units 
operations and maintenance expenses and losses on disposal of assets were million higher due to pipeline investigation and retirement costs related to the east texas pipeline 
fuel and gas transportation expenses decreased million primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices 
the period was favorably impacted by gains of million on the sale of gas related to our western kentucky storage expansion  million from the disposition of coal reserves  million from the settlement of a contract claim and million due to a change in employee paid time off policy which resulted in a reserve reversal 
total other deductions increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period 
the primary factor for the increase was higher interest expense of million resulting from lower capitalized interest associated with placing expansion projects in service and higher debt levels in compared with our net income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers for the increase were higher revenues from services associated with our expansion projects and gains from the disposition of coal reserves  gas sales associated with our storage expansion and the settlement of a contract claim 
the favorable drivers were partly offset by lower pal revenues due to unfavorable natural gas price spreads and higher depreciation and property tax expense due to an increase in our asset base from expansion 
the period was unfavorably impacted by a million impairment charge related to the magnolia storage facility 
operating revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  gas transportation revenues  excluding fuel  increased million  primarily from our expansion projects and higher no notice and interruptible services on our existing assets 
fuel revenues increased million due to expansion related throughput and higher natural gas prices 
gas storage revenues increased million related to an increase in storage capacity associated with our western kentucky storage expansion 
these increases were partially offset by lower pal revenues of million due to unfavorable natural gas price spreads 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers were increased depreciation and other taxes  comprised primarily of property taxes  of million associated with an increase in our asset base  increased fuel costs of million mainly from providing service on our expansion projects and higher natural gas prices and million of third party transportation costs associated with providing customers of our expansion projects access to off system markets 
administrative and general expenses increased million due to increased outside services mainly due to legal matters  information technology related expenses from infrastructure improvements  corporate services  higher property insurance from an increase in rates and asset base and a bad debt recovery that favorably impacted the period 
the increases to operating expenses were offset by gains of million from the disposition of coal reserves  million on the sale of gas related to our western kentucky storage expansion and million from the settlement of a contract claim 
additionally  in the fourth quarter  we changed our employee paid time off benefits  resulting in a reduction in operation and maintenance expenses of million and a reduction of administrative and general expenses of million 
the period was unfavorably impacted by a million impairment charge related to our magnolia storage project 
total other deductions increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period  primarily as a result of million of decreased interest income due to lower average cash balances available for investment  partly offset by a million reduction in interest expense from higher capitalized interest associated with our expansion projects 
liquidity and capital resources we are a partnership holding company and derive all of our operating cash flow from our operating subsidiaries 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities  our revolving credit facility  debt issuances and sales of limited partner units 
our operating subsidiaries use funds from their respective operations to fund their operating activities and maintenance capital expenditures  service their indebtedness and make advances or distributions to boardwalk pipelines 
boardwalk pipelines uses cash provided from the operating subsidiaries and  as needed  borrowings under its revolving credit facility discussed below  to service its outstanding indebtedness and  when available  make distributions or advances to us to fund our distributions to unitholders 
we have no guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties 
our operating subsidiaries participate in an intercompany cash management program to the extent they are permitted under ferc regulations 
under the cash management program  depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short term cash surpluses or cash requirements  boardwalk pipelines either provides cash to them or they provide cash to boardwalk pipelines 
in the past two years  the capital markets have been impacted by global liquidity  credit and recessionary concerns 
during this period  we have continued to have access to our credit facility to fund our short term liquidity needs 
in addition  we have issued common units and class b units  received additional contributions from our general partner and received net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
see discussion below under equity and debt financing 
our ability to continue to access the capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on our financial condition  credit ratings and market conditions 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  ability to obtain financing and cash flow generated from future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations and our planned operations  including our capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and we expect to fund our maintenance capital expenditures of approximately million from our operating cash flows 
expansion and growth capital expenditures the following table presents our estimate of total capital expenditures and the amounts invested through december   for our remaining pipeline expansion projects  including expenditures for pipe remediation and our growth projects in millions estimated total capital expenditures cash invested through december  southeast expansion gulf crossing project fayetteville and greenville laterals pipe remediation haynesville project clarence compression total our estimated total capital expenditures are based on internally developed financial models and timelines 
factors in the estimates include  but are not limited to  those related to pipeline costs based on mileage  size and type of pipe  materials and construction and engineering costs 
this estimate represents the cost of remediating pipe anomalies on our east texas pipeline  our southeast expansion  our gulf crossing project and our fayetteville and greenville laterals 
in our efforts to obtain the authority from phmsa to operate our east texas pipeline  southeast expansion  gulf crossing project and fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures  we have incurred costs to remediate pipeline anomalies as described under expansion and growth capital expenditures 
we continue to seek authority to operate our fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures and may incur additional costs to inspect  test and remediate pipe segments on the fayetteville lateral in order to obtain from phmsa the authority to increase operating pressures to higher than normal levels under the special permit 
we expect to incur up to million in capital expenditures to complete our expansion and growth projects  including pipe remediation efforts for the fayetteville lateral  for which the majority of expenditures are expected to occur by the end of as discussed in remediation of pipe anomalies  absent authority to operate the fayetteville lateral at higher than normal operating pressures  we could incur additional costs for other system upgrades on that project to increase capacity to meet contracted volume commitments 
including costs associated with remediating the pipe anomalies and additional cost that we could incur on our fayetteville lateral  we expect the total cost to complete our expansion projects to be within our previously announced cost estimates 
our cost and timing estimates for these projects are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties as discussed in item a  risk factors of this report 
equity and debt financing we have financed our expansion capital expenditures through the issuance of equity and debt  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available operating cash flows in excess of our operating needs 
we do not anticipate the need to raise further capital in order to complete our expansion and growth projects 
in  we received net cash proceeds of approximately million from the following equity and debt issuances which proceeds were used to directly and indirectly fund our expansion projects through the reduction of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and  in the case of the debt securities  to reduce borrowings under our subordinated loan agreement by million in millions  except issue price month of issuance net cash proceeds received number of units issue price type of issuance august public offering of common units august n a n a public offering of debt securities june private placement of common units to bphc may n a n a subordinated loan with bphc includes a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
includes a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding each of these offerings 
we have also borrowed under our revolving credit facility to finance our expansion projects 
as of december   approximately million of our long term debt  including million borrowed under our revolving credit facility  matures in the term of the revolving credit facility may be extended to as described under revolving credit facility 
we expect to refinance the debt through the issuance and sale of new debt 
revolving credit facility we maintain a revolving credit facility which has aggregate lending commitments of billion  under which boardwalk pipelines  gulf south and texas gas each may borrow funds  up to applicable sub limits 
a financial institution which has a million commitment under the revolving credit facility filed for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter and has not funded its portion of our borrowing requests since that time 
interest on amounts drawn under the credit facility is payable at a floating rate equal to an applicable spread per annum over the london interbank offered rate or a base rate defined as the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the revolving credit facility has a maturity date of june   however  all outstanding revolving loans on such date may be converted to term loans having a maturity date of june  as of december   we had million of loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate on the borrowings of and had no letters of credit issued 
subsequent to december   we borrowed an additional million  which increased borrowings to million 
we and our subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenant requirements under our credit facility at december  note in item of this report contains more information regarding our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants  including  among others  limitations on the payment of cash dividends and other restricted payments  the incurrence of additional debt  sale leaseback transactions and transactions with our affiliates 
the facility also contains a financial covenant that requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement  measured for the preceding twelve months  of not more than five to one 
although we do not believe that these covenants have had  or will have  a material impact on our business and financing activities or our ability to obtain the financing to maintain operations and continue our capital investments  they could restrict us in some circumstances as stated in item a  risk factors 
in particular  maintaining compliance with the financial covenant may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness to finance our growth projects  which could limit our growth opportunities or require the issuance of more equity securities by us than previously anticipated 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes significant contractual cash payment obligations under firm commitments as of december   by period in millions total less than year years years more than years principal payments on long term debt interest on long term debt capital commitments pipeline capacity agreements operating lease commitments total this includes our senior unsecured notes  having maturity dates from to  million of loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility  having a maturity date of june   and our subordinated loans  which mature initially on december  the revolving credit facility and subordinated loans are extendable by us on the same terms for an additional year 
interest obligations represent interest due on our senior unsecured notes at fixed rates 
future interest obligations under our revolving credit facility are uncertain  due to the variable interest rate and fluctuating balances 
based on a weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december   million and million would be due under the credit facility in less than one year and years 
capital commitments represent binding commitments under purchase orders for materials ordered but not received and firm commitments under binding construction service agreements existing at december  the amounts shown do not reflect commitments we have made after december  for information on these projects  see expansion and growth capital expenditures 
the amounts shown are associated with various pipeline capacity agreements on third party pipelines that allow our operating subsidiaries to transport gas to off system markets on behalf of our customers 
pursuant to the settlement of the texas gas rate case in  we are required to annually fund an amount to the texas gas pension plan equal to the amount of actuarially determined net periodic pension cost  including a minimum of million 
in  we expect to fund approximately million to the texas gas pension plan 
distributions for the twelve months ended december  and  we paid distributions of million and million to our various ownership interests 
note in item of this report contains further discussion regarding our distributions 
changes in cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period  primarily from prepayments received under pal arrangements in the period and the settlement of derivatives in the period 
changes in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased  million to million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the comparable period  primarily due to a  million decrease in capital expenditures mainly related to our expansion projects and the sale of million of short term investments 
changes in cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased  million to million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the comparable period 
these decreases resulted from a  million reduction in proceeds from the issuance and sale of equity  including related general partner contributions  an million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of debt and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility and a million increase in distributions to our partners 
impact of inflation we have experienced increased costs in recent years due to the effect of inflation on the cost of labor  benefits  materials and supplies  and property  plant and equipment ppe 
a portion of the increased labor and materials and supplies costs have directly affected income through increased operating costs and depreciation expense 
the cumulative impact of inflation over a number of years has resulted in increased costs for current replacement of productive facilities 
the majority of our ppe and materials and supplies is subject to rate making treatment  and under current ferc practices  recovery is limited to historical costs 
amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable unless a rate case is filed 
however  cost based regulation  along with competition and other market factors  may limit our ability to price jurisdictional services to ensure recovery of inflation s effect on costs 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no guarantees of off balance sheet debt to third parties  no debt obligations that contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligations in the event of specified levels of declines in credit ratings  and no other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods we consider reasonable 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
regulation pursuant to ferc regulations certain revenues that we collect may be subject to possible refunds to our customers 
accordingly  during an open rate case  estimates of rate refund reserves are recorded based on regulatory proceedings  advice of counsel and estimated risk adjusted total exposure  as well as other factors 
at december  and  there were no liabilities for any open rate case recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
currently  neither gulf south nor texas gas is involved in an open general rate case  however gulf crossing will either have to file a rate case or justify its initial firm transportation rates by the end of the first quarter our subsidiaries are regulated by ferc 
when certain criteria are met  gaap requires that certain rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates regulatory accounting 
this basis of accounting is applicable to operations of our texas gas subsidiary which record certain costs and benefits as regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future periods  but is not applicable to operations associated with the texas gas fayetteville and greenville laterals project due to rates charged under negotiated rate agreements and phase iii of the western kentucky storage expansion project due to the regulatory treatment and contractual rates associated with that project 
regulatory accounting is not applicable to gulf crossing due to discounts under negotiated rate agreements  or gulf south because competition in the market areas of gulf south has resulted in discounts from the maximum allowable cost based rates being granted to customers and certain services provided by gulf south are priced using market based rates 
we monitor the regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate to determine that any regulatory assets continue to be probable of recovery 
if we were to determine that all or a portion of our regulatory assets no longer met the criteria for recognition as regulatory assets  that portion which was not recoverable would be written off  net of any regulatory liabilities 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our regulatory assets and liabilities 
in the course of providing transportation and storage services to customers  the pipelines may receive different quantities of gas from shippers and operators than the quantities delivered by the pipelines on behalf of those shippers and operators 
this results in transportation and exchange gas receivables and payables  commonly known as imbalances  which are primarily settled through the receipt or delivery of gas in the future or with cash 
settlement of imbalances requires agreement between the pipelines and shippers or operators as to allocations of volumes to specific transportation contracts and timing of delivery of gas based on operational conditions 
the receivables and payables are valued at market price for operations where regulatory accounting is not applicable and are valued at the historical value of gas in storage for operations where regulatory accounting is applicable  consistent with the regulatory treatment and the settlement history 
fair value measurements fair value refers to an exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal market in which the reporting entity transacts based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming its highest and best use 
a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions giving priority  from highest to lowest  to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level  observable inputs not included in level  for example  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities level  and unobservable data level  for example  a reporting entity s own internal data based on the best information available in the circumstances 
we have included fair value measurements in our disclosures regarding the fair value of our debt and the trust assets associated with our pension and postretirement benefits plans  as well as to determine the fair value of texas gas for purposes of completing our annual impairment test for goodwill 
the amounts disclosed for the fair value of our debt and benefit plan trust assets were based on quoted market prices for those assets or similar assets  however approximately million of the benefits plan trust assets were based on unobservable data inputs 
the fair value measurement associated with our annual goodwill impairment test was derived based on our assumptions we believe market participants would use in pricing the reporting unit  including the use of a discounted cash flow model  which are generally unobservable data inputs under the fair value hierarchy 
please refer to goodwill for more information regarding the annual test and judgments and assumptions used in completing the test 
our consolidated financial statements include fair value measurements related to derivatives 
at december   the fair value of our derivatives was determined based on quoted market prices for similar contracts 
notes  and to our consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report contain more information regarding our fair value measurements 
environmental liabilities our environmental liabilities are based on management s best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation for probable costs associated with environmental assessment and remediation of our operating sites 
these estimates are based on evaluations and discussions with counsel and operating personnel and the current facts and circumstances related to these environmental matters 
at december   we had accrued approximately million for environmental matters 
our environmental accrued liabilities could change substantially in the future due to factors such as the nature and extent of any contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  and the involvement of and direction taken by the epa  ferc and other governmental authorities on these matters 
we continue to conduct environmental assessments and are implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the total estimated environmental costs 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of long lived assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
this evaluation is based on undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be realized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted sum of cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
while we were developing a salt dome storage cavern near napoleonville  louisiana  integrity tests completed in indicated that due to geological and other anomalies that could not be corrected  we would be unable to place the cavern in service as expected 
we elected to abandon that cavern and began exploring the possibility of securing a new site on which a new cavern could be developed 
the carrying value of the cavern and related facilities was tested for recoverability  and in we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million  representing the carrying value of the cavern  the fair value of which was determined to be zero based on discounted expected future cash flows 
we expect to use the other assets associated with the project  which includes pipeline  compressors  and other equipment and facilities  in conjunction with a replacement storage cavern to be developed 
if we determine in the future that the assets cannot be used in conjunction with a new cavern or a new cavern cannot be secured in the same area  we may be required to record an additional impairment charge at the time that determination is made 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill recorded as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets which was initially recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of texas gas 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we perform this test annually at december beginning in  we were required to determine the reporting unit s fair value in accordance with accounting requirements involving fair value measurements as described under fair value measurements 
the fair value measurement was derived based on assumptions we believe market participants would use in pricing the reporting unit  which are generally unobservable data inputs under the fair value hierarchy 
these judgments and assumptions include the valuation premise  the use of a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value  and the inputs to the valuation model  including our five year financial plan operating results  the long term outlook for growth in natural gas demand in the us and measures of the risk free rate  equity premium and systematic risk used in the calculation of the applied discount rate under the capital asset pricing model 
the resulting estimate of fair value was compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount at december   and accordingly no impairment was recognized 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could substantially change the fair value determined during the annual test and potentially result in the recognition of an impairment charge in our financial statements 
defined benefit plans we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors in the us such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies  as well as our policies regarding management of the plans such as the allocation of plan assets among investment options 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilize current market information and liability information provided by our plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the moody s aa corporate bond index is consistently used as the basis for the change in discount rate from the last measurement date with this measure confirmed by the yield on other broad bond indices 
additionally  we supplement our discount rate decision with a yield curve analysis 
the yield curve is applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans 
the yield curve is developed by the plans actuaries and is a hypothetical aa aa yield curve represented by a series of annualized discount rates reflecting bond issues having a rating of aa or better by moody s investors service  inc or a rating of aa or better by standard poor s

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk with the exception of our revolving credit facility  for which the interest rate is periodically reset  our debt has been issued at fixed rates 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the debt instruments but do not directly affect earnings or cash flows 
the following table presents market risk associated with our fixed rate long term debt  including our subordinated loans  at december in millions  except interest rates carrying value of fixed rate debt fair value of fixed rate debt basis point increase in interest rates and resulting debt decrease basis point decrease in interest rates and resulting debt increase weighted average interest rate at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement at a weighted average interest rate of which rate is reset periodically 
a increase in interest rates would increase our cash payments for interest on the credit facility by million on an annual basis 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
at december  and  million and million of our undistributed cash  shown on the balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents  was primarily invested in treasury fund accounts and at december   million was invested in us treasury notes under repurchase agreements and shown as short term investments 
due to the short term nature of the treasury fund accounts  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
commodity risk certain volumes of our gas stored underground are available for sale and subject to commodity price risk 
at december  and  approximately million and million of gas stored underground  which we own and carry as current gas stored underground  was available for sale and exposed to commodity price risk 
additionally  bcf of gas with a book value of million has become available for sale as a result of phase iii of the western kentucky storage expansion 
we utilize derivatives to hedge certain exposures to market price fluctuations on the anticipated operational sales of gas 
our pipelines do not take title to the natural gas which they transport and store in rendering traditional firm and interruptible transportation and storage services  therefore they do not assume the related natural gas commodity price risk associated with that gas 
the derivatives related to the sale of natural gas and cash for fuel reimbursement where customers make a cash payment for the estimated cost of fuel used in providing transportation services as opposed to providing quantities of natural gas  generally qualify for cash flow hedge accounting and are designated as such 
the effective component of related gains and losses resulting from changes in fair values of the derivatives contracts designated as cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
the deferred gains and losses are recognized in earnings when the anticipated transactions affect earnings 
generally  for gas sales and retained fuel  any gains and losses on the related derivatives would be recognized in operating revenues 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk relating to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
we have established credit policies in the pipeline tariffs which are intended to minimize credit risk in accordance with ferc policies and actively monitor this portion of our business 
our credit exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by us to them  generally under pal and no notice services 
natural gas price volatility can materially increase credit risk related to gas loaned to customers 
if any significant customer of ours should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas they owe to us  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately trillion british thermal units tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per million british thermal unit mmbtu  the market value of this gas at december   would have been approximately million 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per mmbtu  the market value of this gas at december   would have been approximately million 
although nearly all of our customers pay for our services on a timely basis  we actively monitor the credit exposure to our customers 
we include in our ongoing assessments amounts due pursuant to services we render plus the value of any gas we have lent to a customer through no notice or pal services and the value of gas due to us under a transportation imbalance 
our pipeline tariffs contain language that allow us to require a customer that does not meet certain credit criteria to provide cash collateral  post a letter of credit or provide a guarantee from a credit worthy entity in an amount equaling up to three months of capacity reservation charges 
for certain agreements  we have included contractual provisions that require additional credit support should the credit ratings of those customers fall below investment grade 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time our existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to termination or renegotiation 
in addition  we have market risk exposure if one of our transportation or storage customers defaults on a service agreement and we are unable to resell the capacity at the same or higher rate 
as a result of competition in the industry  we actively monitor future expiration dates associated with our contract portfolio 
as of december   approximately of the firm contract load on our pipeline systems was due to expire on or before december  as of december   the firm contract load due to expire within one year was 
many of the contracts comprising the were renewed or remarketed at favorable pricing terms and for extended terms
