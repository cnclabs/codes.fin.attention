table of contents principally first defense to markets outside of the united states  we expect some sales volatility in those territories 
for example  foreign sales in decreased by in comparison to the level of foreign sales was higher than but lower than we believe that sales of our products were influenced by the price of milk  cows and calves and by the cost of feed as well as by the number of cows in the us dairy herd 
sales of first defense decreased by during the year ended december  in comparison to sales of first defense are normally seasonal  with higher sales expected during the first and fourth quarters and lower sales expected during the second and third quarters 
first defense continued to benefit in from wide acceptance by dairy and beef producers as an effective tool to prevent calf scours 
sales of wipe out dairy wipes decreased by during the year ended december  in comparison to we believe that sales growth potential for wipe out dairy wipes is limited because most of our sales of this product tend to be to smaller dairies that are under continued financial pressures that are forcing many small dairy producers out of business

the gross margin as a percentage of product sales was and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
this compares to gross margin percentages of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our current annual target is to maintain the gross margin percentage at around 
a number of factors account for the variability in our costs 
we expect some fluctuations in gross margin percentages from quarter to quarter 
the gross margin on first defense is affected by biological yields from our raw material  which do fluctuate over time 
more generally  we are beginning to experience higher costs for production of first defense and wipe out dairy wipes due to increased labor costs and expenses associated with our efforts to sustain compliance with cgmp regulations in our production 
table of contents processes 
like most manufacturers in the us  we have been experiencing increases in the cost of raw materials that we purchase 
product mix also affects gross margin in that we earn a higher gross margin on first defense and a lower gross margin on wipe out dairy wipes 
because first defense customers are price sensitive  we had held its selling price without significant increase for about seven years  believing that we could benefit more from higher unit sales volume than through a higher average selling price per unit 
however  during the first quarter of  we implemented a modest increase to the selling price of first defense reflecting a part of the increase we have experienced in our labor and raw material costs 
product development and licensing product development expenses decreased by  or  to  during the year ended december   as compared to  during product development expenses aggregated and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the majority of our product development budget from through has been focused on the development of mast out 
going forward  we expect to focus our internally funded product development expenses on mast out and other improvements  extensions or additions to our first defense product line and a sustained effort to maintain cgmp compliance in our manufacturing operations 
the other improvements  extensions  or additions to our current product line include the potential to prevent scours in calves caused by pathogens other than those within the current first defense disease claims e 
coli k and coronavirus such as rotavirus 
we also remain interested in acquiring other new products and technologies that fit with our sales focus on the dairy and beef industries 
administrative expenses administrative expenses decreased by approximately  or  to  during the year ended december  as compared to  during we strive to be efficient with these expenses while funding costs associated with complying with the sarbanes oxley act of and other costs associated with being a publicly held company

as we invest more to support first defense sales and begin to prepare for a market launch of mast out  we anticipate an increase in these expenses 
our objective in is to maintain the ratio of product selling expenses to product sales at approximately on an annual basis 
interest income interest income decreased by approximately  or  to  in in comparison to due principally to a decrease in interest rates and a reduction in funds invested during we have not incurred interest expense since we repaid our outstanding bank debt in may loss before income taxes and net loss our loss before income taxes of  during the year ended december  compares to a loss before income taxes of  during the year ended december  we recorded income tax benefits of and of the losses before income taxes during the years ended december  and  respectively

we continue to look for new product acquisition opportunities that would have a strategic fit with the products that we currently sell

capital investments of  were funded principally by cash and maturities of short term investments 
net working capital decreased by  or  to  at december  from  at december  total assets decreased by  or  to  at december  from  at december  we have no outstanding bank debt 
stockholders equity decreased by less than  or  to  at december  from  at december  as we implement process improvements  we are investing in personnel  equipment and facility improvements to increase the efficiency and quality of our operations 
in june  our board of directors authorized the investment of approximately  for facility modifications and more production equipment to increase our production capacity 
this authorization was in addition to  that was included in the original budget for fixed asset investments 
as of december   we had remaining board authorization to spend up to  under this capital expenditure budget net of the  and  we invested in capital expenditures during and  respectively 
we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our working capital requirements and to finance our ongoing business operations during at least the next twelve months 
the return of the mast out product rights to us has caused us to increase our spending on product development expenses that had been funded by pfizer from to mid as expected  the expenditures on this program of product development resulted in net losses in and ending the nine consecutive years of profitability that we recorded through the year ended december  continued development towards regulatory approval of mast out will likely result in a net loss in as well 
we believe that our current balance of cash and short term investments is more than sufficient to fund our projected loss 
we believe that the commercial prospects for mast out warrant this level of investment 
at this preliminary stage of our negotiations with a contract manufacturer  we are estimating that the investment required for full commercial manufacture of nisin for mast out for a possible product launch in will exceed our available cash 
we are exploring opportunities to finance a portion of this investment including partner  debt and equity funding 
since  our strategy has been focused on selling and developing products that improve animal health and productivity in the dairy and beef industries 
these product opportunities are generally less expensive to develop than the human health product opportunities that we had worked on during the s 
we funded most of our product development expenses principally from product sales and were profitable for each of the nine years in the period ended december  during the nine years of profitability from through  our cumulative investment in product development expenses of  was supported  in small part  by  in grant awards 
the investment of an additional  in product development expenses during and brings our cumulative investment to  during the eleven year period ended december  we may  on occasion  seek additional research grant support as a means of leveraging the funds that we are able to spend developing new products 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements none effects of inflation and interest rates  currency fluctuations we believe that neither inflation nor interest rates have had a significant effect on our revenues and expenses 
future increases in inflation or interest rates  however  could affect our customers and the demand for our products 
we hope to increase the level of our future sales of products outside the united states 
the cost of our products to foreign customers could be affected by currency fluctuations 
the decline of the us dollar against other currencies could make our products less expensive to foreign customers 
overall  however  we do not anticipate that currency fluctuations will significantly affect our sales or the cost of operations 
critical accounting policies details regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements are provided in note m to our financial statements 
the financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards that were effective and applicable to us as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  contingencies and the useful lives and carrying values of intangible and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have chosen to highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of the business and understanding our financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
requires that four criteria are met before revenue is recognized 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products  as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
royalty income is recorded on the accrual basis based on sales as reported to us by our licensee pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
all research and development costs and patent costs are expensed as incurred  except as described in the next paragraph 
in november  we capitalized the  payment we made to nutrition  inc to buy out certain future milestone and royalty payment obligations  which principally resulted in a fully paid  perpetual license related to mast out 
we deferred the revenue from the  in milestone payments that were received from pfizer from december to september in connection with a product development and marketing agreement covering mast out 
upon termination of this agreement in  we wrote off the remaining unamortized cost of technology rights and recognized the remaining deferred income from non refundable milestone payments 
this resulted in a net increase to income before income taxes of approximately  during the third quarter of inventories include raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are recorded at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on the first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
work in process and finished goods inventories include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead
