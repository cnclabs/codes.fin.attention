we made solid progress executing our long term growth strategy  which focuses on expanding our production capacity  building a well known brand  exploiting our sales capabilities by accessing more retail outlets and sales channels 
overview we are principally engaged in the meat and food processing and distribution business in the prc 
currently  we have processing plants located in henan  jilin and sichuan provinces and in tianjin in the prc 
our current total production capacity for chilled pork and frozen pork is approximately  metric tons per day  based on an eight hour working day  or approximately  metric tons on an annual basis 
we also have production capacity for prepared meats of approximately metric tons per eight hour day  or approximately  metric tons on an annual basis  and for fruits and vegetables of approximately metric tons per eight hour day  or approximately  metric tons on an annual basis 
we utilize state of the art equipment in all of our slaughterhouses and processing facilities 
the following table shows  as of march   the annual production capacity of our processing plants based on an eight hour working day 
annual capacity product location in metric tons chilled and frozen pork changge  henan province gongzhulin  jilin province deyang  sichuan province zhumadian  henan province anyang  henan province luoyang  henan province tianjin yongcheng  henan province prepared meat changge  henan province fruits and vegetables changge  henan province we believe we must continue to expand our production capacity to seize additional market share 
as a result  we are currently constructing  or plan to construct  additional production facilities in different parts of china 
in january  we placed into operation a chilled and frozen pork facility in tianjin with annual production capacity of approximately  metric tons 
we are investing approximately million to build a production facility in changge city  henan province 
this facility is being designed with a production capacity of  metric tons for food oil pork oil 
we expect to put the new facility into operation by april we also plan to invest approximately million to build a production facility for prepared foods in tianjin 
this facility is being designed with a production capacity of  metric tons for prepared foods 
we expect to put this facility into operation in october we believe these plants will enable us to achieve synergies in certain areas  including the purchase of raw materials  logistics and marketing 
to further expand our business and to upgrade the zhongpin brand from a regional brand to a national brand  we intend to expand our production into other provinces in which pork is traditionally consumed in significant quantities and in which there is a sufficient hog supply 
in an effort to minimize our risk and the potential of losses when expanding into new markets  we have entered certain markets by leasing  rather than purchasing or constructing  our production facilities because we believe that  even after conducting comprehensive market research and professional due diligence  there is significant risk that a market will not generate the level of sales we expect 
in the future  we would like to replicate our success in henan province in other provinces in northern and eastern china where we would like to build capacity clusters similar to the cluster we constructed in henan province 
we intend to lease  acquire or build new facilities to support the development of our target markets 
our capacity utilization rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
the capacity utilization rate is calculated by using our production quantity divided by our weighted average capacity in each year 
our capacity utilization rate fluctuated during those periods due to the supply of live hogs and raw materials in certain periods  the price fluctuation for live hogs in different areas near our production facilities  our maintenance of machineries and facilities  and our sales capability 
our ability to maintain higher utilization rates is also impacted by how quickly we are able to ramp up production at newly constructed facilities and how quickly the market for our products develops in new target geographies 
our target capacity utilization rate at our production facilities is approximately for chilled and frozen pork products facilities and approximately for prepared pork products facilities 
the increase in our utilization rate in was primarily due to the strong market demand for our high quality products 
we anticipate that it will typically require three to six months for utilization rates at our new production facilities to reach our target utilization rate 
our products are sold under the zhongpin brand name 
at december   our customers included international or domestic fast food companies in the prc  processing factories and  school cafeterias  factory canteens  army posts and national departments 
at such date  we also sold directly to  retail outlets  including supermarkets  within the prc 
we have established distribution networks in provinces  including four cities with special legal status  in the north  east  south and south midland of the prc  and also have formed strategic business alliances with leading supermarket chains and the catering industry in the prc 
in addition  we export products to europe  russia  hong kong and other selected countries in asia and south africa 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we evaluate  on an on going basis  our estimates for reasonableness as changes occur in our business environment 
we base our estimates on experience  the use of independent third party specialists  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments  estimates and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
revenues generated from the sale of various meat products and vegetables and fruits are recognized when these products are delivered to customers in accordance with previously agreed upon pricing and delivery arrangements  and the collectability of these sales is reasonably assured 
since the products sold by us are primarily perishable and frozen food products  the right of return is only for a few days and has been determined to be insignificant by our management 
accordingly  no provision has been made for returnable goods 
revenues presented on our consolidated income statements are net of sales taxes 
accounts receivable 
during the normal course of business  our policy is to ask larger customers to make deposits in reasonable and meaningful amounts on a case by case basis 
for certain newly developed customers  we may extend unsecured credit 
we regularly evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of each of our customers in accordance with the prevailing practice in the meat industry and based on general economic conditions in the prc 
we maintain a general policy of providing allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of those accounts that are not collected within one year plus an amount equal to of the aggregate amount of accounts receivable less than one year old 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
the company also examines the credit terms of significant customers regularly and asks for more cash deposits if these customers appear to have any indicators of delaying their payments to the company 
such deposits are usually applied for the collection of the outstanding accounts receivable during the year 
with such a practice in place  the company did not have any specific bad debt allowance provided against specific customers at december  inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a weighted average basis  and net realizable value 
work in progress and finished goods are composed of direct material  direct labor and an attributable portion of manufacturing overhead 
net realizable value is the estimated selling price  in the ordinary course of business  less estimated costs to complete and dispose 
plant  property and equipment 
plant  properties and equipment are recorded at cost and are stated net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation expense is determined using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows estimated life plants and buildings years machinery and equipment years office furniture and equipment years vehicles years maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred  whereas improvements and renewals are generally capitalized in their respective property accounts 
when an asset is retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and applicable accumulated depreciation are removed and the resulting gain or loss is recognized and reflected as a line item before operating income 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
whenever any such impairment exists  an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
we were established under the laws of the state of delaware and are subject to us federal income tax and delaware state income tax 
falcon link was established under the laws of the british virgin islands and is not subject to income tax in accordance with the laws and regulations of the british virgin islands 
our other operating subsidiaries  which are located in the prc  are subject to the prc s enterprise income tax eit law  which was effective january  and has a uniform statutory tax rate of percent 
under the eit law  income derived by an enterprise primarily from the processing of agricultural products including slaughtering live hogs is exempt from eit 
consequently  the of our subsidiaries in the prc that engage in the slaughtering of live hogs are exempted from eit 
during the years ended december     the exempted income before income tax were million  million and million  respectively 
these exempted income before income tax was deemed as part of permanent difference for the purpose to determine the proper income tax provision 
for the years ended december    and  the impact of income tax resulting from the exemption of net income from preliminary processing of agricultural products was million  million and million  respectively 
our remaining five subsidiaries in the prc are subject to the uniform tax rate on non primary processing of agricultural products 
there is no consolidated enterprise income tax return concept in the prc 
as a result  if one subsidiary has net income  that net income cannot be offset by the loss incurred by another subsidiary within the consolidated company 
similarly  if one subsidiary has a net operating loss  that net operating loss cannot be offset by the net income in another subsidiary within the consolidated company 
for the years ended december   and  there were no unrecognized tax benefits or interest and penalties recorded on income tax matters 
the company recognized no decrease in deferred tax assets or changes in the valuation allowance 
there is no unrecognized tax benefit included in the consolidated balance sheet that would  if recognized  affect the effective tax rate 
results of operations in january  we placed into operation a chilled and frozen pork production facility in yongcheng city  henan province with an annual production capacity of approximately  metric tons 
in april  we placed into operation a fruits and vegetables facility in changge city  henan province with an annual production capacity of approximately  metric tons 
in august  we upgraded a chilled and frozen pork facility in changge city and increased annual production capacity from approximately  metric tons to  metric tons 
in december  we placed into operation a prepared pork products facility in changge city  henan province with an annual production capacity of approximately  metric tons 
we are investing approximately million  not including the cost of land use rights  to build a production facility  warehouse and distribution center  and research and development center in tianjin 
this facility will have a production capacity of approximately  metric tons for chilled and frozen pork  of which will be for chilled pork and for frozen pork  and  metric tons for prepared foods 
we put the new facility for chilled and frozen pork into use ahead of schedule in january after chilled and frozen pork production at this new facility commenced  we terminated the lease for our existing production facilities in tianjin without material lease termination costs 
following such closure and with the addition of the production capacity from the new facility  our annual chilled and frozen pork production will increase by approximately to  metric tons from the current production of  metric tons 
the facility for prepared foods will be put into operation in october we are also investing approximately million to build an additional production facility in changge city  henan province 
this facility is being designed with a production capacity of  metric tons for food oil pork oil 
we expect to put this facility into operation by april in  we expect the demand for pork in the prc and the results of the pork and pork products segment of our business to remain strong 
while supply is expected to be ample  live hog prices are expected to increase in the first half of we anticipate that our gross profit margin in will remain stable 
while we expect to increase our market share in the meat and meat products segment in our target markets in  we anticipate that the global economic slowdown and the intense competition in the meat industry will adversely impact the operating results of the meat processing industry in the prc as a whole

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business 
market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments in the normal course of business that are subject to changes in financial market conditions 
currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk substantially all of our operations are conducted in the prc  with the exception of our export business and limited overseas purchases of raw materials 
most of our sales and purchases are conducted within the prc in rmb  which is the official currency of the prc 
as a result  the effect of the fluctuations of exchange rates is considered minimal to our business operations 
substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in rmb 
however  we use the united states dollar for financial reporting purposes 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of rmb  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that rmb will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the prc 
interest rate risk we do not have significant interest rate risk  as the interest we pay on substantially all of our debt obligations is calculated at a fixed rate in accordance with the terms of such indebtedness 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk  as most of our customers are long term customers with superior payment records 
our receivables are monitored regularly by our credit managers
