item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a of this form k 
real estate the following table compares the number of our stores in operation at the beginning and end of each of the last five fiscal years stores open at the beginning of the year     stores opened during the year stores closed during the year stores open at the end of the year      as part of our real estate strategy initiated in the latter half of  we closed a number of underperforming locations 
during through  we focused on improving profitability through managing our existing store base as the commercial real estate market demanded higher rent charges than our store operating model enabled us to pay 
during  the commercial real estate market softened and we were able to favorably negotiate renewals for certain store leases which previously may have resulted in store closures 
also during  we successfully negotiated a number of new store leases as the availability of space improved and rental rates eased 
for additional information about our real estate strategy  see the accompanying md a 
the following table details our stores by state at january  alabama maine ohio arizona maryland oklahoma arkansas massachusetts oregon california michigan pennsylvania colorado minnesota rhode island connecticut mississippi south carolina delaware missouri tennessee florida montana texas georgia nebraska utah idaho nevada vermont illinois new hampshire virginia indiana new jersey washington iowa new mexico west virginia kansas new york wisconsin kentucky north carolina wyoming louisiana north dakota total stores  number of states of our  stores  operate in four states california  texas  ohio  and florida  and net sales from stores in these states represented of our net sales 
associates at january   we had approximately  active associates comprised of  full time and  part time associates 
temporary associates hired during the fall and winter holiday selling season increased the number of associates to a peak of  in approximately of the associates employed throughout the year are employed on a part time basis 
we consider our relationship with our associates to be good  and we are not a party to any labor agreements 
competition we operate in the highly competitive retail industry and face strong sales competition from other general merchandise  discount  food  arts and crafts  and dollar store retailers 
additionally  we compete with a number of companies for retail site locations  to attract and retain quality employees  and to acquire our broad assortment of closeout merchandise from vendors 
purchasing an integral part of our business is the sourcing and purchasing of quality brand name merchandise directly from manufacturers and other vendors typically at prices substantially below those paid by traditional retailers 
we believe that we have built strong relationships with many brand name vendors and we have capitalized on our purchasing power in the closeout marketplace  including our ability to pay timely  and to source merchandise that provides exceptional value to our customers 
we have the ability to source and purchase significant quantities of a vendor s closeout merchandise in specific product categories and to control distribution in accordance with vendor instructions 
we believe this provides a high level of service and convenience to our vendors 
our sourcing channels also include bankruptcies  liquidations  and insurance claims 
we supplement our traditional brand name closeout purchases with various direct import and domestically sourced merchandise  which represents merchandise that our customers consistently expect us to have in our stores or merchandise that we believe offers our customers a significant value 
we expect that the unpredictability of the retail and manufacturing environments coupled with our dominant purchasing power position will continue to support our ability to source quality closeout merchandise at competitive prices 
we have a buying team with extensive closeout purchasing experience  which we believe has enabled us to develop successful long term relationships with many of the largest and most recognized vendors in the united states 
we believe that  as a result of these relationships and our experience and reputation in the closeout industry  many vendors offer buying opportunities to us prior to attempting to dispose of their merchandise through other channels 
our merchandise is purchased from domestic and foreign vendors that provide us with multiple sources for each product category 
in  our top ten vendors accounted for approximately of total purchases at cost while the largest vendor accounted for approximately of total purchases at cost 
during  we purchased approximately of our merchandise directly from overseas vendors  including approximately from vendors located in china 
additionally  a significant amount of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad 
as a result  a significant portion of our merchandise supply is subject to certain risks as described further in item a in this form k 
warehouse and distribution the majority of the merchandise sold by us is received and processed for retail sale and distributed to the retail locations from our five regional distribution centers located in pennsylvania  ohio  alabama  oklahoma and california 
some of our vendors deliver merchandise directly to our stores 
we previously operated two furniture distribution centers located in redlands  california and columbus  ohio 
during  we integrated the distribution of furniture from our redlands  california furniture distribution center into our regional distribution center in california 
during  we integrated the distribution of furniture from our columbus  ohio furniture distribution center into our regional distribution centers in pennsylvania  ohio  alabama and oklahoma 
we believe these changes allow us to more efficiently flow furniture to our stores primarily by reducing the transportation cost from the furniture distribution centers to the stores because the regional distribution centers are generally located closer to the stores they service 
we manage the inventory levels of merchandise in our distribution centers so that we can distribute merchandise quickly and efficiently to our stores in order to maximize sales and our inventory turnover rate 
we selected the locations of our distribution centers in an attempt to minimize transportation costs and the distance from distribution centers to our stores 
in addition to the merchandise distribution centers  we operate a warehouse in ohio that distributes store fixtures and supplies 
during  we integrated the distribution of store fixtures and supplies out of our redlands  california furniture distribution center into our ohio warehouse 
we believe this change reduces our fixed overhead and operating costs  and allows us to more effectively manage store fixtures and supplies inventory 
during the past three years  we implemented several warehouse  distribution  and outbound transportation initiatives  including but not limited to a vendor compliance program in that imposes strict documentation and packing requirements on shipments of merchandise that we receive in our distribution centers  an outbound transportation initiative in that led to a higher use of one way carriers and thus a reduction in round trip miles  the integration in and of our former furniture distribution centers into all of our regional distribution centers  and other transportation initiatives aimed at lowering our inbound and outbound transportation costs 
for additional information regarding our warehouses and distribution facilities and related initiatives  see the discussion under the caption warehouse and distribution in item properties  of this form k and the discussion under the caption operating strategy cost structure in the accompanying md a in this form k 
advertising and promotion our brand image is an important part of our marketing program 
our principal trademarks  including the big lots family of trademarks  have been registered with the us patent and trademark office 
we use a variety of marketing approaches to promote our brand and retail position through television  internet  in store point of purchase  and print media 
the centerpiece of our marketing efforts is our television campaign which combines elements of strategic branding and promotion 
these same elements are then used in all other consumer touch points 
our highly targeted media placement strategy uses national cable as the foundation of our television buys which is then supplemented with local broadcast in key markets 
our marketing program utilizes printed advertising circulars  which we design  and are distributed in all markets that are served by our stores 
in and  we distributed multi page circulars covering weeks which we will repeat in we distribute circulars through a combination of newspaper insertions and mailings 
we create regional versions of these circulars to take advantage of market differences caused by product availability  climate  and customer preferences 
in addition  we use in store promotional materials  including in store signage  emphasize special bargains and significant values offered to customers 
we continue to use our website www 
biglots 
com as a key touch point for special catalogs and our online advertising  attracting over million unique visitors each week 
in  we overhauled and re launched our website 
our on line customer list  which we refer to as the buzz club  has grown from just over one million members at the end of to approximately five million members at the end of the buzz club database is an important marketing tool which allows us to communicate in a cost effective manner with our customer  including e mail delivery of our circulars 
in addition to buzz club  in august of  we started our buzz club rewards program rewards  which has grown to million members at the end of fiscal members of the rewards program use a membership card when making purchases and earn discounts on future purchases when they meet certain thresholds 
rewards members may also receive other targeted promotions via e mail 
total advertising expense as a percentage of total net sales was in and in and seasonality we have historically experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations  with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit realized in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition  our quarterly net sales and operating profits can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings  the timing of television and circular advertising  and the timing of certain holidays 
we historically receive a higher proportion of merchandise  carry higher inventory levels  and incur higher outbound shipping and payroll expenses as a percentage of sales in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter 
the fourth fiscal quarter typically includes a leveraging effect on operating results because net sales are higher and certain of our costs are fixed such as rent and depreciation 
the seasonality of our net sales and related merchandise inventory requirements influences our availability of and demand for cash or access to credit 
we historically have maintained and drawn upon our credit facility to fund our working capital requirements  which typically peak slightly before or after the end of our third fiscal quarter 
we historically have higher net sales  operating profits  and cash flow provided by operations in the fourth fiscal quarter which allows us to substantially repay our seasonal borrowings 
in  our total indebtedness outstanding borrowings and letters of credit peaked at approximately million in early february under our million unsecured credit facility entered into in october credit agreement 
as of january   we had no borrowings under the million unsecured credit facility entered into in april credit agreement  which replaced the credit agreement 
we expect that borrowings will vary throughout depending on various factors  including our seasonal need to acquire merchandise inventory prior to peak selling seasons  the timing and amount of sales to our customers and the potential impact of shares repurchased under our authorized share repurchase program

risk factors the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully 
in addition  these statements constitute cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of our disclosure and analysis in this form k and in our annual report to shareholders contain some forward looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
from time to time  we also provide forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forward looking statements 
such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events  they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we have tried  wherever possible  to identify such statements by using words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  objective  goal  project  intend  plan  believe  will  should  may  target  forecast  guidance  outlook  and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  forward looking statements include statements relating to future actions  future performance  or results of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  expenses  interest rates  the outcome of contingencies  such as legal proceedings  and financial results 
we cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated  estimated  or projected results set forth in the forward looking statements 
you should bear this in mind as you consider forward looking statements 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date thereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k filed with the sec 
also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks  uncertainties  and assumptions relevant to our businesses 
there can be no assurances that we have correctly and completely identified  assessed  and accounted for all factors that do or may affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
these are factors that  individually or in the aggregate  we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us 
should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
consequently  all of the forward looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements  and there can be no assurance that the results or developments we anticipate will be realized or that they will have the expected effects on our business or operations 
we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
our ability to achieve the results contemplated by forward looking statements is subject to a number of factors  any one  or a combination  of which could materially affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
these factors may include  but are not limited to the current economic conditions including falling home prices  high levels of unemployment  foreclosures on mortgages  bankruptcies  and reduced access to credit give rise to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity including  but not limited to the following fluctuating commodity prices  including but not limited to diesel fuel and other fuels used to generate power by utilities  may affect our gross profit and operating profit margins 
the impact of these conditions on our vendors businesses cannot be predicted 
our vendors may be negatively impacted due to insufficient availability of credit to fund their operations or insufficient demand for their products  which may affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us 
our expectations regarding the demand for our merchandise may be inaccurate  which could cause us to under buy or over buy certain categories or departments of merchandise  which could result in customer dissatisfaction or excessive markdowns required to sell through the merchandise 
the reaction of our competitors to the marketplace  including the level of liquidations occurring at bankrupt retailers  may drive our competitors  some of whom are better capitalized than us  to offer significant discounts or promotions on their merchandise  which could negatively affect our sales and profit margins 
a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital or increase the borrowing rates we pay 
a significant decline in the market value of our qualified defined benefit pension plan s pension plan investment portfolios may affect our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
additionally  many of the effects and consequences of the financial market uncertainties and broad economic downturn are currently unknown and beyond our control  any one or all of them could potentially have a material adverse impact on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
if we are unable to continue to successfully execute our operating strategies  our operating performance could be significantly impacted 
there is a risk that we will be unable to continue to meet or exceed our operating performance targets and goals in the future if our strategies and initiatives are unsuccessful 
in  we announced operating performance targets and goals as part of an updated strategic plan  that we intend to use as our roadmap for the next three years see the accompanying md a for additional information concerning our operating strategy 
the new plan includes a continued focus on merchandising  real estate  and cost structure 
if we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive discount retail industry  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
the discount retail business is highly competitive 
as discussed in item of this form k  we compete for customers  employees  products  real estate  and other aspects of our business with a number of other companies 
certain of our competitors have greater financial  distribution  marketing  and other resources than us 
it is possible that increased competition or improved performance by our competitors may reduce our market share  gross margin  and operating margin  and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in other ways 
declines in general economic condition  consumer spending levels  and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise thereby materially adversely affecting our revenues and gross margin 
our results of operations can be directly impacted by the health of the united states economy 
our business and financial performance may be adversely impacted by current and future economic conditions  including factors that may restrict or otherwise negatively impact consumer financing  disposable income levels  unemployment levels  energy costs  interest rates  recession  inflation  the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities  and other matters that influence consumer spending 
the economies of four states ohio  texas  california  and florida are particularly important as approximately of our current stores operate in these states and of our net sales occurred in these states 
changes by vendors related to the management of their inventories may reduce the quantity and quality of brand name closeout merchandise available to us or may increase our cost to acquire brand name closeout merchandise  either of which may materially adversely affect our revenues and gross margin 
the products we sell are sourced from a variety of vendors with approximately half of our merchandise assortment being pre planned and made for us and approximately half of our merchandise sourced on a closeout basis 
the portion of our assortment that is pre planned and made for us consists of imported merchandise primarily furniture  seasonal  and portions of our home categories along with certain other classifications like toys or merchandise that is re orderable upon demand 
for the closeout component of our business  we do not control the supply  design  function  availability  or cost of many of the products that we offer for sale 
we depend upon the sufficient availability of closeout merchandise that we can acquire and offer at prices that represent a value to our customers  in order to meet or exceed our operating performance targets for gross margin 
in addition  we rely on our vendors to provide us with quality merchandise 
to the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory  the amount of closeout merchandise available to us could be materially reduced 
shortages or disruptions in the availability of closeout merchandise of a quality acceptable to our customers and us  would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and gross margin and may result in customer dissatisfaction 
we rely on vendors located in foreign countries for significant amounts of merchandise 
additionally  a significant amount of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad 
our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade 
global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in driving higher gross margin 
during  we purchased approximately of our products directly from overseas vendors including from vendors located in china 
our ability to find qualified vendors and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge  especially with respect to goods sourced outside of the united states 
global sourcing and foreign trade involve numerous factors and uncertainties beyond our control including increased import duties  increased shipping costs  more restrictive quotas  loss of most favored nation trading status  currency and exchange rate fluctuations  work stoppages  transportation delays  economic uncertainties such as inflation  foreign government regulations  political unrest  natural disasters  war  terrorism  trade restrictions including retaliation by the united states against foreign practices  political instability  the financial stability of vendors  merchandise quality issues  and tariffs 
these and other issues affecting our international vendors could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance 
disruption to our distribution network  the capacity of our distribution centers  and the timely receipt of merchandise inventory could adversely affect our operating performance 
we rely on the ability to replenish depleted merchandise inventory through deliveries to our distribution centers and from the distribution centers to our stores by various means of transportation  including shipments by sea  rail and truck carriers 
a decrease in the capacity of carriers and or labor strikes or shortages in the transportation industry could negatively affect our distribution network  the timely receipt of merchandise and transportation costs 
in addition  long term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure from wars  political unrest  terrorism  natural disasters and other significant events that lead to delays or interruptions of service could adversely affect our business 
also  a fire  earthquake  or other disaster at one of our distribution centers could disrupt our timely receiving  processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 
as we continue to grow  we may face increased or unexpected demands on distribution center operations  as well as unexpected demands on our distribution network 
in addition  new store locations receiving shipments that are increasingly further away from our distribution centers will increase transportation costs and may create transportation scheduling strains 
our inability to properly manage our inventory levels and offer merchandise that our customers want may materially adversely impact our business and financial performance 
we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully 
however  we also must guard against accumulating excess inventory as we seek to maintain appropriate in stock levels 
as stated above  we obtain approximately a quarter of our merchandise from vendors outside of the united states 
these foreign vendors often require lengthy advance notice of our requirements in order to be able to supply products in the quantities that we request 
this usually requires us to order merchandise and enter into purchase order contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise well in advance of the time these products are offered for sale 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in responding to a changing retail environment  which makes us vulnerable to changes in price and in consumer preferences 
in addition  even though the lead time to obtain domestically sourced merchandise is less  we attempt to maximize our gross margin and operating efficiency by delivering proper quantities of merchandise to our stores in a timely manner 
if we do not accurately anticipate future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to replenish inventory levels  our inventory levels may not be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted 
changes in federal or state legislation and regulations  including the effects of legislation and regulations on product safety  could increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our operating performance 
we are exposed to the risk that new federal or state legislation  including new product safety laws and regulations  may negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our operating performance 
for example  the consumer product safety improvement act of addresses a number of consumer product safety issues  including the permissible levels of lead and phthalates in certain products 
additional changes in product safety legislation or regulations may lead to product recalls and the disposal or write off of merchandise  as well as fines or penalties and reputational damage 
if our merchandise  including food and consumable products  do not meet applicable governmental safety standards or our customers expectations regarding quality or safety  we could experience lost sales  increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk 
our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements  or execute product recalls in a timely manner  could result in fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  negative customer perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause us to lose market share to our competitors 
if this occurs  it may be difficult for us to regain lost sales 
we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings  including fair labor standards act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits  which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 
from time to time  we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions  including various collective or class action lawsuits that are brought against us for alleged violations of the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we may not be able to accurately determine the impact on us of any future adverse outcome of such proceedings 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves 
for a description of certain current legal proceedings  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we may be subject to risks associated with changes in laws  regulations  and accounting standards that may adversely affect our business and financial performance 
changes in governmental regulations and accounting standards  including new interpretations and applications of accounting standards  may have adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
the bankruptcy of our formerly owned kb toys business may adversely affect our business and financial performance 
in december  we sold the kb toys business to kb acquisition corporation 
on january   kb acquisition corporation and certain affiliated entities collectively kb i filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to chapter of title of the united states code 
on august   in connection with the acquisition by an affiliate of prentice capital management of majority ownership of kb i  kb i emerged from their january  bankruptcy the kb toys business that emerged from bankruptcy is hereinafter referred to as kb ii 
on december   kb ii filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to chapter of title of the united states code 
based on information we have received subsequent to the december  bankruptcy filing  we believe we may have indemnification and guarantee obligations kb ii bankruptcy lease obligations with respect to kb toys store leases and a lease for a former kb corporate office 
because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability  our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
for additional information regarding the kb toys bankruptcies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
a significant decline in our operating profit and taxable income may impair our ability to realize the value of our long lived assets and deferred tax assets 
we are required by accounting rules to periodically assess our property and equipment and deferred tax assets for impairment and recognize an impairment loss or valuation charge  if necessary 
in performing these assessments  we use our historical financial performance to determine whether we have potential impairments or valuation concerns and as evidence to support our assumptions about future financial performance 
if our financial performance significantly declines  it could negatively affect the results of our assessments of the recoverability of our property and equipment and our deferred tax assets 
there is a risk that if our future operating results significantly decline  it could impair our ability to recover the value of our property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
impairment or valuation charges taken against property and equipment and deferred tax assets could be material and could have a material adverse impact on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity see the discussion under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates in the accompanying md a in this form k for additional information regarding our accounting policies for long lived assets and income taxes 
our inability  if any  to comply with the terms of the credit agreement may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
we have the ability to borrow funds under the credit agreement and we utilize this ability at various times depending on operating or other cash flow requirements 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on indebtedness  liens  and investments  as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
a violation of these covenants may permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access loans and letters of credit and may require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans 
if we are not in compliance with these covenants  it may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner  our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient 
we depend on a variety of information systems for the efficient functioning of our business 
we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business 
the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers 
costs and potential interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of our existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our business 
if we are unable to successfully execute our sap for retail system implementation  our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient 
in january  we announced our plans to implement sap for retail solutions over the next few years 
new financial systems  including general ledger  accounts payable and fixed assets  were developed and tested during and the new financial systems have been placed in service in a new core merchandising system is planned for development and testing in and  with plans to place the new core merchandising system in service when testing has been completed 
the implementation of these systems is expected to have a pervasive impact on our information systems and across a significant portion of our general office operations  including merchandising  technology  and finance 
if we are unable to successfully implement sap for retail  it may have an adverse effect on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
if we are unable to retain existing and secure suitable new store locations under favorable lease terms  our financial performance may be negatively affected 
we lease almost all of our stores and a significant number of these leases expire or are up for renewal each year 
our strategy to improve our financial performance includes sales growth while managing the occupancy cost of each of our stores 
a component of our sales growth strategy is to open new store locations 
if we are not able to negotiate favorable new store leases and lease renewals  our financial position  results of operations  and liquidity may be negatively affected 
if we are unable to secure customer  employee  and company data  our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to penalties or lawsuits 
the protection of our customer  employee  and company data is critical to us 
the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding  with frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across our business 
in addition  our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information 
a significant breach of customer  employee  or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales  fines  and or lawsuits 
if we lose key personnel  it may have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
we believe that we benefit substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives 
the loss of services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse impact on our business 
competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit  train  and retain our senior executives and other qualified personnel 
the price of our common shares as traded on the new york stock exchange may be volatile 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of factors beyond our control  including but not limited to  general economic and stock market conditions  risks relating to our business and industry as discussed above  strategic actions by us or our competitors  variations in our quarterly operating performance  our future sales or purchases of our common shares  and investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common shares relative to other investment alternatives 
we also may be subject to a number of other factors which may  individually or in the aggregate  materially or adversely affect our business 
these factors include  but are not limited to events or circumstances could occur which could create bad publicity for us or for types of merchandise offered in our stores which may negatively impact our business results including sales  infringement of our intellectual property  including the big lots trademarks  could dilute our value  our ability to attract and retain suitable employees  our ability to establish effective advertising  marketing  and promotional programs  and other risks described from time to time in our filings with the sec

comparable store sales for stores open at least two years at the beginning of increased 
we operated an average of  stores throughout compared to  average stores throughout sales per selling square foot were in and in gross margin as a percent of sales increased basis points to of sales in from of sales in gross margin dollars were higher by 
average inventory levels were slightly lower throughout compared to and  combined with the increase in net sales  resulted in a higher inventory turnover rate of times in compared to times in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased basis points to of sales from of sales in depreciation expense as a percent of sales decreased basis points to of sales in from of sales in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved to per share in compared to per share in cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in our total inventory per average store was down at the end of compared to our accounts payable leverage increased at the end of as a result of a shift in our negotiated vendor payment terms towards a longer payment period which is more consistent with our retail competitors

seasonality as discussed in item under the seasonality caption  our financial results fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on various factors such as timing of new or closed stores  timing and extent of advertisements and promotions  and timing of holidays 
we expect that the christmas holiday selling season will continue to result in a significant portion of our sales and operating profits 
if our sales performance is significantly better or worse during this time frame  we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results 
the following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit for   and by fiscal quarter first second third fourth fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit as a percentage of full year fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit as a percentage of full year fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit as a percentage of full year operating strategy over the past four fiscal years fiscal through fiscal  we have successfully repositioned our business by concentrating our efforts on the implementation of a strategy we refer to as the what s important now strategy win strategy 
the win strategy focuses on three key elements of the business merchandising  real estate  and the cost structure 
the win strategy has been an operating profit growth strategy designed to expand the operating profit rate of our existing store base 
only recently  in  as the commercial real estate market softened and rents declined  did we pursue net new store growth 
due to the implementation of win  our operating profit rate has expanded from in to in with operating profit dollars growing from million to million during that same time period 
the growth in operating profit has translated to significant growth in earnings per share from continuing operations  which has increased from per diluted share in to per diluted share in along the way  we generated approximately billion of cash of which approximately million was capital reinvested in our business and million was returned to shareholders aggregate share repurchases in  and under publicly announced share repurchase programs 
in  we anticipate the key elements of the win strategy will remain consistent and we are forecasting continued operating profit growth 
however  we believe we are entering the next phase of the win strategy a growth phase 
the commercial real estate market has softened  thus providing more real estate available for us at prices that are more appropriate for our financial model and return on capital requirements 
given the strength of our financial performance we are in a better position to open new stores and take advantage of the current real estate market conditions 
in  we expect an operating profit rate of to based on an estimated comparable store sales increase of to  flat gross margin rate  and expense leverage compared to last year 
earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be to 
opening new stores and closing stores  for net growth of stores or 
cash provided by operating activities of approximately million less capital expenditures of approximately million resulting in million of cash available for investment or redeployment  and the remaining million of purchases under the repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion  subject to market conditions and other factors 
on march   we executed a million accelerated share repurchase transaction 
the following sections provide additional discussion and analysis of our win strategy with respect to merchandising  real estate  and cost structure 
the compared to section below provides additional discussion and analysis of the impact of these strategies on our financial performance and the assumptions and expectations upon which we are basing our guidance for our future results 
merchandising from a merchandising perspective  our competitive positioning as the largest broadline closeout retailer affords us a strategic advantage when sourcing merchandise for our stores 
we source our merchandise in three key ways closeouts  or excess inventory  comprise approximately half of the merchandise available for sale to our customers 
manufacturers and vendors have excess merchandise for a number of different reasons including retailers canceling orders  retailers going out of business  marketing or packaging changes  a new product launch that has failed  or for other various reasons 
in these situations  we are able to source product at a discounted cost and offer significant value savings to our customers 
we currently have thousands of vendor relationships for excess inventory that have been developed over many years 
these relationships along with the size and financial strength of our company are a key barrier to entry and minimize the opportunities for other competitors to enter our retail segment 
for certain merchandise categories  there is not always an abundant supply of excess inventory 
in certain merchandise categories under these situations  we will work with vendors to develop product and import merchandise from overseas 
imports total approximately to of our merchandise sold in any given year 
categories with the highest concentration of imports include seasonal  furniture  and to a lesser extent home and the toys department 
the balance of our merchandise assortment is replenishable type product or the captive label businesses we operate 
the merchandise has a consistency of flow and availability so that it can be offered in our stores day in and day out 
it has many of the same characteristics as our closeout business but is replenishable upon demand 
our prices on this merchandise are still positioned below our competition although to a lesser extent than the closeout component of our business 
we offer six major merchandising categories in our store consumables  seasonal  home  hardlines  furniture  and other 
these categories range in size with consumables as the single largest at of sales in and other as the smallest at of sales in in recent years  our merchandising strategies to increase sales have been predominantly focused on growing the size of the basket  or average transaction value 
there have been two primary methods to accomplishing this goal drive more units per transaction  and grow the average item retail by offering our customers better quality merchandise  better values  and more prominent brand name products 
this approach is consistent with our customer research which suggests that our core customer recognizes quality and brands and is willing to pay a higher retail price  so long as the value or cost savings is significant compared to what other retailers are offering 
this strategy has resulted in fewer cartons processed by our distribution centers and stores and achieved positive comparable store sales 
while executing our win strategy  we have made measurable progress towards our goals of growing sales per selling square foot which increased from per square foot in to per square foot in and increasing gross margin dollars which increased from  million in to  million in 
from a merchandising perspective in  our goal is to provide extreme value  improved quality  and continue to increase the presence of recognizable brand name merchandise in our stores 
we expect our major merchandise categories will remain the same as prior years but the percentage of business by category may fluctuate from time to time based on customer demand and the availability of compelling deals that we are able to source and offer in our stores 
strategically  we anticipate opportunity does exist to continue to grow the basket  or average transaction value  through the same successful initiatives that benefitted results over the last few years 
additionally  during and in future years  we believe there are specific initiatives in marketing and store operations designed to begin to grow the number of transactions in our stores 
our marketing efforts involve a mix of printed circulars  in store marketing  television  and online advertising 
much of our marketing is based on information that we have learned about our customers  principally through customer surveys 
based on this information  we believe over of our core customers come to our stores without a shopping list or without a specific item or brand in mind to purchase 
value dominates top of mind awareness as our customers look to us for savings 
nearly one half of the customers surveyed said their shopping trips to our stores last over minutes  which we interpret as them coming to shop our stores for the treasure hunt 
we have improved  and expect to continue to develop  our in store signage and merchandising displays and arrangements 
we continue to market to our buzz club members  by offering a free online membership and alerting them to new merchandise and offerings in our stores 
additionally  in  we launched our rewards program which is the first true loyalty card program in the company s history 
after enrolling in this program  the customer receives a rewards card which is to be presented and scanned at the register at time of purchase 
after ten qualifying purchases each of or more  the rewards member will receive a coupon for off a future purchase in our stores 
additionally  members will receive  via email  our ad circulars and other targeted promotional materials 
due to the investments made in our store register systems during and  each time a rewards card is scanned we have the technology to record and monitor purchasing behavior 
from a marketing perspective in  there are three key initiatives designed to help to build transactions first  the rewards program and building the membership base is a key driver to future transaction growth 
as of march   we have over million rewards members 
to date  stores with the highest amount of rewards member signups or penetration are seeing incremental transaction lifts in the low single digits 
during  we will be implementing technology that will enable us to offer our members targeted messages or promotions based on their specific buying patterns 
second  using our ad circulars and promotional pricing to create more buzzbuilders excitement could help increase transactions 
the excitement created by buzzbuilders is predominantly achieved through price but uniqueness of item can be a factor as well 
lastly  we have expanded the mix of tender accepted in our stores and effective february  we began accepting the american express card 
american express cardholders typically have higher income demographics than other cardholders and we believe the marketing efforts and support from the vendor could increase our market share in that demographic 
from a store operations perspective  we began the company wide rollout of our ready for business program in the program has certain performance criteria and standards aimed at improving the consistency of visual presentation  merchandise recovery efforts  and overall store cleanliness 
ready for business also focuses on improvements in our employee training programs and hiring practices 
this higher level of expectation and accountability within our store operations team increased the turnover rate of our district managers  store managers  and assistant store managers in and required us to recruit new talent to the organization 
in  we believe that continued focus on ready for business standards and the investment made in talent in could help to improve sales through both the size of the average basket and the number of transactions 
additionally  with a higher level of confidence in the discipline on store standards and a higher caliber management team in place  we have identified certain investments in both store layout and store improvement capital which we will be executing throughout this effort will address approximately stores with potential upside sales opportunities 
real estate from the beginning of fiscal through fiscal  we slowed our rate of new store openings based on our belief that many of the real estate locations available to us in the marketplace were too expensive and as such the return on investment would not be satisfactory to our shareholders 
during through  we opened a total of only new stores in  in  and in 
during the same timeframe  we closed existing stores in  in  and in for various reasons including lack of profitability  proposed new lease terms where rents were escalating and landlords were unwilling to renegotiate terms  or relocating the store to a potentially more productive location 
as a result of improvements in our store productivity and overall profitability over the last four years and the softening of the real estate market  we were able to grow our store base in for the first time in the last five years 
we opened new stores and closed stores in the majority of our new store openings were what we refer to as traditional stores  which are secondary or tertiary real estate normally located in retail strip centers 
additionally  in we tested two new store initiatives a locations and a smaller store concept 
generally speaking  new store openings performed very well in with a locations exceeding our expectations  traditional stores overall meeting our expectations and our small store test producing mixed results 
we believe we have opportunities with respect to the lease options included in our existing store leases 
as stated in item properties  of this form k  we have store leases that expire in we expect to close approximately of these stores  some of which have not performed to our expectations  some of which have no more lease renewal options and we expect the landlord to choose a different tenant  and some of which we anticipate exiting by our choice in favor of relocating the store to a new location in a nearby area 
for our remaining approximately store locations with lease expirations  we expect to exercise our renewal option or negotiate more favorable lease renewal terms sufficient enough to enable us to achieve an acceptable return on our investment 
our real estate strategy has included the following additional investments in our existing fleet of stores in order to improve operating efficiency in and  we invested approximately million to implement our new point of sale register system in all of our existing stores with the expected benefits to include more timely and accurate sales and inventory information  improved customer service through faster speed at checkout  lower repair and maintenance costs  and improved labor efficiency through the use of hand held technology 
in and  we invested approximately million in store retrofits and new merchandise fixtures at approximately of our stores to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications  specifically furniture 
in  we tested a new store layout in approximately locations  predominantly in columbus  ohio 
the layout test was designed to improve the ease of shopping our stores 
it features consumables more prominently in our store and improves the visual sight lines within the store 
the customer reaction indicated that the store seemed better organized  cleaner  and has improved lighting  wider aisles  and generally presents merchandise more effectively 
based on our evaluation of the test results  we will expand this program to an additional stores in also in  we made certain investments  both capital and expense  in a food refresh program 
the program emphasizes cleanliness and merchandise presentation in our food departments and it included new or refinished fixtures in approximately one half of our stores while all stores received new signage and shelf labeling 
based on feedback from our customers  we believe improved cleanliness  better fixtures  and dedicated associate staffing to maintain a better merchandise presentation instills customer confidence in the quality and freshness of our food merchandise 
in  we plan to increase the level of new store openings to new stores and expect to close approximately stores resulting in net store growth of locations  or of the total store base 
in terms of the breakout of what types of stores we expect to open  the availability of space for our traditional locations remains good  rents are reasonable  and we estimate we will open approximately traditional stores in in regards to a locations  we see a meaningful opportunity for growth in and estimate that we will open approximately new a locations this year 
this is a major step forward for our company and has been made possible by the softening in the commercial real estate market and the strength of our financial performance over the last several years 
additionally  a higher quality and more branded merchandise assortment along with improvements in store standards and customer service have given us the confidence that we can be successful in these locations with a new customer base that has a somewhat higher level of expectations in terms of the in store shopping experience 
during  we learned a great deal through our small store test about the operational aspects and the merchandising changes or edits that are critical in this size of store 
we will continue to make modifications to our test stores and monitor their progress 
along the way in  we may also add a couple of stores to the test 
cost structure our goal each year is to continue to generate expense leverage lower expenses as a percent of net sales 
we believe that several operational changes we have made  which we continue to refine  have significantly contributed to the achievement of our leverage goals 
some of the operational changes made include reduced inventory levels at our stores and regional distribution centers 
purchased and distributed merchandise to our stores in optimal quantities and pack sizes to minimize handling in our distribution centers and stores 
timed receipt of merchandise in stores closer to the expected display dates in order to avoid excessive handling merchandise 
increased the percentage of merchandise that arrives in our stores pre ticketed and pre packaged for efficient display and sale 
refined our staffing and payroll scheduling models in our stores  and implemented several initiatives which lowered our distribution and outbound transportation expenses 
as a result of these operational changes and certain other initiatives in the business  our overall expenses as a percent of sales have declined by basis points expense rate of versus expense rate of 
for  we are forecasting an expense rate of to 
expense dollars are expected to decline in the areas of advertising  utilities  and insurance based on certain company specific initiatives developed by management 
store expenses along with distribution and transportation costs are expected to leverage as dollar growth in these areas is forecasted to be at a slower rate than our anticipated sales growth 
partially offsetting this leverage  we believe costs will increase and deleverage areas such as occupancy  depreciation  and equity related compensation expense  given the significant increase in our share price over the last months 
discontinued operations we continue to incur exit related costs for some of the stores we closed in that we have classified as discontinued operations  specifically on the stores where lease obligations remain 
we also report certain activity related to our prior ownership of the kb toys business in discontinued operations 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of all of our discontinued operations 
share repurchase program in december  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to million of our common shares 
no shares were repurchased under this program in on march   based upon the strength of our operating performance and cash flow generation during the fourth fiscal quarter of and our estimated cash flow for fiscal  our board of directors authorized a million increase to our million program bringing the total authorization of the repurchase program to million 
on march   we utilized million of the authorization to execute an accelerated share repurchase transaction which reduced our common shares outstanding by million 
the total number of shares repurchased under the asr will be based upon the volume weighted average price of our stock over a predetermined period and will not be known until that period ends and a final settlement occurs 
the final settlement could increase or decrease the million shares initially reduced from our outstanding common shares 
the remaining million will be utilized to repurchase shares in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion  subject to market conditions and other factors 
common shares acquired through the repurchase program will be available to meet obligations under equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes 
the repurchase program will continue until exhausted and will be funded with cash and cash equivalents  cash generated during fiscal or  if needed  by drawing on our million unsecured credit facility 
compared to net sales as previously discussed  we manage our business on the basis of one segment broadline closeout retailing 
we report net sales information for six merchandise categories 
net sales by merchandise category  as a percentage of total net sales  and net sales change in dollars and percentage in compared to were as follows change in thousands consumables    home    furniture    hardlines    seasonal    other    net sales    net sales increased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in the increase in net sales was principally due to our comparable store sales increase of  or approximately million  and non comparable store sales  which increased by approximately million 
our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of the current fiscal year 
this calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria 
the average number of stores in operation throughout and was approximately  stores and  stores  respectively 
following a comparable store sales decrease of through the first half of  sales trends improved resulting in a comparable store sales increase of in the second half of thereby producing an annual comparable store sales increase of 
comparable store sales increased in the low to mid single digits from september through january due to improvements in our merchandise offering  and improved discretionary spending trends as we met the first anniversary of the significant economic turmoil that began to impact us in our fourth fiscal quarter of specifically  comparable store sales increased in the fourth fiscal quarter of based on these trends and sales results of february  we estimate comparable store sales will increase in the range of to 
from a merchandise perspective  sales in most major merchandise categories increased in compared to consumables continued its consistent sales growth throughout the year 
consumers continued to seek out value when shopping for the everyday household use items that we offer in our consumables business 
we believe our strategy of offering name brands at competitive prices led to this consistently positive net sales performance in the consumables category 
the home category net sales consistently underperformed through the second fiscal quarter 
however  accelerating sales trends in the second half of due to certain merchandise assortment changes and the improvement experienced in consumer discretionary spending trends led to a total sales increase for fiscal the furniture category also underperformed through the third fiscal quarter principally due to lower sales in our mattress department 
however  new key items in upholstery and case goods along with a sales rebound in our mattress department led to a fourth fiscal quarter comparable store sales increase in the high single digits leading to our overall sales increase of for the hardlines category continued its increase in net sales driven by sales of electronics  particularly dvds  cameras and televisions 
the seasonal category net sales produced positive results in the second half of the year due to a comparable sales increase of our christmas merchandise in the fourth fiscal quarter 
the other category sales decline is primarily due to three large closeout deals drugstore merchandise  furniture  and apparel that occurred in  fewer closeout deals were sold in the other category in partly offsetting the closeout deals decline was an increase in toy department sales 
gross margin gross margin dollars increased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher gross margin rate and the increase in sales 
the increase in gross margin rate increased gross margin dollars by approximately million 
also contributing to the increased gross margin dollars was higher net sales of million  which increased gross margin dollars by approximately million 
the gross margin rate increase was principally due to higher initial mark up on merchandise sold  lower inbound freight costs and a lower shrink accrual rate 
we achieved lower inbound freight costs in because of lower diesel fuel costs  lower ocean freight rates  renegotiated carrier rates  and careful review of the mode of transportation to find the most efficient method to ship goods to our distribution centers 
the gross margin rate also benefitted from favorable adjustments to the shrink accrual as physical inventories were completed at our stores 
our inventory turnover improved to turns in compared to turns in based on historical results and current economic conditions  we expect our gross margin rate to be approximately  or flat compared to  as strength in initial mark up  lower shrink costs and a slightly lower markdown rate are expected to be offset by rising freight costs  both import and domestic 
based on the current general economic trends  our vendors may be negatively impacted by insufficient availability of credit to fund their operations or insufficient demand for their products  which may affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us 
additionally  the general economic conditions have caused a higher level of uncertainty of our forecasted sales results  and thus  demand for our merchandise could differ materially from our expectation causing us to under or over buy certain merchandise  which may result in customer dissatisfaction or excessive markdowns required to liquidate the merchandise 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in the increase in selling and administrative expenses was principally caused by an increase in store occupancy expenses of million  higher employee benefit expenses of million  higher share based compensation expense of million  litigation related expenses of million  and bonuses of million 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs and a million decrease in advertising expenses 
the increase in store occupancy expenses is primarily due to higher rents and real estate taxes related to the leases of the new stores opened in and the increase in employee benefits is principally due to higher paid health insurance claims and pension expense 
the increase in share based compensation is primarily due to our acceleration of vesting of restricted stock grants based on our profit performance in in  we accrued million for a certain legal settlement agreement see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the million increase of bonuses was directly related to our performance 
the decline in distribution and outbound transportation costs is a result of lower inventory levels  the integration of our ohio and california furniture distribution operations into our regional distribution centers in july and  respectively  the renegotiation of dedicated carrier contracts with more favorable rates starting in august  more efficient operations due to increased volume of cartons  and the impact of decreased diesel fuel costs 
advertising expenses decreased due to renegotiated printing contracts with more favorable terms  reduced local advertising  and reduced newspaper distributions 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in the decrease of is primarily due to the effect of the increase in sales of as selling and administrative expense dollars increased as discussed above 
our future selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales rate is dependent upon many factors including our level of net sales  our ability to implement additional efficiencies  principally in our store and distribution center operations  and fluctuating commodity prices  such as diesel fuel  which directly affects our outbound transportation cost 
in  we expect expense leverage based on company specific initiatives to lower costs and the leveraging impact of our estimated comparable store sales increase of to 
we expect expense dollars to decrease in the areas of advertising  utilities  and health insurance based on certain company specific initiatives and program changes 
we estimate dollars will increase in store payroll  and distribution and transportation  however  the increase is forecasted to be at a lower rate than our estimated total sales growth of to 
additionally  we are forecasting slight deleverage in the areas of occupancy  depreciation  and equity related compensation expenses 
depreciation expense depreciation expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million for the decrease in depreciation expense was principally related to our stores and was due to assets becoming fully depreciated since the prior year 
many of these fully depreciated assets were placed in service in or and had five year estimated service lives 
compared to more recent years  capital expenditures were significantly higher in and  principally due to store remodels and a higher number of store openings in and for  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million 
using this assumption and the run rate of depreciation on our existing property and equipment  we expect depreciation expense to be million to million  which would represent an increase from the million of depreciation expense in interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was principally due to lower average borrowings including capital leases of million in compared to average borrowings of million in the higher average borrowings in were driven principally by the acquisition of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase programs which were completed in in  cash flow provided by operations was sufficient to repay the borrowings under the credit agreement in the fourth fiscal quarter 
our average effective interest rate of in was lower than our average effective interest rate of in the decrease in the average effective interest rate  which resulted from generally lower rates in the overall short term interest rate markets  decreased our interest expense by approximately million in interest and investment income interest and investment income increased million in to million compared to million in the increase in interest and investment income was caused by the increase in funds available to invest in compared to  partly offset by a decrease in investment yield 
our average invested amount in was million compared to million in in  we invested primarily in deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments  including money market funds and variable rate demand notes 
we held million of investments at the end of income taxes our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was for compared to for the net decrease in was primarily driven by the release of the valuation allowance on unrealized capital losses in contrast to an increase in the valuation allowance in we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be within a range of to 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations was million  net of tax  in compared to million  net of tax  in the loss from discontinued operations was primarily due to the kb ii bankruptcy lease obligations see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we obtained assignment of a lease for the former kb ii corporate office and recorded a charge of million  net of tax  in loss from discontinued operations 
the remaining million loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  in pertained to other kb ii bankruptcy lease obligations 
kb ii declared bankruptcy again in december as a result of this bankruptcy filing  kb ii rejected store leases for which we believe we have an indemnification obligation 
the loss from discontinued operations of million  net of tax  was comprised of million  net of tax  for the kb ii bankruptcy lease obligations and million  net of tax  for exit related costs on the remaining closed stores which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations 
compared to net sales net sales by merchandise category  as a percentage of total net sales  and net sales change in dollars and percentage in compared to were as follows change in thousands consumables    home    furniture    hardlines    seasonal    other    net sales   net sales decreased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in there were fewer open stores in which caused a decrease of million partially offset by our comparable store sales increase of  which increased sales by million 
our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of this calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria 
following a comparable store sales increase of in the first half of  sales trends softened resulting in a comparable store sales decrease of in the second half of we believe that our comparable store sales results in the third and fourth fiscal quarters were in part due to the worsening general economic trends 
from a merchandise perspective  the consumables  hardlines  and furniture categories net sales increased while net sales of home  other  and seasonal declined 
consumables continued its consistent sales growth throughout the year 
as the year progressed  consumers chose to seek out value when shopping for the everyday household use items that we offer in our consumables business 
we believe our strategy of offering name brands at competitive prices has led to this consistently positive net sales performance in the consumables category 
the hardlines category increase in net sales was driven by the availability in the second half of of multiple closeout deals containing higher ticket electronics  highlighted by significant values on items such as popular video games and personal computer laptops from national brand manufacturers 
the furniture category increase was driven by sales of mattresses  which were attributable to the customer response throughout the year especially when promotional pricing was coupled with holiday events such as the labor day mattress promotion 
the home category net sales consistently underperformed throughout the year continuing a trend which began in the first half of we believe our customers elected to defer purchases of this type of merchandise 
the other category sales decline is primarily due to lower sales of toys principally in the latter half of the year  when toys represent a relatively larger portion of our total net sales 
the lower toys sales results were partially offset within the other category by higher sales driven by closeout deals of licensed kids underwear during the first half of the year 
the seasonal category net sales produced positive results in the first half of the year for lawn garden and summer merchandise  however  the second half of the year s net sales underperformed due to lower comparable store sales for christmas  halloween  and harvest 
because the christmas selling season represents a higher portion of the total year s sales in this category  the decline in christmas merchandise sales drove the category sales lower for the year 
gross margin gross margin dollars increased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the increase in gross margin dollars was principally due to the higher gross margin rate  which increased gross margin dollars by approximately million 
partially offsetting the higher gross margin rate was lower net sales of million  which reduced gross margin dollars by approximately million 
the gross margin rate increase of basis points was primarily due to higher initial markup on merchandise and favorable shrink results partially offset by higher markdowns and the mix impact of our higher net sales in merchandise categories  such as consumables  that have lower gross margin rates 
the improvement in initial markup was due in part to a drugstore liquidation deal  a furniture closeout from a large national brand  and an overall favorable deal environment for closeout merchandise 
in addition  initial markup was higher in due to our home event  which we offered in our stores principally during the first half of the year 
the home event merchandise was included in the furniture category and home category 
shrink was lower principally due to favorable physical inventory results 
higher markdowns were attributable in part to planned markdowns associated with a drugstore liquidation deal  a furniture closeout from a large national brand  and our home event merchandise 
our inventory turnover improved to turns in compared to turns in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in the increase in selling and administrative expenses was principally caused by an increase in medical plan expenses of million  higher share based compensation expense of million  the partial recovery of the hcc note investment of million see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the hcc note  the reduction in selling and administrative expenses due to the receipt of insurance proceeds for hurricane claims of million  and higher store utilities of million 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs and a million decrease in store payroll costs 
the increase in medical plan expenses is principally due to higher paid claims 
the increase in share based compensation is principally due to our adoption of sfas no 
r under the modified prospective method of accounting in the first fiscal quarter of and our acceleration of vesting of stock options in the fourth fiscal quarter of higher store utilities costs were driven by colder weather this winter and higher average commodity rates throughout the majority of the decline in distribution and outbound transportation costs is a result of lower inventory levels  fewer cartons processed through our distribution centers as discussed above  more one way trips to the stores resulting in higher shipping cost per mile but fewer miles traveled and  beginning in july  the integration of our ohio furniture distribution operation into four of our regional distribution centers 
partially offsetting these favorable distribution and outbound transportation costs was the impact of higher diesel fuel prices 
store payroll is lower due to fewer stores and employees and fewer cartons of merchandise resulting from the million decline in net sales and the merchandise strategy that involves offering merchandise with slightly higher average item retails 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in excluding the impact of the million partial recovery of the hcc note and the receipt of hurricane insurance proceeds of million  both of which reduced selling and administrative expenses  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been approximately flat in compared to depreciation expense depreciation expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million for the decrease was principally related to the five year service life store remodel program assets that were placed in service in and and a lower level of capital expenditures in and the lower capital expenditures in and are principally related to opening seven stores in and stores in compared to opening   and stores in   and  respectively 
in addition  in and  we took a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development and installation of a new point of sale register system  which was installed in approximately stores in and in all of our remaining stores in as a result of the installation of the new point of sale register system  we reduced the estimated remaining service life on our old register system  effective the fourth fiscal quarter of the impact of this service life reduction was to recognize million in and million in as additional depreciation expense associated with the old cash registers 
interest expense interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was principally due to higher average borrowings of million in compared to average borrowings of million in the higher average borrowings caused interest expense to be higher by approximately million 
the higher average borrowings were driven principally by the acquisition of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase programs 
our average effective interest rate of in was lower than our average effective interest rate of in the decrease in the average effective interest rate  which resulted from generally lower rates in the overall short term interest rate markets  decreased our interest expense by approximately million in interest and investment income interest and investment income decreased million in to million compared to million in the decline in interest and investment income was caused by the reduction in funds available to invest in compared to our average invested amount in was million compared to million in the decline in funds available for investment was caused by the million of share repurchases under our share repurchase programs during the period march through february in  we invested primarily in money market type investments that were considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds 
we did not hold any investment balances at the end of income taxes our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was for compared to for the net increase in was driven by a decrease in nontaxable municipal interest income  the increase in the valuation allowance on unrealized capital losses versus a net decrease in the valuation allowance in  and a change in the jurisdictional earnings mix  partially offset by the settlement of certain income tax matters 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations was million  net of tax  in compared to income from discontinued operations of million  net of tax in the loss from discontinued operations of million  net of tax  was comprised of million  net of tax  for the kb ii bankruptcy lease obligation as defined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and million  net of tax  for exit related costs on the remaining closed stores which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations 
kb toys declared bankruptcy again in december as a result of this bankruptcy filing  kb toys rejected store leases for which we believe we have an indemnification obligation 
based on the lease data for these stores and using our prior experience with these matters  we estimated a kb ii bankruptcy lease obligation of million  net of tax 
the income from discontinued operations in was principally comprised of the release of our kb i bankruptcy lease obligations of million  net of tax  the recognition of million of proceeds  net of tax  from the bankruptcy trust as recovery for prior charges incurred by us for kb i bankruptcy lease obligations and the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center formerly owned by kb toys mortgage guarantee  and exit related costs on the closed stores of million  net of tax  related to expenses on the portion of the stores where the leases have not been terminated 
capital resources and liquidity on april   we entered into the credit agreement  a new million three year unsecured credit facility that replaced the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is scheduled to expire on april  in connection with our entry into the credit agreement  we paid an aggregate amount of million of bank fees and expenses  which are being amortized over the term of the agreement 
proceeds from borrowings under the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes  working capital  and to repay certain of our indebtedness 
the credit agreement includes a million letter of credit sublimit and a million swing loan sublimit 
the interest rates  pricing and fees under the credit agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating 
the credit agreement allows us to select our interest rate for each borrowing from two different interest rate options 
the interest rate options are generally derived from the prime rate or libor 
we may prepay revolving loans made under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on indebtedness  liens and investments  as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
a violation of any of the covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement that would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the credit agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the credit agreement 
as of january   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit agreement 
the primary sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations and  as necessary  borrowings under the credit agreement 
our net income and cash provided by operations are impacted by net sales volume  seasonal sales patterns  and operating profit margins 
our net sales are typically highest during the christmas selling season during our fourth fiscal quarter 
generally  our working capital requirements peak late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter 
we have typically funded those requirements with borrowings under our credit facility 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement and  after taking into account the reduction in availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling million  the borrowings available under the credit agreement were million 
we anticipate total indebtedness under the facility will be less than million through the end of june  all of which will be comprised of letters of credit  excluding any impact from the execution of the repurchase program 
in  our total indebtedness outstanding borrowings and letters of credit peaked at approximately million in early february under our credit agreement 
working capital was million at january  whenever our liquidity position requires us to borrow funds under the credit agreement  we typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis 
the daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position  which is generally driven by the following components of our operations cash inflows such as cash or credit card receipts collected from stores for merchandise sales and other miscellaneous deposits  and cash outflows such as check clearings for the acquisition of merchandise  payroll and other operating expenses  wire and other electronic transactions for merchandise purchases  income and other taxes  employee benefits  and other miscellaneous disbursements 
we use the credit agreement  as necessary  to provide funds for ongoing and seasonal working capital  capital expenditures  share repurchase programs  and other expenditures 
in addition  we use the credit agreement to provide letters of credit for various operating and regulatory requirements  a significant portion of which consists of letters of credit required as a result of our self funded insurance programs 
given the seasonality of our business  the amount of borrowings under the credit agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors  including our operating financial performance  the time of year  and our need to increase merchandise inventory levels prior to the peak selling season 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities of was principally due to higher net income and improved accounts payable leverage accounts payable divided by inventories 
accounts payable leverage improved due to the lower amount of inventories and our efforts to continue to work with our import and domestic vendors to further extend payment terms 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to the decline in accounts payable leverage as accounts payable decreased more than inventory decreased 
accounts payable decreased because of a shift in our merchandise mix to purchases from vendors with shorter payment terms  many of whom offered us cash discounts 
our cash paid for income taxes was million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
the increases in income taxes paid were a direct result of higher operating profits and partly impacted by the timing of required tax payments relative to the fiscal years in which these profits were earned 
our total contributions to the pension plan were million  million  and million in   and respectively 
these contributions were made to increase the funded level of the pension plan 
based on assumptions about our operating performance that we have discussed above in md a  we expect cash provided by operating activities to be approximately million in however  based on the current general economic conditions  consumers may elect to defer or forego purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news 
reduced consumer spending may reduce our net sales  which could lower our profitability and limit our ability to convert merchandise inventories to cash 
cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities of and the increase in cash used in investing activities of million was principally due to fluctuations in capital expenditures year from year 
the capital expenditures were driven by the investments in new store openings and the continued development of our sap for retail system 
the capital expenditures were driven by the investments in new store openings  our sap for retail system  which included development costs and additional payments for hardware and licensing fees  the completion of the installation of new cash registers in all of our stores  and the acquisition of two store properties that were previously leased 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in  comprised principally of maintenance capital of approximately million to million  real estate capital of approximately million to million driven by our plan to open new stores  and other investments of approximately million which include  among other things  capital to refresh stores  investment in energy management systems for stores  and our continued software development of the sap for retail system 
cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in  cash used in financing activities was principally due to the repayment of borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility of million and the payment of bank fees of million associated with our entry into the credit agreement  partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
in  cash used in financing activities was principally due to net payments on our prior bank credit facility of million and million of payments for treasury shares acquired under our november repurchase program  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
in december  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to million of our common shares 
no shares were repurchased under this program in on march   our board of directors authorized a million increase to our million program bringing the total authorization of the repurchase program to million 
on march   we utilized million of the authorization to execute an accelerated share repurchase transaction which reduced our common shares outstanding by million 
the total number of shares repurchased under the asr will be based upon the volume weighted average price of our stock over a predetermined period and will not be known until that period ends and a final settlement occurs 
the final settlement could increase or decrease the million shares initially reduced from our outstanding common shares 
the terms of the asr restrict us from declaring a dividend prior to its completion  which is currently scheduled to be no later than january  the remaining million will be utilized to repurchase shares in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion  subject to market conditions and other factors 
common shares acquired through the repurchase program will be available to meet obligations under equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes 
the repurchase program will continue until exhausted and will be funded with cash and cash equivalents  cash generated during fiscal or  if needed  by drawing on our million unsecured credit facility 
based on historical and expected financial results  we believe that we have or  if necessary  have the ability to obtain  adequate resources to fund ongoing and seasonal working capital requirements  proposed capital expenditures  new projects  and currently maturing obligations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at january  payments due by period less than more than total year to years to years years in thousands obligations under bank credit facility operating lease obligations     capital lease obligations    purchase obligations     other long term liabilities      total contractual obligations   the disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report 
those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate  consequently  the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur 
variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from the actually incurred include  but are not limited to the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration  fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation  the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report  fluctuations in third party fees  governmental charges  or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors  and the exercise of renewal options under  or the automatic renewal of  contracts that provide for the same 
obligations under bank credit facility consist of the borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
in addition  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million at january  approximately million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit  accordingly  they have been excluded from this table 
the remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in purchase obligations 
for a further discussion  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations include  among other items  leases for retail stores  warehouse space  data center  offices  and certain computer and other business equipment 
the future minimum commitments for retail store  data center  office  and warehouse space operating leases are million 
for a further discussion of leases  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for our applicable portion of cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
in connection with our store lease obligations  we estimated that future obligations for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance were million at january  we have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
those assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to use of historical data to estimate our future obligations  calculation of our obligations based on comparable store averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold  and assumptions related to average expected increases over historical data 
the remaining lease obligation of million relates primarily to operating leases for computer and other business equipment 
for purposes of the lease and purchase obligation disclosures  we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date  and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term  we disclosed in the table our minimum commitment under such obligation  such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term  due to the uncertainty of future decisions to exercise options to extend or terminate any existing leases 
purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at million  the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of january  in addition  we have a purchase commitment for future inventory purchases totaling million at january  while we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment  we have included  for purposes of this tabular disclosure  we have included the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods  as purchases that will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation 
the remaining million of purchase obligations is primarily related to distribution and transportation  information technology  print advertising  energy procurement  and other store security  supply  and maintenance commitments 
other long term liabilities include million for expected contributions to the pension plan and our nonqualified  unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan supplemental pension plan  million for obligations related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan  million for unrecognized tax benefits  and million for closed store lease termination costs 
pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans 
we have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions 
we have included unrecognized tax benefits of million for payments expected in and million of timing related income tax uncertainties anticipated to reverse in unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments 
our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms 
the obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities  guarantees  and indemnities related to the kb toys business 
for further discussion  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements for a discussion of the kb bankruptcy lease obligations  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
because the kb toys business filed for bankruptcy again in december and liquidated all of its store operations  we accrued a contingent liability on our balance sheet at january   in the amount of million for kb toys store leases for which we may have an indemnification or guarantee obligation and a former kb toys corporate office lease for which we took an assignment in because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability  our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  judgments  and assumptions  including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates  judgments  and assumptions on historical experience  current trends  and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates  judgments  and assumptions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies  including the recently adopted accounting standards and recent accounting standards future adoptions  are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period 
the average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear slow moving inventory  the estimated allowance for shrinkage  and the estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and prior or future gross margin 
these estimates are based on historical experience and current information 
when management determines the salability of merchandise inventories is diminished  markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made 
factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  the age of merchandise  and seasonal trends 
timing of holidays within fiscal periods  weather  and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year 
the inventory allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories  charged to cost of sales  and calculated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period 
such estimates are based on our historical and current year inventory results 
independent physical inventory counts are taken at each store once a year 
during  the majority of these counts occur between january and september 
as physical inventories are completed  actual results are recorded and new go forward shrink accrual rates are established based on individual store historical results 
thus  the shrink accrual rate will be adjusted throughout the january through september inventory cycle based on actual results 
at january   a difference in our shrink reserve would have affected gross margin  operating profit and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  we have loss prevention programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage 
long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment 
we perform annual impairment reviews of our long lived assets at the store level 
when we perform the annual impairment reviews  we first determine which stores had impairment indicators present 
we use actual historical cash flows to determine which stores had negative cash flows in each of the past two years on a rolling basis 
for each store with two years of negative cash flows  we obtain future cash flow estimates based on operating performance estimates specific to each store s operations that are based on assumptions currently being used to develop our company level operating plans 
if the net book value of a store s long lived assets is not recoverable by the expected future cash flows of the store  we estimate the fair value of the store s assets and recognize an impairment charge for the excess net book value of the store s long lived assets over their fair value 
the fair value of store assets is estimated based on information available in the marketplace for similar assets 
we recognized impairment charges of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we believe that our impairment charges are trending lower because we closed a number of underperforming stores at the end of  and continued to close primarily through non renewal of leases underperforming stores in   and we only identified four stores with impairment indicators as a result of our annual store impairment tests in and we recognized impairment charges on those stores 
therefore  we do not believe that varying the assumptions used to test for recoverability to estimate fair value of our long lived assets would have a material impact on the impairment charges we incurred in however  if our future operating results decline significantly  we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material for additional discussion of this risk  see item a 
risk factors a significant decline in our operating profit and taxable income may impair our ability to realize the value of our long lived assets and deferred tax assets 
in addition to our annual store impairment reviews  we evaluate our long lived assets at each reporting period to determine whether impairment indicators are present 
in  we recorded impairment to the assets of one store as a result of a casualty loss due to hurricane damage 
the amount of this impairment is included in the million impairment charge discussed above 
share based compensation we grant stock options and performance based non vested restricted stock to our employees under shareholder approved incentive plans 
share based compensation expense was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in share based compensation is primarily due to our acceleration of vesting of restricted stock grants based on our profit performance in  and future share based compensation expense for performance based non vested restricted stock is dependent upon the future number of awards  fair value of our common shares on the grant date  and the estimated vesting period 
future share based compensation expense for stock options is dependent upon the number and terms of future stock option awards and many estimates  judgments and assumptions used in arriving at the fair value of stock options 
future share based compensation expense related to performance based non vested restricted stock and stock options may vary materially from the currently amortizing awards 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using a binomial model 
the binomial model takes into account estimates  assumptions  and judgments about our stock price volatility  our dividend yield rate  the risk free rate of return  the contractual term of the option  the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life  and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
expected volatility is based on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares 
the dividend yield rate on our common shares is assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no immediate plans to do so 
the risk free rate is based on us treasury security yields at the time of the grant 
the expected life is determined from the application of the binomial model and includes assumptions such as the expected employee exercise behavior and our expected turnover rate  which is based on analysis of historical data 
compensation expense for performance based non vested restricted stock awards is recorded over the estimated vesting period based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria 
an estimated target achievement date is determined at the time of the award based on historical and forecasted performance of similar measures 
we monitor the achievement of the performance targets at each reporting period and make adjustments to the estimated vesting period when our internal models indicate that the estimated achievement date differs from the date being used to amortize expense 
any change in the estimated vesting date results in a prospective change to the related expense by charging the remaining unamortized expense over the remaining expected vesting period at the date the estimate was changed 
income taxes the determination of our income tax expense  refunds receivable  income taxes payable  deferred tax assets and liabilities and financial statement recognition  de recognition and or measurement of uncertain tax benefits for positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex accounting and multi jurisdictional income tax laws 
the effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income loss before income taxes  the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income loss  changes in the income tax laws which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year  subsequent recognition  de recognition and or measurement of an uncertain tax benefit  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence including recent financial results  projected future pretax accounting income from continuing operations and tax planning strategies when necessary 
this evaluation requires us to make assumptions that require significant judgment about the forecasts of future pretax accounting income 
the assumptions that we use in this evaluation are consistent with the assumptions and estimates used to develop our consolidated operating financial plans 
if we determine that a portion of our deferred tax assets  which principally represent expected future deductions or benefits  are not likely to be realized  we recognize a valuation allowance for our estimate of these benefits which we believe are not likely recoverable 
additionally  changes in tax laws  apportionment of income for state tax purposes  and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the uncertainty of income tax positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns 
when a tax position meets the more likely than not threshold  we recognize economic benefits associated with the position on our consolidated financial statements 
the more likely than not recognition threshold is a positive assertion that an enterprise believes it is entitled to economic benefits associated with a tax position 
when a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold  or in the case of those positions that do meet the threshold but are measured at less than the full benefit taken on the return  we recognize tax liabilities or de recognize tax assets  as the case may be 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have derecognized a tax benefit  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively or ultimately settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or as a result of the evaluation of new information that becomes available 
pension actuarial valuations are used to calculate the estimated expenses and obligations for our pension plan and supplemental pension plan 
inherent in the actuarial valuations are several assumptions including discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
we review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return 
our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date 
in making this estimate  we review rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is derived from detailed periodic studies  which include a review of asset allocation strategies  anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  risks standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plan s asset mix 
while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  the assumption is primarily a long term  prospective rate of return 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for was 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase net periodic pension cost by million 
the long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in was 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
during  we reclassified million  net of tax  from other comprehensive income to expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we recognized a benefit of million  net of tax  to other comprehensive income in  principally as a result of the increase in value of investments held by the pension trust 
as of january   the accumulated other comprehensive income amount  which was principally unrealized actuarial loss  was million loss  net of tax 
during  and in future periods  we expect to reclassify approximately million from other comprehensive income to expense  assuming we achieve our estimated rate of return on pension plan investments in future periods 
additionally  in the event that we have future settlement events  as occurred in and  we would expect that the expense related to future settlements would be greater than the million and million charges in and  respectively 
insurance and insurance related reserves we are self insured for certain losses relating to property  general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical and dental benefit claims  a portion of which is funded by employees 
we purchase stop loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposure in these areas 
accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity 
management makes estimates  judgments  and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially based calculations  including but not limited to  estimated health care cost trends  estimated lag time to report and pay claims  average cost per claim  network utilization rates  network discount rates  and other factors 
a change in our self insured liabilities at january  would have affected selling and administrative expenses  operating profit  and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value  using a discount rate  while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted 
a change in the discount rate on these liabilities would have affected selling and administrative expenses  operating profit  and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
lease accounting in order to recognize rent expense on our leases  we evaluate many factors to identify the lease term such as the contractual term of the lease  our assumed possession date of the property  renewal option periods  and the estimated value of leasehold improvement investments that we are required to make 
based on this evaluation  our lease term is typically the minimum contractually obligated period over which we have control of the property 
this term is used because although many of our leases have renewal options  we typically do not incur an economic or contractual penalty in the event of non renewal 
therefore  we typically use the initial minimum lease term for purposes of calculating straight line rent  amortizing deferred rent  and recognizing depreciation expense on our leasehold improvements 
commitments for a discussion of commitments  refer to note  note  note  and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates on investments and on borrowings under the credit agreement that we make from time to time 
we had no borrowings at january  under the credit agreement 
an increase of in our variable interest rate on our investments and expected future borrowings would not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity
