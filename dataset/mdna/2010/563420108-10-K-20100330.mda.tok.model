historically  the demand for the company s products has depended upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which the company competes 
the company s sales depend in part upon its customers replacement or repair cycles 
adverse economic conditions  including a decrease in commodity prices  typically causes our customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery 
beginning in september of  the united states and world financial markets came under unprecedented stress 
the immediate impact was a dramatic decrease in liquidity and credit availability throughout the world 
an incredibly rapid and significant deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe followed 
these events had an immediate significant adverse impact on the company  including a very dramatic curtailment of new orders  requests to delay deliveries and  in some cases to cancel existing orders 
the deterioration in economic conditions is ongoing and the ultimate extent of the current recession and the timing of the recovery is unknown 
the actions of the united states and other world governments to stimulate the world economy are also unprecedented 
the united states stimulus package includes very significant appropriations for improving the country s infrastructure  which could be a significant benefit to the company 
the ultimate success of governmental actions and the resulting benefits that the company may see  however  remain unknown 
in response to the impact of economic conditions and longer sales cycles  it was determined that swift management action was necessary to ensure that operating activity was balanced with current demand levels 
since the end of the third quarter  we have implemented across the board cost reductions 
the specific actions taken to achieve these cost reductions comprise headcount reductions of salaried and hourly employees  virtual elimination of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in executive and salaried pay  bonus and benefits and the introduction of shortened work weeks 
management believes that these actions  although difficult  are required to enable the company to adjust to current conditions and position it to respond quickly when the market recovers 
certain of the aforementioned actions were implemented before december  significant additional steps were implemented shortly after year end december  the company continued to monitor its cost structure and made some additional adjustments during restructuring costs were 
million and million for and  respectively

gross profit as a percent of revenues was for the year ended december  excluding the effect of the badger  crane and schaeff acquisitions revenues would have decreased million  as badger had revenues of million and crane and schaeff had revenues of million and million for the nine months ended september   respectively 
our fourth quarter results for both and included revenues for crane and schaeff operations as these two operations were acquired on october  the decrease in revenues is attributed to the unprecedented stress in the world financial markets and the significant deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe that followed 
the company has experienced significant decreases in revenues across all its commercial product lines 
however  our revenue from military sales  which have historically fluctuated significantly from year to year  were up over in our military related revenues in total comprised approximately of total revenues 
the overall decrease in revenues is overwhelmingly due to a decrease in unit sales of the company s heavy equipment products 
part sales which traditionally account for approximately of total revenues have been adversely impacted 
the percentage decrease in part sales was  however  not as severe as it was for unit sales 
part sales as a percent of total revenues increased to in from in the prior year 
although boom truck revenues were down dramatically in  due to an overall market conditions  we were encouraged to see that our market share for boom trucks our most significant product continues to increase 
our market share for boom trucks increased to for from in and in 
table of contents additionally  orders with a total value of million  which were shipped predominately in october and november  were not included in our revenues  as we would have expected 
these particular items were shipped fob destination and had not been received by the customer as of december  and as such could not be included in revenues 
the customer  an international agency  purchased the items and had us ship the units to remote locations  which accounted for the extremely long delivery times 
the units have now been received by the customers and will be included in our first quarter revenues 
gross profit as a percent of net revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period  an improvement of 
this improvement is attributed to a significant improvement in our margin for material handling products and the favorable effect that the crane and schaeff acquisition had on our gross margin percent 
the improvement in forklift specialized carrier margin percent is due to restructuring activities that occurred during the second half of and the first quarter of  a weakening of the canadian dollar  and a favorable product mix the result of increased military business 
crane and schaeff margins were high as part sales accounted for a very significant portion of their revenues 
part sales across all product lines have higher margins 
our crane products gross margin percent for decreased slightly from the prior year less than as our restructuring initiatives and other cost savings measures did not fully offset the effect of a change in mix towards lower tonnage cranes and the decrease in volume 
restructuring expenses during the third quarter of  the company began to restructure the manufacturing processes at its manitex liftking facility with the objective of improving production efficiencies and lowering our costs 
the company began to experience the benefits of the staffing reductions in the fourth quarter of an evaluation of the current staffing has been completed and as a result  the workforce was reduced by employees to align the size of our workforce to our current production requirements 
in connection with the reduction in force  the company was required to pay terminated employees million in severance  which has been included in operating expense and is shown in the income statement on a line entitled restructuring expenses 
we began to experience the effects of the current economic recession in september of  which resulted in a dramatic curtailment of our new orders  requests to delay deliveries and  in some cases to cancellation of existing orders 
in response to these adverse economic conditions and longer sales cycles  management took action to balance its operations with decreased demand levels 
the specific actions taken to achieve these cost reductions included headcount reductions of salaried and hourly employees  virtual elimination of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in executive and salaried pay  bonus and benefits and the introduction of shortened workweeks 
these actions  although difficult  were required to enable the company to adjust to current conditions and position it to respond quickly when the market recovers 
certain of the aforementioned actions were implemented before december  significant additional steps were implemented shortly after year end and still other additional staff reductions occurred during the remainder of the following is summary of staff reductions and restructuring expenses severance payments year ended december  year ended december  staff reduction severance average staff reduction severance average normal course thousand thousand related to economic conditions thousand thousand thousand thousand total thousand thousand thousand thousand canadian law requires that a minimum severance based on years of service be paid to terminated employees 
as a result  it is generally more costly to terminate an employee in canada 
as expected the average severance costs for our manitex liftking facility located in ontario  canada are higher 

table of contents additionally  the company is focused on several new north american and international sales initiatives and supply chain cost reduction initiatives which are designed to continue market share gains  and to improve margins and profitability 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the comparable period in corporate expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative  excluding corporate expenses  decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
excluding the effect of the badger  crane and schaeff acquisitions selling  general and administrative expense excluding corporate expenses would have decreased million  as badger had expenses of million and crane and schaeff had expenses of million and million for the nine months ended september   respectively 
our fourth quarter results for both and included selling  general and administrative expenses for the crane and schaeff operations as these two operations were acquired on october  a decrease in compensation expenses  including commissions  account for approximately of the decrease 
the decrease in compensation expenses is attributed to headcount reductions of salaried and hourly employees  virtual elimination of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in salaried pay  and benefits and the introduction of shortened workweeks as well as the impact that lower sales had on commissions 
a decrease in show expenses and travel account for another of the decrease 
show and travel expenses were down in part because included costs of approximately million related to our participation in the con expo trade show in march the con expo show  which is held every three years  was held in las vegas from march to march  this show is an international gathering place for the construction industries 
the remaining decrease is due a number of other factors including a decrease in legal expense and lower average canadian exchange rate for corporate expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in approximately of the decrease is related to decreased compensation costs  the result of salary reductions  elimination of bonuses and lower stock related compensation  as the company did not make any stock grants in the remainder of the decrease is related to decreases in several expense items including decrease in legal costs  recruiting fees  lower d o insurance premiums and a decrease in public relation expenses 
gain on bargain purchases the results for includes gains on bargain purchases of and  recorded in connection with the badger and load king acquisitions  respectively 
in accordance with asc  any excess of fair value of acquired net assets over the acquisition consideration results in a bargain purchase in accordance with acquisition method of accounting  any resulting gain on bargain purchase must be recognized in earnings on the acquisition date 
the gains on bargain purchases are disclosed on a separate line in the company consolidated statement of operations for year ended december see note in the consolidated financial statements for additional details concerning the gain 
operating income the company  had operating income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
adjusting operating income to exclude the gains on bargain purchases would have resulted in an adjusted operating loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease in operating income  excluding gains on bargain purchases  is entirely attributed to a decrease in revenues as the gross profit percent improved by to for from for and operating expenses decreased by million excluding the gain on bargain purchases 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest is due to lower interest rates through july  the prime rate decreased in several increments from at january  to at december  the prime rate remained unchanged at for the entire year ended december  the company benefits from lower interest rates as a significant portion of our debt is indexed to the prime rate 

table of contents however  on july  the company and its bank amended the revolving credit facility  the revolving canadian credit facility and its term loan 
under the agreements the maturity dates were extended from april  to april  in connection with the extension  the company agreed to increased interest rates 
the interest on us borrowing increased from prime rate plus 
to prime plus  interest rates on canadian borrowings increased from canadian prime rate plus to canadian prime rate plus  and interest on its term loan increased from the prime rate plus to the prime rate plus 
the effect of the aforementioned increases in interest rates was offset by a decrease in the prime rate 
modestly higher average outstanding debt for compared to average outstanding debt for partially offset the effect of lower interest rates for the first six months 
the increase in average debt is attributed to acquisition debt related to crane  schaeff acquired october  and badger acquired july  which was partially offset by lower balances on credit lines  our term debt and the manitex liftking acquisition note 
foreign currency transaction gains and loss the company attempts to purchase forward currency exchange contracts such that the exchange gains and losses on the assets and liabilities denominated in other than the reporting units functional currency will be offset by the changes in the market value of the forward currency exchange contracts it holds 
the company records at the balance sheet date the forward currency exchange contracts at their market value with any associated gain or loss being recorded in current earnings as a currency gain or loss 
the foreign currency transaction gain for the year ended december  was million and the foreign currency loss was million for the year ended december  the aforementioned foreign currency gain or loss is net of forward currency contracts gains and losses 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax benefit is primarily related to the reversal in valuation allowance related to the change in realizability of the company s deferred tax assets  as deferred tax liabilities were recorded in connection with the badger and load king acquisition 
the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to the current utilization of prior year losses for which no benefit was previously received and a tax benefit related to a discrete item for the recognition of a deferred tax asset for the texas temporary margin tax credit as a result of a resolution of an income tax examination net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million 
this compares with a net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  of million 
discontinued operations for the year ended december   discontinued operations reported net income of million 
for  discontinued operations had income resulting from the reversal of a million warranty reserve as it was determined that it was not needed and a million payment received related to the settlement of a contract dispute 
additionally  the company recorded a gain of million on the sale or closure of a discontinued operation 
the gain resulted from the reversal a reserve for termination of contracts  as it was determined that it was not needed 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the results for acquisitions have been included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations from the date of their respective acquisition  ie  july  for the noble product line acquisition and october  for the crane and schaeff acquisition 
as a result includes a full year of results for the noble product line and three months for the crane and schaeff acquisition

gross profit as a percent of sales was for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net revenue and gross profit were million and million  respectively 
gross profit as a percent of revenues was for the year ended december  net revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable year period in revenue for was increased by approximately million by having a full year of noble product line revenues in and having three months of crane and schaeff revenues 
noble product line revenues increased approximately million while crane and schaeff contributed an additional million 
revenues would have decreased approximately million without the additional revenues generated by the noble product line  crane and schaeff 
the decrease is the result of a decrease in sales of forklifts and specialized carriers  which was partially offset by million increase in crane sales 
the increase in crane sales is attributed to an increase in chassis sales 
the company builds cranes on chassis supplied by the customer or by the company 
the increase in chassis sales is the result of a substantial sales increase to a particular distributor  who has elected to have the manitex subsidiary supply the chassis 
the majority of the decrease in forklift specialized carrier sales is due to decrease in the sales of military forklifts 
a decrease in the sale of commercial rough terrain forklifts  the result of the slowing north american economy  and a decrease in special carriers also contributed to the sales decline 
the decrease in military forklifts sales is attributed to the timing of governmental orders 
gross profit as a percent of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period  an erosion of 
the decrease in margin percent is due to a decrease in the gross margin percent for crane products which was offset by a modest increase in the gross margin for forklifts and specialized carriers 
the decrease in crane product margins was caused by a significant increase in the cost of raw materials and components 
although we experienced material price increases over the first half of the year  these were not nearly of the magnitude that we experienced starting late in the second quarter and into the third quarter 
through the second quarter of  increases in material prices were largely offset by increases in the sale of cranes with higher lifting capacity which have higher gross margins  the benefit of sourcing materials from lower cost countries  a price increase that was instituted in mid year and an improvement in 
table of contents production efficiencies 
it became clear during the third quarter of that these rapidly accelerating material price increases were going to continue and would adversely impact the company s margins 
in june   the company announced its annual price increases for all new orders received on or after july st 
the company continued to honor old prices on its existing backlog 
as such  the benefit from the price increase did not occur until late or early t 
to further offset the effect of price increases  the company instituted a to surcharge on cranes shipped in the later part of the fourth quarter the forklift specialized carrier product line margin as percentage of net revenue increased modestly 
although the cost of materials for forklifts specialized carriers also increased  the effect was more than offset by a restructuring initiative that occurred early in the third quarter of  the elimination of start up of inefficiencies for the noble product line and the weakening of the canadian dollar  which positively impacted margins on us dollar sales 
restructuring expenses during the third quarter of  the company began to restructure the manufacturing processes at its manitex liftking facility with the objective of improving production efficiencies and lowering our costs 
the company began to experience the benefits of the staffing reductions in the fourth quarter of an evaluation of the current staffing was completed and as a result  the workforce was reduced by employees to align the size of our workforce to our production requirements

in response to the impact of economic conditions and longer sales cycles  it was determined that swift management action was necessary to ensure that operating activity was balanced with current demand levels 
since the end of the third quarter  we have implemented across the board cost reduction activities that we estimate will yield approximately million in annual expense reductions 
the specific actions taken to achieve these cost reductions comprise headcount reductions of salaried and hourly employees  virtual elimination of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in executive and salaried pay  bonus and benefits and the introduction of shortened workweeks 
these actions  although difficult  are required to enable the company to adjust to current conditions and position it to respond quickly when the market recovers 
certain of the aforementioned actions were implemented before december  significant additional steps were implemented shortly after year end 
restructuring expense severance payments related to actions taken before year end was approximately million

selling  general and administrative  excluding corporate expenses  increased million to million including million for crane and schaeff for the year ended december  from million for the comparable year period in without the additional costs from the crane and schaeff acquisition  selling  general administrative expenses would have increased million 
the increase is principally due to an increase in selling expenses for our manitex subsidiary and an increase in management resources for our manitex liftking subsidiary 
the increase in selling expense at our manitex subsidiary is related to costs of approximately 
table of contents million associated with participating in the con expo trade show in march the con expo show  which is held every three years  was held in las vegas from march to march  this show is an international gathering place for the construction industries 
it is estimated that  professionals from around the world attended the show 
the increase in manitex liftking management is principally related to hiring additional management personnel 
modest offsetting variances in a number of other lines resulted in a small net decrease in expense 
corporate expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the decrease is principally attributed to a decrease in management bonuses  consulting expenses and legal fees 
legal expenses were higher in in part as they were incurred in conjunction with the sec review of the s registration statement  which was filed on december  and declared effective on september  consulting expenses were higher in as a consultant was assisting the company in meeting its initial year sarbanes oxley requirements 
operating income operating income from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  was equivalent to of net revenues compared to an operating income of million for the year ended december  or of net revenues 
the decrease in operating income as percentage of net revenues is primarily due to a decrease of in the gross margin percentage 
additionally  restructuring expense of million and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million accounts for approximately and of the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net revenues 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest is due to a decrease in average outstanding debt for versus average outstanding debt for and lower interest rates

and on our canadian line from canadian prime plus to canadian prime plus for canadian dollar borrowings 
foreign currency transaction loss as a result of the currency losses incurred in the second quarter  the company investigated ways to mitigate future foreign currency risk 
historically the usd cdn exchange rate has not seen such volatility in a short time period and the company had not taken any action to mitigate its foreign exchange exposures 
as a result of its investigation  the company began purchasing forward exchange contracts beginning in september of the company endeavors to purchase forward currency exchange contracts such that the exchange gains and losses on the assets and liabilities denominated in other than the reporting units functional currency will be offset by the changes in the market value of the forward currency exchange contracts it holds

the foreign currency transaction loss for the year ended december  was million 
the exchange losses were principally incurred before the company entered into the forward currency exchange contracts in early september the foreign currency loss was driven by a historically unusual strengthening of the canadian dollar during the six months ended september   when the us to canadian dollar exchange rate changed from 
to 
the company had an acquisition note payable for million to the former 
table of contents owner of liftking industries  which is denominated in canadian dollars

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in excluding the effect of the badger  and schaeff acquisitions revenues would have decreased million  as badger had revenues of million and schaeff had revenues of million for the nine months ended september   respectively 
our fourth quarter results for both and had revenues for schaeff as it was acquired on october  the decrease in revenues is attributed to the unprecedented stress in the world financial markets and the significant deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe that followed 
the company has experienced significant decreases in revenues across all its commercial product lines 
however  our military revenues  which have historically fluctuated significantly from year to year  were up over in the governmental related revenues in total comprised approximately of the segment s revenues 
the overall decrease in revenues is overwhelmingly due to a decrease in unit sales of the company s heavy equipment products 
part sales have also been adversely impacted 
the percentage decrease in part sales was  however  not as severe as it was for unit sales 
although boom truck revenues were down dramatically in  due to overall market conditions  we were encouraged to see that our market share for boom trucks our most significant product continues to increase 
our market share for boom trucks increased to for from in and in additionally  orders with a total value of million  which were shipped predominately in october and november  were not included in our revenues  as we would have expected 
these particular items were shipped fob destination and had not been received by the customer as of december  and as such could not be included in revenues

adjusting operating income to exclude the gains on bargain purchases would resulted in an adjusted operating income of million or of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income as a percentage of net revenues is entirely due to a decrease in revenue as the gross margin percent improved by approximately 
this improvement is attributed to a significant improvement in our margin for material handling products and favorable effect that the schaeff acquisition had on our gross margin percent 
the improvement in forklift specialized carrier margin percent is due to restructuring activities that occurred during the second half of and during the first quarter  to a weakening of the canadian dollar  and a favorable product mix the result of increased military business 
schaeff margins were high as part sales accounted for a very significant portion of their revenues 
part sales across all product lines have higher margins 
our crane products gross margin percent for decreased slightly from the prior year less than as our restructuring initiatives and other cost savings measures did not fully offset the effect of a change in mix towards lower tonnage cranes and the decrease in volume 
the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease of million in operating expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in revenue for was increased by approximately million by having a full year of noble product line revenues in and having three months of schaeff revenues 
noble product line revenues increased approximately million while schaeff contributed an additional million 
revenues would have decreased approximately million without the additional revenues generated by the noble product line  and schaeff 
the decrease is the result of a decrease in sales of forklifts and specialized carriers  which was partially offset by million increase in crane sales 
the increase in crane sales is attributed to an increase in chassis sales 
the company builds cranes on chassis supplied by the 
table of contents customer or by the company 
the increase in chassis sales is the result of a substantial sales increase to a particular distributor  who has elected to have the manitex subsidiary supply the chassis 
the majority of the decrease in forklift specialized carrier sales is due a decrease in the sales of military forklifts 
a decrease in the sale of commercial rough terrain forklifts  the result of the slowing north american economy  and a decrease in special carriers also contributed to the sales decline

the delay in receipt also delayed payment by the customer  which contributed to the increase in borrowings 
during the first quarter  the customer both received and paid for the units 
we expect the availability under the canadian credit facility will increase significantly during the second quarter of and may reach million 
the increase in availability is delayed or slowed because the collateral under 
table of contents the canadian credit facility exceeds the maximum amount of the facility 
we expect the excess collateral will go away as units are sold and paid for during the first and second quarters of during  the company increased its debt by million to million from million

future availability under credit facilities both the us and canadian credit facilities are asset based 
the maximum the company may borrow under either facility is the lower of the credit line or the available collateral  as defined in the credit agreements 
collateral under the agreement consists of stated percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
beginning in september  the financial markets in the united states and globally came under incredible stress 
a substantial deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe followed 
as a result  the company has seen a significant contraction in its business  which continued through this contraction resulted in a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory balances excluding acquisitions  which had the effect of lowering the maximum amount that can be borrowed under the company s credit facilities 
the amount needed to finance working capital has also decreased  which resulted in a reduced outstanding balance under the company s credit facilities 
the availability under the credit facility at any point is the difference between the available collateral and the outstanding balance under the credit facility 
in response to the impact of economic conditions and longer sales cycles  it was determined that swift management action was necessary to ensure that operating activity was balanced with current demand levels 
since the end of the third quarter  we have implemented across the board cost reductions 
the specific actions taken to achieve these cost reductions comprise headcount reductions of salaried and hourly employees  virtual elimination of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in executive and salaried pay  bonus and benefits and the introduction of shortened workweeks 
management believes that these actions  although difficult  are required to enable the company to adjust to current conditions and position it to respond quickly when the market recovers 
certain of the aforementioned actions were implemented before december  significant additional steps were implemented shortly after year end december  the company  however  continued to monitor its cost structure and made some additional adjustment during the aforementioned actions decreased our cash requirements 

table of contents as stated above  the company had million and million available on its us and canadian credit facilities as of december  at december   our canadian subsidiary  however  had collateral of cdn million 
the maximum our canadian subsidiary could borrow  however  was capped at cdn million the excess collateral will be reduced during the first quarter of as receivables are collected and inventory is sold 
this will result in both a significant increase in availability under the canadian credit facility and a reduction in accounts payable 
the company needs cash to meet its working capital needs as the business grows  to acquire capital equipment  and to fund acquisitions and debt repayment 
we intend to use cash flows from operations and existing availability under the current revolving credit facilities to fund anticipated levels of operations for approximately the next months 
as outlined above  management has to ensure that operating activity is balanced with current demand levels and has reduced operating costs dramatically  and as a result management believes that its two credit facilities will provide sufficient working capital 
however  the length and severity of the current business contraction is not known  we cannot say with certainty that cash generated from operations will be adequate or that the credit facilities will have sufficient availability to bridge any short fall 
the longer the business contraction lasts or deeper it becomes the greater the risk 
we will likely need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings to support our growth strategy  which may include additional acquisitions 
there is no assurance that such financing will be available or  if available  on acceptable terms 
operating activities generated million of cash for the year ended december   and is comprised of net earnings of million  a decrease in working capital of million offset by negative non cash items of million 
amortization and depreciation of million  a non cash charge and source of cash  was more than offset by the million non cash gain on bargain purchases and the increase in deferred taxes of million  which is primarily related to the reversal in valuation allowance related to the change in realizability of the company s deferred tax assets  as deferred tax liabilities were recorded in connection with the badger and load king acquisition 
the decrease in working capital results primarily from a decrease in accounts receivables of million offset by increases in inventory of million  prepaid expenses of million  other assets of million and decreases in accounts payable of million  accrued expense of million and other current liabilities of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable are attributed to the significant decrease in revenues from to inventory did not decrease primarily because it included finished goods related to a million sale which were shipped fob destination predominately in october and november 
the units were still in inventory as the units had not been received by the customer at december  the customer  an international agency  purchased the items and had us ship the units to remote locations  which accounted for the extremely long delivery times 
the increase in prepaid expense and the decrease in accrued items in part is the result of having a tax receivable and a receivable related to forward currency contracts in as opposed to liabilities for these two items in the remaining decrease in accrued expense is the result of the decrease in revenues and the associated reductions in items such as accrued warranty  bonuses  commissions  etc

the non cash items are principally composed of amortization and depreciation of million  non cash expense for stock based compensation of million offset by an increase in deferred tax assets of million 
the increase in working capital results primarily from an increase in accounts receivables of million  an increase in inventory of million  and a decrease in accrued expenses of million  and other changes that consumed million offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses of million  the increase in receivables is attributed to a slowing of payments from our customer attributed to the distress in the financial markets 
in particular  several of our dealers were financed by ge capital  who had a moratorium on funding their existing customer credit lines from the beginning of december until early january 
approximately of increase in inventory is accounted for by an increase in finished goods 
the increase in finished goods inventory is primarily the result of the company having a greater number of finished boom trucks  sky cranes  rough terrain cranes and fuchs material handlers in inventory at december  the increase in cranes at end of is due to the contraction of business referred to above and an associated longer selling cycle 
the balance of the increase in inventory is due to an increase in raw materials 
the company had open purchase commitment  when the sudden business contraction occurred at the end of the third quarter 
purchases were cancelled or receipts were delayed when possible  but this was not always possible 
the decrease in accrued expenses is due to changes in a number of items  the most significant were a decrease in accrued bonuses of million and a decrease of million in accrued warranty 
the decrease in accrued bonuses is the result of bonuses being lower in the decrease in accrued warranty is related to our increased efforts to improve initial quality and an increased emphasis on charging back warranty claims to our vendors 
the increase in accounts payable is due to increased purchases and a slowing of payment to vendors 
the decrease in prepaid expense is related to a decrease in deposit made on future inventory purchases

the company capitalizes certain costs related to patent technology 
additionally  a substantial portion of the purchase price related to the company s acquisitions has been assigned to patents or unpatented technology  trade name  customer backlog  and customer relationships 
under the guidance  other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition  is reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets exceed their fair value 
the company does not amortize goodwill  in accordance with financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
the company selected october as the date for the required annual impairment test 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information with similar economic characteristics is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by the company s management 
the company s two operating segments comprise the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment using a business valuation method  which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free  after tax projected future cash flows  discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
the market approach was also considered in evaluating the potential for impairment by calculating fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable  publicly traded companies 
this analysis also did not indicate impairment 
moreover  we also observed implied ebitda multiples from relatively recent merger and acquisition activity in the industry  which was used to test the reasonableness of the results the determination of fair value requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  revenue growth and operating earnings projections  discount rates  terminal growth rates  and required capital expenditure projections 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with our projections may ultimately result in a future impairment 
in the event we determine that goodwill is impaired in the future  we would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge 

table of contents during the fourth quarter and as of december   our market capitalization was below book value 
while the market capitalization was considered in our evaluation of fair value  the market metric is only one indicator of fair value 
it has been our opinion that the market capitalization approach is not a reliable indicator of the value for the company  either now or in the past 
our conclusion is based on the fact that trading volume on our stock is very limited  the company does not provide guidance nor is there is any significant analyst coverage 
furthermore  very modest sized trades can impact the stock price significantly because our trading volume is so low 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
impairment of long lived assets the company s policy is to assess the realizability of its long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions for future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
the company did not have any impairment for the years ended december  and warranty expense 
the company establishes reserve for future warranty expense at point when revenue is recognized by the company and is based on percentage of revenues 
the provision for estimated warranty claims  which is included in cost of sales  is based on sales 
litigation claims 
in determining whether liabilities should be recorded for pending litigation claims  the company must assess the allegations and the likelihood that it will successfully defend itself 
when the company believes it is probable that it will not prevail in a particular matter  it will then make an estimate of the amount of liability based  in part  on the advice of outside legal counsel 
deferred income taxes 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in our most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years as cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
at december   and  we provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets based on our cumulative losses in recent years  except for certain state tax credits 
computation of earnings per share 
basic earnings per share eps was computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
the number of shares related to options  warrants  restricted stock and similar instruments included in diluted eps eps is based on the treasury stock method 
this method assumes theoretical repurchase of shares using proceeds of the respective stock option or warrant exercised  and for restricted stock the amount of 
table of contents compensation cost attributed to future services which has not yet been recognized and the amount of current and deferred tax benefit  if any  that would be credited to additional paid in capital upon the vesting of the restricted stock at a price equal to the issuer s average stock price during the related earnings period 
accordingly  the number of shares includable in the calculation of eps in respect of the stock options  warrants  restricted stock and similar instruments is dependent on this average stock price and will increase as the average stock price increases 
securities of a subsidiary that were convertible into its parent company s common stock were considered among potential common shares of the parent company for the purposes of computing consolidated diluted eps until conversion occurred 
business combinations 
the company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with guidance found in asc  business combinations 
the guidance  effective january   requires consideration given  including contingent consideration  assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be valued at their fair market values at the acquisition date 
the guidance further provides that in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset  acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
asc requires that any excess of purchase price over fair value of assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill 
in accordance with asc  any excess of fair value of acquired net assets  including identifiable intangibles assets  over the acquisition consideration results in a bargain purchase gain 
prior to recording a gain  the acquiring entity must reassess whether all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re measurements to verify that the consideration paid  assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been properly valued

a revision of business combinations guidance which was later codified under asc  business combinations 
the revised guidance retains the underlying concepts that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but changes the application of the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
in april  the fasb issued further guidance which clarifies the initial and subsequent recognition  subsequent accounting  and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this requires that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period 
if the acquisition date fair value of an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liability would be measured at the amount that would be recognized based on guidance in asc  contingencies  which provides thresholds for recognition based on probability and the ability to reasonably estimate an amount or range of amounts 
this guidance was effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   which  for the company  was january  as discussed in note acquisitions  the adoption of this guidance affected the reporting of our acquisition of badger equipment and manitex load king  inc in march  the fasb issued sfas no

in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic measuring liabilities at fair value  which provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  fair value is required to be measured using one or more valuation techniques 
these valuations may use techniques such as the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  a present value technique or a technique based on the amount at the measurement date that would have to be paid to transfer the identical liability or would be received to enter into the identical liability 
this update also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
this update also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required  are level fair value measurements

in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amended asc  revenue recognition 
this guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how to allocate the consideration to each unit of accounting 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered item s shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items have value on a stand alone basis if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered items on a stand alone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
arrangement consideration shall be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price  except under certain circumstances such as items recorded at fair value and items not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists for a deliverable  the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
this guidance eliminates the use of the residual value method for determining allocation of arrangement consideration and allows the use of an entity s best estimate to determine the selling price if vsoe and third party evidence cannot be determined 
it also requires additional disclosures such as the nature of the arrangement  certain provisions within the arrangement  significant factors used to determine selling prices and the timing of revenue recognition related to the arrangement 
this guidance shall be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted
