dpi secuprint s results for the period from december  to december  are included in amounts 
in october  the company sold its legalstore 
com division 
in accordance with asc  the company reported the results of legalstore 
com as continued operations because the operations and cash flows of the component have not been eliminated and given the company s continued involvement after the sale 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes that appear elsewhere in this report 
revenue year ended december  year ended december  change revenue security and commercial printing technology license royalties and digital solutions legal products total revenue revenue vs revenue in increased from security and commercial print sales increased which reflects the impact of the company s acquisition of dpi secuprint  a commercial printer  in december  this increase was offset by a decrease in royalty revenue of which primarily reflects the impact of a non recurring royalty of  recorded in the second quarter of furthermore  the company experienced a decline of revenue at its legalstore 
com division due to the sale of the division in october of  as well as a decline in revenue prior to the sale caused by the global recession 
in accordance with asc  the company reported the results of legalstore 
com as continued operations because the operations and cash flows of the component have not been eliminated and given the company s continued involvement after the sale 
during  all of the company s divisions were adversely affected by significant delays or reductions in orders by core customers that reflected the rapid decline in the us and global economies during the latter half of and the first half of the company began to see demand in each of divisions to return to more traditional levels in the third quarter of and expects this trend to continue as the us and global economies stabilize 
gross profit year ended december  year ended december  change costs of revenue security and commercial printing technology license royalties and digital solutions legal products total cost of revenue gross profit security and commercial printing technology license royalties and digital solutions legal products total gross profit year ended december  year ended december  change gross profit percentage gross profit vs gross profit in was flat as compared to while sales increased in  the mix of sales was significantly different from due to the increase of commercial printing by the company as a result of the company s acquisition of dpi secuprint in december commercial printing typically carries lower margins than the company s security printing projects 
in addition  the company increased the fixed cost component of its cost of sales as a result of investments in equipment at the company s plastic printing facility which while significantly increasing that division s production capacity and capabilities  caused margins in that division to decline as sales gains did not fully offset the increase in costs 
finally  gross margins were favorably impacted by a one time non recurring deferred revenue item in that carried a gross margin 
without this one time item  gross margins would have increased over operating expenses year ended december  year ended december  change operating expenses sales  general and administrative compensation professional fees sales and marketing research and development rent and utilities other other operating expenses depreciation and amortization stock based payments impairment of patent defense costs and other intangible assets amortization of intangibles total operating expenses selling  general and administrative vs sales  general and administrative compensation costs were higher in  compared to  due to sales and administrative staff additions as the result of the company s acquisition of its commercial printing business in december otherwise  sg a compensation costs at the company s remaining divisions would have decreased during compared to  as the result of significant staff reductions in sales  marketing and administration that the company initiated in the middle of and during the first quarter of professional fees decreased in from primarily as a result of a significant decrease in consulting fees which was offset by a significant increase in legal fees incurred by the company as a result of increase of usage of external legal counsel after the company s legal counsel left the company in march of  including an increase in legal costs associated with non ecb related litigation matters 
the company has evaluated its use of external legal counsel and expects legal costs to decline in sales and marketing expenses decreased significantly in as compared to as the company changed its primary sales and marketing strategy resulting in a reduction in its non direct marketing costs  its international sales cost  and an overall reduction in sales related travel 
the company focused its efforts in on direct sales techniques that utilize telephone and web conferencing communication with current and prospective customers  along with increasing its internet presence focused on the company s primary e commerce website www

com 
research and development costs consist primarily of compensation costs for research personnel and direct costs for the use of third party printers facilities to test our technologies on equipment that we do not have access to internally 
research and development costs decreased during compared to as the result of lower external research costs and reduction in compensation cost as the company reduced the department by two persons 
rent and utilities increased in as a result of the company s acquisition of its commercial printing business in december  which operates a  square foot facility in rochester  ny

other operating expenses are primarily equipment maintenance and repairs  office supplies  it support  bad debt expense and insurance costs 
on a consolidated basis  these costs decreased by in as compared to  despite the addition of other expenses associated with the company s acquisition of dpi secuprint in december  as the company reduced insurance costs and office and miscellaneous costs stock based compensation includes expense charges for all stock based awards to employees  directors and consultants 
such awards include option grants  warrant grants  and restricted stock awards 
stock based compensation as compared to  as current period stock based compensation expense was offset by reversals of previously recorded stock based compensation expense for stock options and restricted shares issued to the company s employees which terminated unvested due to employee terminations that occurred during furthermore  the company s compensation costs for option awards granted in are lower than past awards as the company has typically granted out the money options due to the company s lower than average stock price during the year 
impairment of patent defense costs and other intangible assets on march   the company received notification that its appeal of the invalidation of its european patent b in the uk was not successful 
as result of the adverse court decision  the company recognized an impairment loss of  associated with costs directly related to the u 
k appeal as of march  the impairment loss includes a judgment for reimbursement of estimated counterpart legal fees 
in january   the company received a formal request for fee reimbursement from the ecb for a total of  inclusive of amounts already paid by the company

under the terms of the agreement  and in consideration for trebuchet s funding obligations  the company assigned and transferred a interest of the company s rights  title and interest in the patent to trebuchet which allows trebuchet to have as a separate and exclusive interest including a separate and distinct right to exploit the patent 
pursuant to this transaction  the company recognized a loss on the sale of patent assets for its assignment and transfer of of its ownership rights in the patent  which had a net book value of approximately  for  as a result  the company recognized a loss on sale of patent assets of  gain on deconsolidation of legalstore 
com division in october  the company sold its legalstore 
com division for a non controlling interest ownership interest in internet media services 
the company recognized a gain on the transaction of approximately  as the estimated fair value of consideration received in exchange for the assets and liabilities sold exceeded the company s book value of the assets and liabilities 
the company accounted for the deconsolidation of the business by recognizing a gain in net income  measured as the difference between the fair value of the consideration received  which in the company s case is a equity interest in internet media services  inc over the book value of the assets and liabilities transferred 
the company determined that the consideration received was not readily measurable because there was no activity in internet media services  inc prior to the transaction 
therefore  the company determined the value of the business transferred was more readily measurable and determined the fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
litigation settlements on december   the company reached an agreement to issue  shares of common stock valued at approximately  and  of common stock warrants valued at approximately  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  for the purchase of common shares at per share in connection with the settlement of certain litigation between the company and the recipients

cash flows from operating activities investing activities financing activities working capital current ratio x x cash and cash equivalents funds available from open credit facilities debt excluding unamortized debt discount as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  representing an increase over our december  cash position 
as discussed below  the increase in the company s cash position was primarily due to funds received from the issuance of equity offset by use of cash from operations 
operating cash flow during  the company used approximately million of cash for operations  a decrease in its use of cash for operations compared to  which generally reflected the company s increase in sales and the significant decrease in operating costs that the company achieved during the year 
specifically  the company realized the benefits of significant cost reductions that it initiated in and early in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company received  from a new york state qualified emerging technology company tax refund that significantly improved the company s operating cash flow 
the company used a portion of its cash to improve its working capital position to negative  from negative  at december  investing cash flow during  the company used approximately  for investing activities 
specifically  the company used  for capital equipment at its commercial printing plant and plastic printing plants  respectively  along with approximately  for payments for patent application fees 
these expenditures were offset by the release of  from restricted cash 
the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december   other than operating leases for certain equipment for its newly acquired commercial printing operation 
financing cash flows during  the company significantly improved its financial position by refinancing  of its shorter term debt into longer term debt  raising million in equity through the private placement of its common shares  and converting  in debt to equity 
as of december   the company had debt of  all of which is due on various date in future capital needs the company expects to use its existing cash to support its operations and its efforts to achieve consistent positive cash flow from operations 
on february   the company obtained  in secured debt and a  revolving line of credit in conjunction with its acquisition of premier packaging corp 
this acquisition  while adding to the company s debt levels  is expected to improve the company s operating cash flow in and beyond by adding a business that has historically generated positive cash flows  as well as by creating opportunities by integrating that business with existing product lines 
during  the company raised approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of its common stock in private placements to accredited investors 
furthermore  as of december   the company has approximately  in cash   available to it under one credit facility and up to  available under a credit line at its premier packaging subsidiary acquired in in february  the company raised approximately million through the exercise of warrants and sale of shares of common stock through private placements 
the company used approximately  of these funds towards the acquisition of premier packaging corp 
the remainder is available for working capital requirements 
at its current revenue levels and with the impact of the company s acquisition of premier packaging in february  the company expects its use of cash for operations to reduce during from the levels  and is striving to reach and maintain positive operating cash flows on a consistent basis in  although there is no guarantee the company will be able to do so 
the company s ability to fund its capital requirements out of its available cash and cash generated from its operations depends on a number of factors 
some of these factors include the company s ability to i increase commercial and security printing and plastic card sales  ii increase sales of the company s digital products  and iii integrate its new acquisition of premier packaging with its existing product lines 
if the company cannot generate sufficient cash from its operations  the company may need to raise additional funds in the future in order to fund its working capital needs 
key indicators of future results we believe that cash flow from operations is a significant key indicator for the company 
our ability to reduce our use of cash will depend on our ability to grow revenue to a level sufficient to meet our operating expense requirements 
to grow revenue  we may merge with or acquire manufacturing or related companies 
our ability to successfully complete these transactions on favorable terms will be a significant key indicator of our future results 
these acquisitions may require additional funds that the company does not currently have 
to obtain additional investments in the future may require us to issue shares of our common stock 
our ability to sell our common stock on favorable terms will also be a significant key indicator of our future results 
in addition  we believe that our ability to successfully enforce our patent rights  including our current litigation against the european central bank  is a significant key indicator for the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  an effect on our financial condition  financial statements  revenues or expenses 
inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during or as we are generally able to pass the increase in our material and labor costs to our customers  or absorb them as we improve the efficiency of our operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  goodwill impairments  inventory allowances  revenue recognition  stock based compensation valuations  the valuation of intangible assets  and allocation of assets in business combinations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost 
depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of five to seven years using the straight line depreciation method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term 
intangible assets consist primarily of royalty rights  contractual rights  customer list  and patent acquisition  application and defense costs 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of five to twenty years using the straight line depreciation method 
for patent related assets  the remaining legal life of the patent is used as the estimate useful life unless circumstances determine that the useful life will be less than the legal life 
long lived assets to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets based on estimated future cash flows from and the estimated fair value of such long lived assets  and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized  rather it is tested for impairment annually  and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level  but are combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
the company has three reporting units based on the current structure 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the company completed its assessment of any potential impairment upon adoption of this standard and performs annual assessments 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if an indicator of impairment occurs 
to determine whether goodwill is impaired  we determine the fair values of each of our reportable business unit using a discounted cash flow methodology and then compare the fair values to the carrying values of each reportable business unit 
the current carrying value of goodwill of document security systems is  with estimated discounted cash flow of  which includes projected cash flows from operations and estimated cash flow from successful results in infringement suits 
the current carrying value of goodwill of plastic printing professionals is  with an estimated discounted cash flow of  based on projected cash flows from operations 
as of december   the annual testing date  the company s market capitalization was approximately million compared to stockholders equity of million 
we have determined that a decrease in the fair value of any one of our reporting units as of december  would have no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 
though we believe our estimates are reasonable  these fair values require the use of management s assumptions  which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 
other intangible assets and patent defense costs other intangible assets consists of costs associated with the application  acquisition and defense of the company s patents  contractual rights to patents and trade secrets associated with the company s technologies  a non exclusive licensing agreement  and customer lists obtained as a result of acquisitions 
the company s patents and trade secrets are for document anti counterfeiting and anti scanning technologies and processes that form the basis of the company s document security business 
patent application costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the patent  which generally approximates its legal life 
external legal costs incurred to defend the company s patents are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patents and an expected successful outcome  in accordance to guidance provided by fasb concept statement no 
and related guidance in aicpa technical questions and answers  section  other assets  paragraph  legal expenses incurred to defend patent infringement suit 
patent defense costs are expensed at the point when it is determined that the outcome is expected to be unsuccessful 
the company capitalizes the cost of an appeal until it is determined that the appeal will be unsuccessful 
the company s capitalized patent defense costs expenses are analyzed for impairment based on the expected eventual outcome of the legal action and recoverability of proceeds or added economic value of the patent in excess of the costs 
legal actions related to the same patent defense case are unified into one asset group for the purposes on the impairment analysis 
the company amortizes its other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
patents are amortized over the remaining legal life  up to years 
intangible asset amortization expense is generally classified as an operating expense 
the company believes that the decision to incur patent costs is discretionary as the associated products or services can be sold prior to or during the application process 
the company accounts for other intangible amortization as an operating expense  unless the underlying asset is directly associated with the production or delivery of a product 
to date  the amount of related amortization expense for other intangible assets directly attributable to revenue recognized is not material 
in december  the company recorded an impairment  for this license agreement the company had acquired in for rss barcodes for which the company assessed that the probable future cash flows derived from the license did not support the net carrying value of the license as of december  on march   the company received notification that its appeal of the invalidation of its european paten b in the uk was not successful 
as a result of the adverse court decision  the company recognized an impairment loss of  associated with the costs directly related to the uk appeal 
the impairment loss includes a judgment for reimbursement of estimated counterpart legal fees 
in january  the company received a formal request for the fee reimbursement from the ecb of  in addition to the amounts already paid by the company 
the company hired an independent firm to assist the company in reducing or eliminating the ecb s fees request  however  the company recorded  as additional accrued expenses and an impairment loss as of december  on july   the uk court made the final assessment of costs for the uk patent validity case due from the company to the ecb of  of which the company has paid  pounds through december  and owes approximately   as of december   which amount was included in accrued expenses as of december  on august   the company entered into an agreement with trebuchet capital partners  llc trebuchet under which trebuchet has agreed to pay substantially all of the litigation costs associated with pending validity proceedings initiated by the european central bank ecb in eight european countries relating to the company s european patent b that the company has claimed the ecb infringed in printing of the euro currency the patent 
trebuchet also agreed to pay substantially all of the litigation costs associated with future validity challenges filed by the ecb or other parties  provided that trebuchet elects to assume the defense of any such challenges  in its sole discretion  and patent infringement suits filed against the ecb and certain other alleged infringers of the patent  all of which suits may be brought at the sole discretion of trebuchet and may be in the name of the company  trebuchet or both 
the company provided trebuchet with the sole and exclusive right to manage infringement litigation relating to the patent in europe  including the right to initiate litigation in the name of the company  trebuchet or both and to choose whom and where to sue  subject to certain limitations set forth in the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  the company and trebuchet have agreed to equally share all proceeds generated from litigation relating to the patent  including judgments and licenses or other arrangements entered into in settlement of any such litigation 
trebuchet is also entitled to recoup any litigation expenses specifically awarded to the company in such actions 
under the terms of the agreement  and in consideration for trebuchet s funding obligations  the company assigned and transferred a interest of the company s rights  title and interest in the patent to trebuchet which allows trebuchet to have a separate and distinct interest in and share of the patent  along with the right to sue and recover in litigation  settlement or otherwise to collect royalties or other payments under or on account of the patent 
pursuant to this transaction  the company recognized a loss on the sale of patent assets for its assignment and transfer of of its ownership rights in the patent  which had a net book value of approximately  for proceeds of  as a result  the company recognized a loss on sale of patent assets of as of december   the company had a net carrying value of approximately  of other intangible assets and patent defense costs of which  was acquired intangibles   was patent acquisition and defense costs and  was patent application costs 
the estimated cash flow that support the carrying values of these assets are derived at the reporting unit level  except for patent defense costs which are only supported by the estimated cash flow from successful results in infringement suits  if any

share based payments we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for which awards are expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services the company determines the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendor s performance is complete 
in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants  the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the black scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table 
volatility expected option term years years risk free interest rate expected forfeiture rate expected dividend yield income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting

since the company has had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggest that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
as a result  as of the years ended december  and  the company has elected to record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to zero 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provisions benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
investment valuation and deconsolidation on october   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with internet media services  inc whereby the company sold the assets and liabilities of legalstore 
com  a division of the company  in exchange for  shares of common stock of the internet media services  inc the company recorded its investment in internet media services as an equity method investment at the fair market value of the business sold 
management determined that the transaction did not qualify as a non monetary exchange due to the exception noted in asc 
a transfer of assets to an entity in exchange for an equity interest in that entity 
management determined that the transaction qualified as a derecoginition of a subsidiary under asc therefore  the company accounted for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary the business by recording the consideration received at fair market value and recognizing a gain in net income measured as the difference between the fair value of the consideration received  shares of common stock of internet media services  inc or a interest and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities sold 
given that the consideration received is not readily measurable because of the lack of activity in internet media services  inc prior to the transaction  the company determined that the value of the business transferred is more readily measurable 
the company determined the fair market value of the business transferred based on a discounted cash flow model 
the company is recording the equity method investment at fair value 
under the equity method investment the company is required to account for the difference between the cost of an investment and the amount of the underlying equity in net assets of an investee as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary 
if the investor is unable to relate the difference to specific accounts of the investee eg  property and equipment  the difference should be considered to be the same as goodwill 
investors shall not amortize goodwill associated with equity method investments after the date asc statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  is initially applied by the entity in its entirety 
the company has determined that given the lack of activity in internet media services  inc prior to the transaction  the difference between the cost of the investment fair market value and the underlying equity interest is attributable to goodwill 
the company is continuing to report the activity in operating loss and not breaking out and reporting it as discontinued operations because the operations and cash flows of the component have not been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the equity method investment and because the company will have significant continuing involvement in the operations of internet media services  inc after the disposal transaction because of the ownership percentage and the board representation
