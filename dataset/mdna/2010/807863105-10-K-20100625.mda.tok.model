all forward looking statements included in this annual report are based on information available to us as of the date hereof 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statements that may be made by or on behalf of us  in this annual report or otherwise 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the risk factors set forth below 
our business depends upon the growth of the student population and school expenditures and can be adversely impacted by fixed school budgets 
our growth strategy and profitability depend in part on growth in the student population and expenditures per student in prek schools 
the level of student enrollment is largely a function of demographics  while expenditures per student are affected by federal  state and local government budgets 
for example  from to  the industry was negatively affected by a generally weakened economic environment which placed pressure on some state and local budgets  the primary sources of school funding 
this was evidenced  among other things  by the decline in state tax revenue in in addition  the current macroeconomic weakness has resulted in significantly reduced school budgets 
in school districts in states that primarily rely on local tax proceeds for funding  significant reductions in those proceeds for any reason can restrict district expenditures and impact our results of operations 
any significant and sustained decline in student enrollment and or expenditures per student could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
because school budgets are fixed on a yearly basis  any shift by schools in expenditures during a given fiscal year to areas that are not part of our business  such as facility operating costs and employee related expenditures  could also materially affect our business 
the negative global macroeconomic conditions could impact the education funding provided by state and local governments 
the weakened economic environment has placed increased pressure on state and local government budgets  which are the primary source of school funding 
the global economy is currently suffering from the effects of the latest recession which has lead to a decline in consumer and business spending and confidence 
this has resulted in our customers delaying or cutting school expenditures as the recession creates state and local budget deficits and uncertainty 
the federal stimulus funds that were provided by the federal government to school districts helped education funding in  but these federal funds have been fully distributed and states have not been able to replace them due to declining state revenue 
if the global economic downturn worsens or continues for a significant period of time  it could result in a significant and sustained decline in the per student funding levels provided for in state and local budgets which could have a materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a continued decline in school spending will impact our ability to maintain operating margins 
we have been able to maintain operating margins in fiscal despite school spending cuts  which were a key contributor to our revenue decline 
the company will continue to aggressively pursue further cost reductions if school spending continues to decline  but the company will not cut costs in areas that it believes could have a significant impact on future revenue growth 
to the extent we are unable to identify additional cost reductions that can be made consistent with our strategy and the weakness in school spending persists  our operating margin may decline 
increased costs and other difficulties associated with the distribution of our products would adversely affect our results of operations 
higher than expected costs and other difficulties associated with the distribution of our products could affect our results of operations 
to the extent we incur difficulties or higher than expected costs related to updating our distribution centers  such costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any disruption in our ability to service our customers may also impact our revenues or profits 
moreover  as we update our distribution model or change the product mix of our distribution centers  we may encounter unforeseen costs or difficulties that may have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
our business is highly seasonal 
because most of our customers want their school supplies delivered before or shortly after the commencement of the school year  we record most of our revenues from june to october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of orders for our products so that schools and teachers receive their products by the start of each school year 
to the extent we do not sell our products to schools during the peak shipping season  many of such sales opportunities will be lost and will not be available in subsequent quarters 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
this seasonality causes our operating results and operating cash flows to vary considerably from quarter to quarter within our fiscal years 
if our key suppliers or service providers were unable to provide the products and services we require  our business could be adversely affected 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some of our products  especially furniture and proprietary products 
we also depend upon a limited number of service providers for the delivery of our products 
if these suppliers or service providers are unable to provide the products or services that we require or materially increase their costs especially during our peak season of june through october  our ability to deliver our products on a timely and profitable basis could be impaired and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our agreements with our suppliers are terminable at any time or on short notice  with or without cause  and  while we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be good  we cannot assure that any or all of our relationships will not be terminated or that such relationships will continue as presently in effect 
our business is highly competitive 
the market for supplemental educational products and equipment is highly competitive and fragmented 
we estimate that over  companies market supplemental educational products and equipment to schools with prek as a primary focus of their business 
we also face competition from alternate channel marketers  including office supply superstores  office product contract stationers  and purchasing cooperatives that have not traditionally focused on marketing supplemental educational products and equipment 
our competitors impact the prices we are able to charge and we expect to continue to face pricing pressure from our competitors in the future 
these competitors are likely to continue to expand their product lines and interest in supplemental educational products and equipment 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources and buying power than we do 
we believe that the supplemental educational products and equipment market will consolidate over the next several years  which could increase competition in both our markets and our search for attractive acquisition candidates 
we also face increased competition and pricing pressure as a result of the accessibility of the internet 
if any of our key personnel discontinue their role with us  our business could be adversely affected 
our business depends to a large extent on the abilities and continued efforts of current executive officers and senior management 
we are also likely to depend heavily on the executive officers and senior management of businesses that we acquire in the future 
if any of these people becomes unable or unwilling to continue in his or her role  or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel and qualified employees  our business could be adversely affected 
we have employment contracts with many of our key officers 
other than the life insurance we have in place for our chief executive officer  we do not have and do not intend to obtain key man life insurance covering any of our executive officers or other members of our management 
a failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our operations and growth opportunities 
our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and we may not be successful in implementing our strategy 
in addition  the implementation of our strategy may not lead to improved operating results 
we may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt alternative or additional strategies due to business or competitive factors or factors not currently expected  such as unforeseen costs and expenses or events beyond our control 
any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and growth opportunities 
we face risks associated with our increasing emphasis on imported goods and private label products 
increases in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported goods may adversely impact our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows 
our business strategy includes an increased emphasis on offering private label products and sourcing quality merchandise directly from low cost suppliers 
as a result  we expect to rely more heavily on imported goods from china and other countries and we expect the sale of imported goods to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues 
to the extent we rely more heavily on the sale of private label products  our potential exposure to product liability claims may increase 
in addition  our reputation may become more closely tied to our private label products and may suffer to the extent our customers are not satisfied with the quality of such products 
private label products will also increase our risks associated with returns and inventory obsolescence 
our reliance on imported merchandise subjects us to a number of risks  including a increased difficulties in ensuring quality control  b disruptions in the flow of imported goods due to factors such as raw material shortages  work stoppages  strikes  and political unrest in foreign countries  c problems with oceanic shipping  including shipping container shortages  d economic crises and international disputes  e increases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from a failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and the other countries we do business in  f import duties  import quotas  and other trade sanctions  and g increases in shipping rates imposed by the trans pacific shipping cartel 
if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable  we may not be able to transition to alternative sources in time to meet our demands 
a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods due to these or other factors would significantly decrease our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows 
currency exchange rates may impact our financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
to the extent we source merchandise from overseas manufacturers and sell products internationally  exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to service our us dollar denominated debt 
the majority of our debt will be in us dollars while a portion of our revenue is derived from imported products and international sales 
therefore  fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies versus the us dollar could impact our costs and revenues 
in addition  for the purposes of financial reporting  any change in the value of the foreign currencies against the us dollar during a given financial reporting period would result in a foreign currency loss or gain 
consequently  our reported earnings could fluctuate as a result of foreign exchange translation and may not be comparable from period to period 
it is difficult to forecast our revenue stream given the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers and delays in passage of state budgets 
the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers  the fact that our customers typically purchase products on an as needed basis  and the lack of visibility to education funding levels if state budgets are delayed make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenue stream  which may vary significantly from period to period 
financial analysts and others that may seek to project our future performance face similar difficulties 
the difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue increases the likelihood that our financial results will differ materially from any projected financial results 
any shortfall in our financial results from our  or third party  projected results could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and our convertible subordinated notes 
if we are unable to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
a significant amount of our past growth has come from acquisitions 
future growth in our revenues and earnings will be impacted by our ability to continue to acquire and successfully integrate businesses 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify and acquire businesses on reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to do so  our future growth may be limited  or our revenues could decline 
in addition  the integration of acquired businesses with our existing business operations presents many challenges and can demand significant attention from our key managers 
the demands placed upon the time of our management team may adversely affect the operation of our existing business 
managing and integrating acquired businesses may result in substantial costs  delays  or other operating or financial problems that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
key risks in making acquisitions involve failure to execute as well or as quickly as anticipated on our integration plans  including the integration of acquired employees  operations  technologies and products with our existing business and products  ineffective due diligence process on acquired business  retention of business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business  loss of key personnel of the acquired business  the diversion of our management during the integration process  and resistance to cultural changes in the acquired organization 
we have a material amount of goodwill  other intangible assets and capitalized product development costs which might be written down 
at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition exceed the fair value of the net assets we acquire 
we are required to evaluate whether our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired on an annual basis  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
reductions in our net income caused by the write down of our existing goodwill or intangible assets or any goodwill or intangible assets acquired in any future acquisition we may make could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  we had capitalized product development costs of million and million at april  and april   respectively  related to both internally developed and acquired proprietary products  which are amortized to expense over the lesser of five years or the product s life cycle 
any changes in the estimated sales volume or life cycle of the underlying products could cause the currently capitalized costs or costs capitalized in the future to be impaired 
volatility in our stock price as a result of the negative macroeconomic conditions could result in a potential goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charge 
goodwill impairment analysis and measurement require significant management judgment 
the company s stock price and an estimated control premium are two factors that can significantly impact the fair value assessment of the company s reporting units 
the significant decline in the general global economic conditions has led to volatility in the company s stock price during fiscal and fiscal during this period  our stock price fluctuated between a high of per share and a low of per share 
if the current worldwide economic downturn continues  it could result in circumstances  such as a sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a decrease in our forecasted cash flows  that potentially indicate that the carrying value of our long lived assets or goodwill may be impaired 
if we are required to record a significant non cash charge to our earnings because of an impairment of our long lived assets or goodwill  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
our operations are dependent on our information systems 
we have integrated the operations of most of our divisions and subsidiaries  which operate on systems located at both our greenville  wisconsin  headquarters and our third party hosted erp system provider s facilities 
in addition  there are divisions running legacy systems hosted at their locations 
all systems rely on continuous telecommunication connections to the main computers 
if any of these connections becomes disrupted  or unavailable  for an extended period of time  the disruption could materially and adversely affect our business  operations and financial performance 
we also continue to introduce new information systems to achieve a common processing infrastructure for all of our businesses  particularly the new erp platform described elsewhere in this report  which will displace existing legacy systems 
as we implement the new systems  there is the potential for disruptions if the new systems do not perform as expected 
even though we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from unexpected events that could interrupt new  existing and acquired business operations and systems  we cannot be sure that fire  flood or other natural disasters would not disable our systems and or prevent them from communicating between business segments 
the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also face challenges in integrating the information systems of any companies we acquire 
the costs associated with performing such integrations or any disruptions resulting from a failure to successfully make any such integration could materially impact our business 
we rely on our intellectual property in the design and marketing of our products 
we rely on certain trademarks  trade names and service names  along with licenses to use and exploit certain trademarks  trade names and service names collectively  the marks in the design and marketing of some of our products 
we could lose our ability to use our brands if our marks were found to be generic or non descriptive 
while no single mark is material to our business  the termination of a number of these marks could have an adverse effect on our business 
we also rely on certain copyrights  patents and licenses other than those described above  the termination of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business  could prohibit us from engaging in transactions we believe to be beneficial and could lead to the acceleration of our debt 
our existing and future debt agreements impose and may impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities 
these restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios  and restrict our ability and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt  create liens  make acquisitions  redeem and or prepay certain debt  sell or dispose of a minority equity interest in any subsidiary or other assets  make capital expenditures  make certain investments  enter new lines of business  engage in consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  repurchase or redeem capital stock  guarantee obligations  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and pay dividends and make other distributions 
our amended and restated senior credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial ratios  including a total leverage ratio  a senior leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  mergers and acquisitions  and other corporate opportunities 
in the event that we fail to comply with the financial ratios contained in our amended and restated credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we may not have sufficient assets to repay our amended and restated credit facility 
also  should there be an event of default  or need to obtain waivers following an event of default  we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and or more restrictive covenants in future periods

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
background we are a leading education company serving the prek education market by providing products  programs and services that enhance student achievement and development to educators and schools across the united states and canada 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
our goal is to grow profitably as a leading provider of supplemental education products 
we expect to achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and through selective acquisitions 
although we experienced a revenue decline in fiscal due primarily to the significant impact the current macroeconomic conditions have had on school spending  historically  we have grown through a combination of acquisitions and internal investments that drive organic growth 
in the past few years  our growth strategies have been focused primarily on the curriculum based supplemental products  and we expect that this focus will continue in the foreseeable future 
while the number of acquisitions that we have completed has declined in the past two years  acquisitions remain a key strategy for us 
our future acquisition plans are focused primarily on acquiring curriculum based products in disciplines where the company s current product offerings do not have the desired breadth and depth 
in addition  the company is committed to continuing to invest in its internal product development efforts in order to expand current offerings such as its science and reading intervention curricula 
these growth plans  both through acquisitions and internal product development  will be mainly focused on curriculum based products because these types of products provide a competitive advantage in their proprietary nature  and have typically provided greater profit margins to the company 
the company s annual revenue growth from curriculum based products has been and will continue to be impacted by the cyclical nature of state adoptions of these products 
our state adoption revenue will continue to have significant variability between years due to the adoption schedules established by the individual states 
the company also remains committed to its commodity type products and  while its acquisition strategy is more focused on curriculum based supplemental products  the company continues to invest resources towards increasing the company s market share for these commodity based products 
our gross margin has improved from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was due primarily to product mix through the acquisition of higher margin curriculum products 
the accelerated learning group formerly named publishing segment has traditionally experienced higher revenue growth than the educational resources segment  resulting in a product mix with higher gross margins 
in addition  our growth has increased our purchasing power  resulting in reduced costs of the products we purchase 
another factor contributing to the increased gross margin is the direct sourcing of product through overseas channels 
also  the year to year variation in state adoption revenue  which is typically higher gross margin product  will have an impact on gross margin between years 
our operating income from continuing operations was million  million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  our operating income and margin from continuing operations were million and  respectively 
the company s business results have been negatively impacted by the recent downturn in the economy 
the current economic conditions resulted in revenue and profitability declines as cautious spending by schools and teachers and growing state budget deficits have created uncertainty as to upcoming education funding levels from the states 
in response to this uncertainty as to education funding  a possible period of reduced spending by schools and the uncertainty of the duration of any such reduction  all of which could negatively impact our revenues  the company initiated a significant expense reduction plan in order to better balance expenses and product costs with potentially lower revenue 
the expense reduction plan was accomplished through a combination of facility closures  functional department consolidations that resulted in staff reductions  and improvements in our control of product costs through negotiations with some of the company s larger vendors 
these cost savings partially offset the decline attributable to the revenue shortfall caused by the weakened economy 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal  with peak sales levels occurring from june through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our business so that schools and teachers receive their products by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our business is highly seasonal  and the acquisition of seasonal businesses during the off season has depressed operating and net income in the year of acquisition  the most dramatic of which in recent years was the delta education acquisition in fiscal the company is expecting that the upcoming back to school season will be another difficult period as school funding remains under pressure 
as such  the company expects another year of revenue decline but is hopeful for school spending to begin to rebound during the second half of fiscal as revenue declines through continued school spending cuts  the company s ability to maintain operating margins will be increasingly challenged as our ability to make additional cost reductions may not keep pace 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed the acquisition of autoskill international  inc autoskill for an aggregate purchase price of million 
autoskill is a leading education technology company that provides educators with reading and math intervention solutions for struggling students 
this business has been integrated into the company s educator s publishing service business within the accelerated learning group segment 
the results of autoskill have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements under item since the date of acquisition and would not have had a material effect on the company s overall performance on a pro forma basis and did not have a material effect on the company s fiscal performance 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed the divestiture of the school specialty publishing business unit to carson dellosa publishing  llc  a newly formed business entity 
under the divestiture agreement  the company combined its publishing unit net assets with those of cookie jar education  inc and received a interest  accounted for under the equity method  in carson dellosa publishing  a newly formed entity 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed the acquisition of sitton spelling sitton from egger publishing  inc for an all cash  aggregate purchase price of million 
sitton offers spelling and word skills programs to help educators in the area of reading intervention 
sitton also has professional development programs for educators through nationwide seminars conducted by independent trainers 
this business has been integrated into the company s educator s publishing service business within the accelerated learning group segment 
the results of sitton have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements under item since the date of acquisition and would not have had a material effect on the company s overall performance on a pro forma basis and did not have a material effect on the company s fiscal performance 
the company announced in fiscal its intention to sell the hawthorne  new york based school specialty media ssm business unit 
the sale  which was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  reflects the company s desire to focus investments and management s attention on those businesses that advance the company s long term growth strategies 
those long term growth strategies include strengthening the company s presence in those categories that require higher educational content products and services  such as science curriculum and reading intervention solutions 
at the same time  the company remains committed to its commodity type products and markets and will continue to invest in those products and markets 
however  management believes that the future growth of the company is more dependent on those products with higher educational content 
in pursuit of our long term growth strategy the company is in the process of investing company resources  both financial capital and human capital  in product development programs focused on those educational content areas as well as acquisition targets that already have or are in the process of developing educational content products

consolidated historical results of continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion and analysis of fiscal results compared to fiscal results is based on a comparison of the company s results of operations from continuing operations 
overview of fiscal revenues for fiscal decreased to million as compared to billion in fiscal in the second half of fiscal  the company experienced a significant decline in revenue as the macroeconomic conditions which have created uncertainty in the school districts related to state budget funding levels 
this decline continued in fiscal as school budgets have come under more pressure  which in turn  has led to cautious spending by our customers 
within the educational resources segment  this cautious approach has been especially true in the furniture product lines  which has accounted for well over one half of the segment s revenue decline 
the decrease was also related to a decrease in state adoption revenue derived from the company s science curriculum based offering 
we anticipate that state adoption revenue will continue to have significant variability between years due to the adoption schedules established by individual states 
as a result of these schedules  we expect fiscal state adoption revenue to be comparable to fiscal amounts 
the company s overall revenue mix shifted toward the educational resources segment  with the segment comprising of revenues in fiscal as compared with in fiscal gross margins in the segment increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was attributable to net price increases in excess of product cost increases as the segment executed on its initiatives to better align its pricing structure with product costs as well as a product mix shift towards administrator and educator supplies products within the educational resources segment  which carry higher gross margins than furniture products 
operating income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in operating income is a result of macroeconomic conditions in fiscal and reductions in fiscal school spending due to the uncertainty in education funding levels and state budgetary concerns 
the operating margin increase is a result of both gross margin improvements and expense reductions resulting from compensation related decisions  headcount reductions  operational consolidations and restructuring and other cost control initiatives 
revenue revenues decreased from billion in fiscal to million in fiscal  which was attributable to declines in both the educational resources and accelerated learning group segments 
educational resources segment revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue amounts for both periods were comprised solely of sales to external parties 
the decline in educational resources segment revenue was comprised of a decline of approximately million  or approximately  in the administrator and educator supplies product lines and a decline of approximately million  or approximately  in the furniture product lines 
these declines were most directly attributable to the ongoing weakened economic conditions which we believe have negatively impacted school purchasing decisions 
this has been particularly noticeable in those states which have been more seriously affected by the economic decline  such as california  florida  illinois  and michigan 
the company believes that its cost cutting initiatives partially contributed to the revenue decline through elimination of catalogs and the back office consolidations that affected marketing and selling efforts 
the larger decline in furniture product line is reflective of the fact that those purchases are more discretionary in nature and the current economic conditions led to reductions in school construction and renovation activities 
the company expects the reduction in construction and renovation activities to continue in fiscal accelerated learning group segment revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues 
approximately million of the decline in accelerated learning group segment revenue was due to the decrease in state adoption revenue of the company s curriculum based products  primarily in the state of california  which the company had anticipated would occur 
in addition  the company s divestiture of its retail trade book business  school specialty publishing  resulted in a revenue decline of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal partially offsetting this decline was incremental revenue of million related to the company s acquisition of autoskill 
the remaining decline of approximately million  or approximately  was attributable to the impact that the downturn in the general economic conditions has had on school districts spending decisions 
the company is seeing school districts delaying some purchasing decisions on large curriculum orders in light of these economic conditions 
gross profit gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in consolidated revenue resulted in million of the decline in gross profit had consolidated gross margin remained constant offset by million of gross margin increases 
gross margin increased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin was related to gross margin increases in both segments  as further discussed below 
partially offsetting the gross margin increase was approximately basis points of gross margin decline related to the mix of revenue between segments 
the accelerated learning group segment  which generates higher margin than the educational resources segment  accounted for of the consolidated revenue in fiscal as compared to of the consolidated revenue in fiscal educational resources segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in segment revenue resulted in approximately million of the decline in gross profit had segment gross margin remained constant 
partially offsetting the decline was approximately million of incremental gross profit related to an increase of basis points in segment gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal approximately basis points of the gross margin improvement was related to the company s pricing initiatives which resulted in price increases in excess of product cost increases 
this includes the impact of lower transportation costs which were related to the decreased fuel costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company does not expect significant continued gross margin improvement related to pricing in the upcoming fiscal year 
the remaining gross margin improvement of approximately basis points was a result of product mix 
during fiscal  the revenue shifted to more consumable products versus furniture  and the consumable products generate a higher gross margin than the furniture products 
accelerated learning group segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in segment revenue resulted in million of the decline in the gross profit  had segment gross margin remained constant 
the decline was offset by an increase in gross margin of basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal  which increased gross profit by million 
the increase in gross margin is a result of favorable product mix shift within the segment 
the favorable mix is primarily related to the incremental revenue from the autoskill acquisition  a higher margin business due to the software content of its products  which increased gross margin by approximately basis points 
the remaining increase was related primarily to the divestiture of the school specialty publishing business in fiscal  which generated lower gross margin than the segment s overall gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include selling expenses  the most significant of which are sales wages and commissions  operations expenses  which include customer service  warehouse and out bound freight costs  catalog costs  general administrative overhead  which includes information systems  accounting  legal and human resources  and depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense 
sg a as a percent of revenues increased basis points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal sg a decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of the sg a reduction is attributable to compensation related decisions during the year including  suspension of a company k match  reduction in incentives  and a furlough for all employees 
in addition  overall full time employment declined by approximately associates  or  in fiscal  which translates into approximately million in compensation related cost reductions 
sg a attributable to the educational resources and accelerated learning group segments decreased a combined million and corporate sg a decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percent of sales  educational resources segment sg a increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percent of revenue was attributable to the fixed cost portion of sg a being spread over a smaller revenue base 
educational resources segment sg a decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the segment experienced a decrease of approximately million in its variable sg a costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses associated with decreased revenues 
the segment s portion of the savings from the above mentioned compensation related decisions was approximately million 
decreases in catalog circulation and the elimination of redundant catalog offerings contributed to a million decline in catalog costs 
improvements in the current year fill rate for warehouse shipments has translated into approximately million of operational efficiency in both warehouse and transportation 
the improved fill rate reduced the number of backorders 
the remaining decline was related primarily to the compensation savings associated with headcount reductions resulting from operational consolidations 
as a percent of sales  accelerated learning group segment sg a increased from in fiscal to in fiscal accelerated learning group segment sg a decreased million  or from in fiscal to million in fiscal the segment experienced a decrease of approximately million in its variable sg a costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses associated with decreased revenues 
the segment s portion of savings from the above mentioned compensation related decisions was approximately million 
the divestiture of the school specialty publishing business led to a million decrease in sg a  which was largely offset by the acquisition of autoskill  which increased sg a by million 
the remaining reduction is related primarily to compensation savings associated with headcount reductions 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue is due to the base non variable costs in comparison to decreased revenue 
corporate sg a decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of the million decrease in corporate sg a  approximately million is related to the above mentioned compensation related decisions  approximately million was related to fiscal expense incurred for the closing of the lyons  new york distribution center and approximately million was due to stock based compensation expense 
corporate also had a million dollar decrease in marketing expense as some corporate marketing associates were moved into the segments 
the remaining corporate sg a decrease was related primarily to the lower compensation and benefit costs  associated with headcount reductions 
these headcount reductions were a function of a combination of back office consolidation as well as staffing reductions made to address the revenue decline 
net interest expense on april   the company adopted fasb asc topic  debt with conversion and other options 
net interest expense including the impact of the adoption of fasb asc topic was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the non cash interest related to the adoption of fasb asc topic was million in fiscal compared to in fiscal net interest expense excluding the adoption of fasb asc topic decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of the decrease in interest expense was due to a reduction in the overall effective borrowing rate from in fiscal to in fiscal an million dollar decrease in the company s average outstanding borrowings in fiscal as compared to fiscal contributed approximately million of interest expense decrease 
partially offsetting the decreases was million of additional debt issuance amortization mainly related to the early retirement of the company s prior amended and restated credit agreement  which was replaced with a new credit agreement 
other expense other expense  which primarily consists of the discount and loss on the company s accounts receivable securitization  was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease was due to the non renewal of the company s securitization facility  which expired on january  provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of in both years primarily due to the impact of state and foreign taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion and analysis of fiscal results compared to fiscal results is based on a comparison of the company s results of operations from continuing operations 
overview of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its operating segments in order to align its segments with changes in the management and reporting structure of the company 
revenues from continuing operations for fiscal decreased to billion as compared to billion in fiscal this decrease was related primarily to a decrease in state adoption revenue derived from the company s science curriculum based offering 
also contributing to the decreased revenue was the economic slowdown and a delay in spending by school districts due to uncertainty as to the education funding levels because of state budgetary concerns 
the company s overall revenue mix shifted toward the educational resources segment  with the segment comprising of revenues in fiscal as compared with in fiscal gross margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was attributable to a combination of both the revenue mix shift towards educational resources  which typically has lower gross margins than accelerated learning group segment  and decreased gross margins in both segments 
the primary cause of the decreased gross margin in the educational resources segment was related to product mix shifting towards lower margin furniture products versus consumable products 
the remaining decline in gross margin was due to a combination of cost increases being passed on to the company from its vendors  and higher fuel costs increasing inbound freight costs associated with procuring the products 
operating income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in operating income and margins were primarily related to the declines in both consolidated revenue and gross margin 
reductions in selling  general and administrative costs partially offset the decline in operating income 
revenue revenues decreased from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal  which was attributable to declines in both the educational resources and accelerated learning group segments 
educational resources segment revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue amounts for both periods were comprised solely of sales to external parties 
the decrease in educational resources segment revenues was due primarily to a decline of approximately million in consumable products 
this was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in furniture and school building project revenue in fiscal the increase in furniture and school building project revenue was attributable mainly to school construction projects for which the schools and districts had committed funds prior to the economic downturn 
the decline in consumable products revenue was most directly attributable to the deteriorating economic conditions  which we believe have negatively impacted state budgets 
revenue from basic school supplies has been relatively stable in fiscal  but a shortfall in supplemental curriculum and student development supplies  which we believe are more discretionary and are purchased more at the educator level versus district level  accounted for a majority of the decline in consumable revenue within the segment 
accelerated learning group segment revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues 
the decrease in accelerated learning group segment revenues was primarily attributable to a decline of approximately million of state adoption revenue from the company s curriculum based products 
accelerated learning group segment revenue increased by million in fiscal due to realizing a full twelve months of revenue from the sitton acquisition  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal offsetting this million increase was a decline related to the downturn in the general economic conditions 
gross profit gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in consolidated revenue resulted in million of the decline in gross profit had consolidated gross margin remained constant 
the remaining decline of million was related to gross margin declines 
gross margin decreased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal approximately basis points of the decline in gross margin was related to the mix of revenue between segments 
the accelerated learning group segment  which generates higher margin than the educational resources segment  accounted for of the consolidated revenue in fiscal as compared to of the consolidated revenue in fiscal the remaining decline in gross margin was related to gross margin declines in both segments  as further discussed below 
educational resources segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in segment revenue resulted in million of the decline in gross profit had segment gross margin remained constant 
the remaining decline of million was related to a decline of basis points in segment gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal approximately million of the decline  or basis points  of the gross margin decline was a result of product mix shifting toward lower margin furniture products versus consumable products 
the remaining decline of approximately million  or basis points of gross margin  was related to increases both in product costs and inbound freight costs  primarily  during the higher volume summer months 
the company was not able to pass on vendor and transportation cost increases to customers due to current fixed pricing within contract agreements and longer lived catalogs 
accelerated learning group segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in segment revenue resulted in million of the decline in the gross profit  had segment gross margin remained constant 
the remaining decline of million was related to a decline of basis points segment gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal a shift in the product mix within the segment  primarily related to the decline in the higher margin curriculum based products for state adoptions  resulted in approximately basis points of gross margin decline 
partially offsetting this year over year decline related to product mix was the impact on fiscal gross margin of a million inventory donation from this segment which decreased fiscal gross margin by basis points 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percent of revenues increased basis points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal sg a decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in sg a costs was due primarily to reductions in variable costs associated with the revenue decline  reductions in variable performance based compensation expense  and other cost reduction efforts 
the increase in sg a as a percent of revenue was driven by the base of non variable costs in comparison to decreased revenue 
educational resources segment sg a remained flat as a percent of revenues at in both fiscal and fiscal educational resources segment sg a decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the segment incurred million of severance costs in fiscal related to headcount reductions and approximately million of additional costs for marketing initiatives 
these increases were offset by approximately million of a decline due to a decline in variable costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses associated with decreased revenues  and approximately million related to a reduction in variable performance based compensation expense 
the remaining decline was related primarily to the compensation savings associated with the headcount reductions 
accelerated learning group segment sg a remained flat as a percent of revenue at in both fiscal and fiscal accelerated learning group segment sg a decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the segment incurred million of severance costs associated with headcount reductions 
these increases were offset by approximately million of a decline in variable costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses mainly associated with decreased revenues and a reduction of approximately million in variable performance based compensation expense 
the remaining decrease was primarily related to the savings associated with headcount reductions 
corporate sg a increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in corporate sg a was primarily related to million for the closing of the lyons  new york distribution center  and million of severance costs related to the company s cost reduction efforts

the remaining decrease was related primarily to a reduction in average outstanding borrowings in fiscal  as cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by share repurchases made by the company during fiscal  were used to reduce debt 
other expense other expense  which primarily consisted of the discount and loss on the company s since discontinued accounts receivable securitization  was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal approximately million of the decrease in the discount and loss was due to lower effective discount rates associated with the company s securitization facility in fiscal as compared to fiscal the securitization facility expired on january  and the company elected to not renew the agreement due to the expected future expense of the facility compared to other sources of liquidity available to the company 
this reduced the amount of discount and loss in other expense in fiscal by approximately million 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase between years is primarily related to the incremental tax benefit realized in fiscal for favorable tax treatment of certain inventory donations

there were no outstanding amounts as of april  under either the revolving or incremental term loans 
our borrowings are usually significantly higher during the first two quarters of our fiscal year to meet the working capital requirements of our peak selling season 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and contains certain financial covenants  including a consolidated total and senior leverage ratio  a consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio and a limitation on consolidated capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at april  our million  convertible subordinated notes became convertible during the second quarter of fiscal as the closing price of the company s common stock exceeded for the specified amount of time 
as a result  holders of the notes may surrender the notes for conversion at any time from october  until july  the notes are recorded as a current liability

net cash provided by operating activities increased million from million in fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in the amount sold under the securitization facility which was not renewed as of january  excluding the impact of securitization facility  net cash provided by operating activities declined by million 
the remaining decline was related to a decrease in working capital improvements 
working capital decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in working capital is primarily related to the company s ability to collect accounts receivable in fiscal and decrease its dso as well as the decrease in the amount of inventory on hand as the company better manages its inventory balance 
the company s accounts receivable balances declined by million  million of which was due to the divestiture of the school specialty publishing business unit  with the remaining decline primarily related to a combination of improved collections and declining revenue 
inventories declined million  million of which was due to the divestiture of the school specialty publishing business unit  with the remaining decline due to improvements in procurement strategies  which were partially offset by a reduction of million in accounts payables 
accrued compensation balances decreased by million  million of which was due to the divestiture of the school specialty publishing business unit  with the remaining decline related to a combined change in the timing of commission payouts plus decreased commissions

the increased use of cash for share repurchases was offset by additional short term borrowings 
on june   we announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program  which allows us to purchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
as of april   million of this repurchase authorization is remaining 
purchases under the share repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
common stock acquired through the share repurchase program will be available for general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations  borrowings available from our existing credit facility and other sources of capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations  including anticipated capital expenditures  share repurchases and our contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
we expect our fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately million and to consist primarily of software costs related to the continued implementation of the new erp platform and warehouse management costs 
we expect our investment in product development to be approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements we had an accounts receivable securitization facility 
the facility expired january  and the company elected to not renew the facility due to the significant cost increases in accounts receivable asset backed securities markets compared to the costs of other sources of liquidity available to the company 
the company had originally entered into the facility for the purpose of reducing the company s variable rate interest expense 
however  in the current rate environment  the facility was not providing any material reduction in the company s variable rate interest expense and a renewed facility would have actually resulted in an increase to the company s variable rate interest expense 
the facility permitted advances up to million from july through november of each year  and advances up to million from december through june of each year 
costs associated with the sale of receivables  primarily related to the discount and loss on sale  for the fiscal years and were and million  respectively 
the decrease in these costs was related to a combination of decreased discount rates and the termination of the securitization facility 
these costs are included as a component of other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual debt and operating lease obligations as of april  payments due in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations convertible subordinated notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations long term debt obligations include principal and interest payments on our credit facility and sale leaseback obligations  assuming these obligations remain outstanding until maturity at current or contractually defined interest rates

the notes can be redeemed at the option of the company no earlier than november  the amounts reflected for these notes include accrued interest at the balance sheet date and interest at through november  as of april   we did not have any material long term purchase obligations 
the short term purchase obligations the company had as of april  were primarily for the purchase of inventory in the normal course of business 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal years and in thousands  except per share data 
we derived this quarterly data from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
fiscal first second third fourth total revenues gross profit operating income loss earnings loss from continuing operations  net of income taxes equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliate  net of tax net income loss basic earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations total diluted earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations total fiscal first second third fourth total revenues gross profit operating income loss earnings loss from continuing operations  net of income taxes net income loss basic earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations total diluted earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations total at the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  debt with conversion and other options fasb asc topic 
the adoption of fasb asc topic required an adjustment of previously reported amounts assigned to debt  deferred taxes  equity and interest expense 
inflation inflation  particularly in fuel and other oil related costs  has had and could continue to have an effect on our results of operations and our internal and external sources of liquidity 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business are discussed throughout md a where applicable 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition revenue  net of estimated returns and allowances  is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers  the selling price is fixed  the customer is obligated to pay  collectability is reasonably assured and we have no significant remaining obligations 
cash received in advance from customers is deferred on our balance sheet as a current liability and recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to the customers 
catalog costs and related amortization we spend over million annually to produce and distribute catalogs 
we accumulate all direct costs incurred  net of vendor cooperative advertising payments  in the development  production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed 
they are subsequently amortized into sg a over the expected sales realization cycle  which is one year or less 
consequently  any difference between our estimated and actual revenue stream for a particular catalog and the related impact on amortization expense is neutralized within a period of one year or less 
our estimate of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales experience with identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we track our subsequent sales realization  reassess the marketplace  and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust the amortization of our future catalogs  if necessary 
development costs we accumulate external and certain internal costs incurred in the development of our products which can include a master copy of a book  video or other media  on our balance sheet 
as of april   we had million in development costs and other  net  on our balance sheet 
a majority of these costs are associated with science and reading intervention businesses 
the capitalized development costs are subsequently amortized into cost of revenues over the expected sales realization cycle of the products  which is typically five years 
during fiscal  we amortized development costs of million to expense related to our continuing businesses 
we continue to monitor the expected sales realization cycle for each product  and will adjust the remaining expected life of the development costs or recognize an impairment  if warranted 
goodwill and intangible assets  and long lived assets at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
we review our goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other options 
as required by fasb asc topic  the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment  which includes judgments regarding financial projections  including forecasted cash flows and discount rates  and comparable market values 
as it relates to finite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules as required by fasb asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets which also requires significant judgments related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset 
key assumptions used in the impairment analysis include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  business plan projections  revenue growth rates  and the discount rate utilized for discounting such cash flows 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the estimated recoverability  or impairment  if any  of the asset 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
we test goodwill for possible impairment by determining the fair value of the company s reporting units 
we estimate fair value of the company s reporting units using a combined income discounted cash flow and market approach guideline public company comparables valuation model 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach 
a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are estimated based on past acquisition history and the company s assessment of the current and proposed valuations for related market transactions 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
the company s stock price and an estimated control premium are two factors that can significantly impact the fair value assessment of the company s reporting units 
the significant decline in the general global economic conditions has led to volatility in the company s stock price during fiscal and fiscal during this period  our stock price fluctuated between a high of per share and a low of per share 
as of april   the company s market capitalization was million  compared to a book value of million 
the company evaluated the movement in the stock price over the past fiscal year  along with the operating performance  cash flow performance and industry outlook 
significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
the company considers its market capitalization and estimated control premium in its goodwill impairment analysis 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying each factor to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill 
as a result of the analysis  the company determined that there was not a re consideration event that impacted the realizability of goodwill during fiscal the fair value of other indefinite life intangible assets are estimated and compared to the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief from royalty method  which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual budgets  assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the intangible assets  and a discount rate 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings under our credit facility and our discount expense related to our accounts receivable securitization were primarily dependent upon libor rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to have averaged basis points higher during fiscal and fiscal  pre tax earnings would have decreased by approximately million and million respectively 
this amount was determined by considering a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on average variable rate debt outstanding and the average advanced under the accounts receivable securitization facility during fiscal and fiscal the estimated fair value of long term debt approximated its carrying value at april  and april   with the exception of our convertible debt which at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million and at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million
