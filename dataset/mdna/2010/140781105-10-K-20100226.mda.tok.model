item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview carbo ceramics inc generates revenue primarily through the sale of products and services to the oil and gas industry 
the company s principal business consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant for use primarily in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
on august   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell a substantial portion of the assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  pinnacle technologies  inc pinnacle 
the sale  which includes all of the fracture and reservoir diagnostic business  the pinnacle name and related trademarks  was completed on october  the company has no continuing involvement in these operations 
the operations associated with this sale have been classified as income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and the cash flows associated with discontinued operations have been segregated in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company retained the hydraulic fracturing simulation software fracpropt  the hydraulic fracturing design  engineering and consulting business and applied geomechanics  inc  a provider of geotechnical monitoring applications 
on october   falcon technologies  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  purchased substantially all of the assets of bbl falcon industries  ltd  a supplier of spill prevention and containment systems for the oil and gas industry 
the acquisition was made for the purpose of expanding the company s product and service offerings to its existing client base 
falcon technologies uses proprietary technology to provide solutions that are designed to enable its clients to extend the life of their storage assets  reduce the potential for hydrocarbon spills and provide containment of stored materials 

table of contents the company s products and services help oil and gas producers increase production and recovery rates from their wells  thereby lowering overall reservoir development costs 
as a result  the company s business is dependent to a large extent on the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
however  the company has increased its revenues and income over a multiple year period and across various industry business cycles by increasing its share of the worldwide market for all types of proppant 
although the company s ceramic proppants are more expensive than alternative non ceramic proppants  the company has been able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products to numerous operators of oil and gas wells through increased technical marketing activity 
the company believes its future prospects benefit from both an increase in drilling activity worldwide and the desire of industry participants to improve production results and lower their overall development costs 
the company believes international operations will continue to represent an important role in its future growth 
in  the company constructed its first manufacturing facility located outside the united states in the city of luoyang  china and completed a second production line in that doubled the capacity of that facility 
in  the company also opened a sales office in moscow  russia and established distribution operations in the country 
in  the company broke ground on a new manufacturing facility in the city of kopeysk  russia and completed construction of this new facility during the first half of international revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
management believes the addition of new manufacturing capacity is critical to the company s ability to continue its long term growth in sales volume and revenue for ceramic proppant 
in regards to future expansion  the company is currently constructing a third production line at its toomsboro facility that is expected to be completed near the end of with an annual capacity of million pounds 
although the company has operated near or at full capacity at times during the previous ten years  the addition of significant new capacity could adversely impact operating profit margins if the timing of this new capacity does not match increases in demand for the company s products 
operating profit margin for the company s proppant business is principally impacted by manufacturing costs and the company s production levels as a percentage of its capacity 
although most direct production expenses have been relatively stable or predictable over time  the company has experienced recent volatility in the cost of natural gas  which is used in production by the company s domestic manufacturing facilities  and bauxite  which is the primary raw material for production of the company s high strength ceramic proppant 
the cost of natural gas has been a significant component of total monthly domestic direct production expense over the last three years 
in an effort to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas purchases and reduce exposure to short term spikes in the price of this commodity  the company contracts in advance for portions of its future natural gas requirements 
during  the company s long standing supplier of high strength raw materials exited the business 
these materials are used to manufacture high strength products  carboprop and carbohsp  at the mcintyre  georgia facility 
the delivered cost of bauxite  which represents approximately half of the cost of high strength products  has increased since the company s long standing supplier exited the business 
management anticipates its current supplies of bauxite will be sufficient for  but continues to pursue a long term source of these materials to complement its strong position in lightweight raw material supplies 
despite the efforts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices and the cost of high strength raw materials  it is possible that  given the significant portion of manufacturing costs represented by these items  gross margins as a percentage of sales may decline and changes in net income may not directly correlate to changes in revenue 
as the company has expanded its operations in both domestic and international markets  there has been an increase in activities and expenses related to marketing  distribution  research and development  and finance and administration 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in recent years 
in the future  the company expects to continue to actively pursue new business opportunities by increasing marketing activities globally  improving and expanding its distribution capabilities  and focusing on new product development 

table of contents the company expects that these activities will generate increased revenue  however selling  general and administrative expenses may continue to increase in from levels as the company continues to expand its operations 
general business conditions the company s proppant business is impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america  where the majority of wells are hydraulically fractured 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant is based on comparing the higher initial costs to the future value derived from increased production and recovery rates  the company s business is influenced by the current and expected prices of natural gas and oil 
worldwide oil and natural gas prices and related drilling activity levels remained very strong from until the second half of during the second half of  oil and natural gas prices as well as active drilling rigs in north america declined significantly in connection with declines in many of the world s economies 
although the north american drilling rig count improved during the second half of  it is not apparent as to whether this is the beginning of a recovery or a short term correction 
although difficult to predict  the company does not expect a long term impact for the company s products and services 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer generally upon delivery of products or at the time services are performed 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to three major customers  all of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in trade accounts receivable was attributable to those three customers 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of collectability risk and periodically evaluates the allowance based on a review of trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are periodically reviewed for collectability based on customers past credit history and current financial condition  and the allowance is adjusted  if necessary 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  the company s estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount and the allowance for doubtful accounts could be increased by a material amount 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million 
the company values inventory using the weighted average cost method 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to market value  as necessary 
future changes in demand and market conditions could cause the company to be exposed to additional obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional lower of cost or market adjustments may be required 
income taxes are provided for in accordance with asc topic  income taxes formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 

this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary 
table of contents differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
long lived assets  which include net property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangibles and other long term assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying values of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period
