contractual obligations the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts  such as debt agreements  lease agreements  unconditional purchase obligations  and other long term obligations 
the following table summarizes these obligations of the company as of september payments due by period total thereafter long term debt obligations debt maturities contractual interest capital leases operating leases pension obligations unconditional purchase obligations other liabilities total contractual obligations long term debt obligations the long term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long term debt  including current portion  and the related contractual interest obligations 
refer to note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long term debt 
contractual interest is the interest the company is contracted to pay on the long term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt  which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest 
the company had  of long term debt subject to variable interest rates at september  excluding fixed rate debt that has been swapped to variable rate debt 
the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at september variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us short term tax exempt interest rates 
leases refer to note  leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 
pension obligations the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the company that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities 
refer to note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements 
these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 
the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates  plan demographics  actual return on plan assets  continuation or modification of benefits  and other factors 
such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 
unconditional purchase obligations most of the company s long term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen  carbon monoxide  and syngas facilities 
the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas 
however  long term take or pay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply 
due to the matching of most long term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts  the company does not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the above unconditional purchase obligations include other product supply commitments and also electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations 
in addition  purchase commitments to spend approximately for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 
table of contents the company also purchases materials  energy  capital equipment  supplies  and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations 
the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy  which are obtained under requirements type contracts at market prices 
in total  purchases by the company approximate billion annually  including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 
other liabilities other liabilities includes the obligation to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of the french saga group saga for a fixed price of  or approximately  and the obligation to purchase of the remaining shares of cryoservice limited csl for in the second quarter of  the company entered into agreements that will enable it to acquire of the outstanding shares of saga 
under the terms of these agreements  the company purchased of the shares in march the remaining shares are expected to be purchased by the end of calendar year for a fixed price of  or approximately  under a put and call option structure 
at september  this structure was accounted for as a financing of the purchase of the remaining shares and reported within short term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet 
refer to note  business combinations  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
additionally  in june  the company entered into agreements obligating it to purchase of the remaining shares of csl 
the agreements require the consideration  which is based on a multiple of earnings formula  to be remitted in january at september  the liability amounted to and has been reported in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet

pension benefits the company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees 
the principal defined benefit pension plans the us salaried pension plan and the uk pension plan were closed to new participants in and were replaced with defined contribution plans 
the move to defined contribution plans has not had a material impact on retirement program cost levels or funding 
over the long run  however  the defined contribution plans are expected to reduce volatility of both expense and contributions 
for  the fair market value of pension plan assets for the company s defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to  from  in the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in the obligation was due principally to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to measure future benefit obligations to from

future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets  different from expected returns  would impact the actuarial gains losses and resulting amortization in years beyond pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans 
with respect to funded plans  the company s funding policy is that contributions  combined with appreciation and earnings  will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 
in addition  the company makes contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing its capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions 
the company analyzes the liabilities and demographics of each plan  which help guide the level of contributions

environmental matters the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs 
from time to time  the company is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act the federal superfund law  similar state laws  and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup 
the company s accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled   and in   and  respectively 
these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws  remedial activities  and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards 
future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts 
the amount included a charge of for the paulsboro site 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge 
the amount included revised cost estimates for several existing sites 
although precise amounts are difficult to determine  the company estimates that in both and  it spent approximately on capital projects to control pollution 
capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately in both and the company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from to a reasonably possible upper exposure of the consolidated balance sheets at september and included an accrual of and  respectively 
the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace  florida  piedmont  south carolina  and the paulsboro  new jersey facilities is included in these amounts 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 

table of contents actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in any one year 
some of the company s operations are within jurisdictions that have  or are developing  regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg 
these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme  mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta  canada  and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in california and ontario 
in the us  regional initiatives have been implemented that will regulate ghg emissions from fossil fuel driven power plants  and some federal legislative proposals also focus on such power plants 
as a large consumer of electric power  the company could be impacted by increased costs that may arise from such regulatory controls 
in addition  federal legislation has been introduced in the us that would regulate ghg emissions from the company s hydrogen facilities and other operations  such as production of fluorinated gases manufactured by the company 
in addition  the us environmental protection agency has taken preliminary actions towards regulating ghg emissions 
increased public awareness and concern may result in more international  us federal  and or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg 
the company may incur costs related to ghg emissions from its hydrogen facilities and other operations such as fluorinated gases production 
the company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through its contractual terms  but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate prediction of the long term impact on the company 
any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from company facilities could impact the company s growth by increasing its operating costs or reducing demand for certain of its products 
regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for the company 
the company continues to develop technologies to help its facilities and its customers lower energy consumption  improve efficiency  and lower emissions 
the company is also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere  enable cleaner transportation fuels  and facilitate alternate fuel source development 
in addition  the potential demand for clean coal and the company s carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen  one of the company s main products  and the company s proprietary technology for delivering low cost oxygen 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity 
the company does not have any derivative instruments indexed to its own stock 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
related party transactions the company s principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business 
the company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm s length with clearly independent parties 
inflation the consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with us gaap and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years inflation 
while the us inflation rate has been modest for several years  the company operates in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates 
the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations 
it is estimated that the cost of replacing the company s plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost 
accordingly  depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s major accounting policies 
judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the company s accounting policies in many areas 
however  application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires 
table of contents management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
the company s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with its audit committee 
depreciable lives of plant and equipment net plant and equipment at september totaled  and depreciation expense totaled during plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 
economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the company  which may be less than its physical life 
assumptions on the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  market demand  competitive position  raw material availability  and geographic location 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technology  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  the company would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
the company has numerous long term customer supply contracts  particularly in the gases on site business within the tonnage gases segment 
these contracts principally have initial contract terms of to years 
there are also long term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment 
these contracts principally have initial terms of to years 
depreciable lives of the production assets related to long term contracts are matched to the contract lives 
extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term 
as contract terms are extended  the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term 
the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally years 
customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term 
the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment  where there is not an associated long term supply agreement  range from to years 
these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances  potential obsolescence  competitors actions  etc 
management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 
a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated long term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below decrease life by year increase life by year merchant gases electronics and performance materials impairment of long lived assets plant and equipment plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long lived asset grouping  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition  a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping  or changes in the expected useful life of the long lived assets 
there were no such events or changes in circumstances that occurred during the reporting periods 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
if an asset group is determined to be 
table of contents impaired  the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group s fair value and its carrying value 
an estimate of the asset group s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce  inflation  etc 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
the company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires the company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity 
goodwill  including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of  was as of september the majority of the company s goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments 
disclosures related to goodwill are included in note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 
the company performs an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
in addition  goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists 
the impairment test requires the company to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value  including assigned goodwill 
the company has designated its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly 
currently  the company has four business segments and fifteen reporting units 
reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment 
the company determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value  and therefore there were no indications of impairment 
the company primarily uses an income approach valuation model  representing the present value of future cash flows  to determine fair value of a reporting unit 
the company s valuation model uses a five year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple 
management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business  long term contractual nature of the business  relatively consistent cash flows generated by the company s reporting units  and limited comparables within the industry 
the principal assumptions utilized in the company s income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate  operating profit margins  discount rate  and exit multiple 
revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in the company s operating plan and long term financial planning process 
the discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt  and expected equity premiums 
the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions 
also  the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption  which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions 
management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model  and actual results could differ from the estimates 
intangible assets intangible assets at september totaled and consisted primarily of customer relationships  purchased patents  and technology 
the company has no acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long lived asset grouping impairment tests 
impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
see impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 
equity investments investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled at september the majority of the company s investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business 
summarized 
table of contents financial information of equity affiliates is included in note  summarized financial information of equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements 
equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 
in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an impairment loss would be recognized 
management s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee 
changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate 
at september  accrued income taxes and deferred tax liabilities amounted to and  respectively 
tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of september were current and noncurrent deferred tax assets equaled at september income tax expense was for the year ended september management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates  depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
the company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 
deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards  these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense 
a point increase decrease in the company s effective tax rate would have decreased increased net income by approximately pension benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions 
the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 
actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans 
these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis  therefore  the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
the company determines assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and the rate of compensation increase 
note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted average basis for both the domestic and international plans 
the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality  and turnover rates 
the company believes the actuarial assumptions are reasonable 
however  actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement  mortality  and turnover 
one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate 
this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans 
the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date 
for the us plans  the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched with an interest rate curve applicable to the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate 
in making this 
table of contents determination  the company considers the yields on the citigroup pension discount curve and the citigroup above median pension discount curve  the general movement of interest rates  and the changes in those rates from one period to the next 
this rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense 
a basis point increase decrease in the discount rate decreases increases pension expense by approximately per year 
the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on an estimated weighted average of long term returns of major asset classes 
in determining asset class returns  the company takes into account long term returns of major asset classes  historical performance of plan assets  and related value of active management  as well as the current interest rate environment 
asset allocation is determined by an asset liability study that takes into account plan demographics  asset returns  and acceptable levels of risk 
lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense 
a basis point increase decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases increases pension expense by approximately per year 
the company uses a market related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses 
investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market related value of assets 
this method recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur  which reduces year to year volatility 
expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market related value of assets over the five year period 
the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption 
the company determines this rate based on review of the underlying long term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience  as well as comparison to peer companies 
a basis point increase decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases decreases pension expense by approximately per year 
loss contingencies in the normal course of business the company encounters contingencies  ie  situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the company 
the company accrues a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which the company s accounting policy is discussed in note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  and particulars are provided in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated 
these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time 
as additional information becomes available  the company reassesses probability and estimates of loss contingencies 
revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted 
for example  due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures  a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated  the scope of remediation is increased  or the company s proportionate share is increased 
similarly  a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on the company s net income in the period in which it is recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
it is the company s policy to minimize its cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 
the company mitigates adverse energy price impacts through its cost pass through contracts with customers  as well as price increases 
the company has also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oil based feedstocks 
there were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at september the company addresses these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies  see note  major accounting policies  and note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company s derivative and other financial instruments consist of long term debt including current portion  interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange option contracts  and commodity swaps 
the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position 
the net financial instrument position does not include available for sale securities of at september and at september as disclosed in note  fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements 
the available for sale securities in primarily included the investment in airgas stock of at september and  the net financial instrument position was a liability of  and  respectively 
the decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to a reduction in long term debt and the impact of a stronger us dollar on the translation of foreign currency long term debt 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
the range of changes chosen reflects the company s view of changes that are 
table of contents reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen 
the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by the company using a third party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates  spot and forward exchange rates  and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 
interest rate risk the company s debt portfolio  including swap agreements  as of september primarily comprised debt denominated in euros and us dollars  including the effect of currency swaps 
this debt portfolio is composed of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the company s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from the level at september  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 
based on the variable rate debt included in the company s debt portfolio  including the interest rate swap agreements  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional and of interest incurred per year at the end of september and  respectively 
a basis point decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by and per year at september and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at september and  with all other variables held constant
