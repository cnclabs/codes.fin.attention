item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for the years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are engaged in the provision of dna testing services that generate genetic profile information by analyzing an organism s unique genetic identity 
we focus our business on dna testing primarily for human identity and  to a lesser extent  agricultural applications 
in the human identity area  we principally provide dna testing services for forensic  family relationship and  to a lesser extent  security applications 
forensic dna testing is primarily used to confirm that a suspect committed a particular crime  to exonerate an innocent person or to establish or maintain databases of individuals convicted of crimes or  in some instances  arrested in connection with crimes 
we are also engaged in the provision of non dna forensic laboratory services 
family relationship dna testing is used to establish whether two or more people are genetically related 
dna testing is used by individuals and employers in security applications to establish or store a person s genetic profile for identification purposes in the event of an emergency or accident 
in agricultural applications  we provide dna testing services for selective trait breeding 
we have operations in the us and in the uk and the majority of our current customers are based in these two countries 
our forensic  family relationship and security dna testing services are conducted in both the us and the uk  while all of our agricultural dna testing services are conducted in the uk 
based on our review of publicly available information regarding contract sizes and competitor activity  supplemented by industry publications and third party market assessment data  we believe that the us and uk are two of the largest existing markets for dna testing services today 
in the us and uk  a significant amount of our current testing activity is under established non exclusive contracts with government agencies 
these contracts are usually awarded through a sealed bid process and  when awarded  typically have a term from one to three years 
we believe that our experience and reputation as a reliable provider of services to government agencies is a valued credential that can be used in securing both new contracts and renewing existing contracts 
our operations in the us accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continue to experience significant price competition in our forensics and paternity testing businesses 
as a result  we are focused on improving our operational execution to increase throughput in our laboratories and lower aggregate operating costs 
in particular  in our forensics business we have reduced our sample processing time and decreased the number of samples that need to be retested 
in addition  we believe that our forensic and paternity laboratory testing volumes  combined with the business that we acquired as part of the acquisition of reliagene have increased our operational efficiencies 
on october   we announced a planned consolidation of our east lansing  michigan paternity testing operations into our dayton  ohio facility 
on january   we announced a planned consolidation of our nashville  tennessee forensic dna testing facility into our dallas  texas facility 
we believe these consolidations may lead to additional operational efficiencies  plant and equipment cost reductions and increased scalability 
our operations in the uk accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
prior to  a significant portion of our uk revenues were derived through our agreement with lgc ltd  or lgc 
lgc is a provider of analytical and diagnostic services and one of our competitors in providing dna testing services in the uk 
our prior agreement with lgc was terminated effective july  and we then entered into a series of temporary extension agreements with lgc  which have terminated 
our focus is on providing our services directly to uk police forces 
in  we 
table of contents were successful in winning forensic work directly with uk police forces and  in february  we were awarded  overall  a significant portion of the service packages we bid on in the north west south west and wales regional tender 
we were awarded work from nine of the fourteen police forces that participated in this tender 
under the terms of the award  we are providing forensic services  including dna testing of database crime scene samples  forensic casework and database testing services under the uk s police and criminal evidence act  or pace  for multiple police forces that collectively tendered their work 
this award followed a rigorous and competitive bidding process 
we believe that the actions we have taken to date have enabled us to successfully transition from our prior reliance on revenues derived from lgc to directly providing these services to police forces in the uk 
in addition  we expect the remaining police forces in the uk to solicit initial tenders for forensic services through the uk s national procurement plan by the end of operating highlights our revenues are predominately generated from dna testing services provided to our customers 
our costs and expenses include costs of service revenues  research and development expenses  marketing and sales expenses  general and administrative expenses  amortization expense and other income and expense 
costs of service revenues consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees paid for the collection of samples  depreciation and facility expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our services 
marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits for marketing and sales personnel within our organization and all related costs of selling and marketing our services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  insurance and other corporate expenses 
our operating results improved for the year ended december  as compared to overall  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   total revenues increased approximately and gross margin  as percentage of service revenues  increased to approximately from approximately 
for the year ended december   as compared to  our uk revenues were unfavorably impacted approximately as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
excluding the adverse effect of exchange rate movements  in local currency terms we experienced an increase in revenue of  primarily due to increases in forensics  paternity and immigration testing services  partially offset by continued decreases in agriculture revenues 
in the us  we experienced increases in forensic casework  which was offset by decreases in testing services involving dna profile uploads into codis and individual state databases  as well as decreases in revenues for paternity testing services the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of service revenue  was the result of added sample volumes for our forensics testing services in the uk and forensics casework testing services in the us  as well as reductions in personnel and supply expenses 
for the year ended december   our operating expenses  other than cost of service revenues  decreased by approximately as compared to the same period in  as a result of decreased general and administrative and marketing and sales expenses  in particular decreased personnel costs and professional fees  as well as the impact of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar

revenues from our uk based testing services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for for the year ended december   as compared to  our uk revenues were unfavorably impacted approximately as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
despite the adverse effect of exchange rate movements  our uk based revenue increase was driven by an increase in forensics revenues  as work awarded under the north west south west and wales s regional tender and other work has replaced and surpassed revenues previously generated under our expired arrangement with lgc 
we previously performed forensic testing services for several police forces throughout the uk through our subcontractor agreement with lgc 
prior to  a significant portion of our uk revenues were derived through our agreement with lgc

table of contents during the years ended december  and  we recognized thousand and thousand  respectively  in other revenues  specifically license revenues attributable to a patent license agreement 
cost of service revenues cost of service revenues was million  or approximately of service revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or approximately of service revenues  for the year ended december  for year ended december   as compared to the comparable period in  our uk cost of service revenues were favorably impacted by approximately as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
in the us  cost of service revenues for year ended december   as compared to the comparable period in  decreased due to lower personnel costs and to lower lab supply costs as a result of process improvements 
our gross margin percentage increased by approximately four percentage points from for year ended december  to for the year ended december  this increase is a result of added sample volumes for our forensics testing services in the uk  productivity enhancements in the us and the uk  as well as reductions in personnel and supply expenses in the us 
on october   we announced a planned consolidation of our east lansing  michigan paternity testing operations into our dayton  ohio facility 
on january   we announced a planned consolidation of our nashville  tennessee forensic dna testing facility into our dallas  texas facility 
we believe these consolidations may lead to additional operational efficiencies  plant and equipment cost reductions and increased scalability 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were thousand  a decrease of thousand  as compared to thousand during the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to the impact of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of thousand as compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to decreased personnel  travel and postage costs and the impact of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million as compared to million during the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to decreased professional fees  including non recurring legal fees related to a sizable state paternity contract that was awarded to the company and protested by a competitor in and the impact of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
restructuring during the year ended december   we recognized thousand in restructuring expenses related to the consolidation of our east lansing  michigan paternity testing operations into our dayton  ohio facility 
we announced this planned consolidation on october  and expect to complete this consolidation and close the east lansing facility by july  the expenses in relate primarily to employee severance costs and facility closure costs 

table of contents we currently expect to incur restructuring charges and cash expenditures in connection with this consolidation of thousand to million in the aggregate  which includes severance and retention bonuses for employees in the range of thousand to thousand  relocation costs for employees relocating from the east lansing facility in the range of thousand to thousand  recruiting and training costs for the dayton facility in connection with the transfer of work from the east lansing facility of approximately thousand  lease termination costs in the range of thousand to  thousand and equipment relocation and reinstallation costs in the range of thousand to thousand 
a substantial portion of these charges and expenditures are expected to be reported in first and second quarters of we currently expect to offset these restructuring charges and expenditures through annual cost savings of approximately million from operational efficiencies  plant and equipment cost reductions and increased scalability 
a summary of the restructuring activity in is as follows in thousands workforce reduction facility costs total restructuring charges recorded in cash payments in restructuring liability as of december  on january  we announced the consolidation of our nashville  tennessee forensic dna testing facility into our dallas  texas facility 
we expect to complete this consolidation by august  we currently expect to incur restructuring charges and cash expenditures in connection with this action of million to million in the aggregate  which includes severance and retention bonuses for employees in the range of thousand to thousand  relocation costs for employees relocating from the nashville facility in the range of thousand to thousand  recruiting and training costs in our dallas facility in connection with the transfer of work from the nashville facility of approximately thousand  lease termination costs in the range of thousand to thousand and equipment relocation and reinstallation costs in the range of thousand to thousand 
a substantial portion of these charges are expected to be reported in the second  third and fourth quarters of we currently expect to offset these restructuring charges and expenditures through annual cost savings of approximately million from operational efficiencies  plant and equipment cost reductions and increased scalability 
amortization of intangible assets during each of the years ended december  and  we recorded million of amortization expense 
total other income  net interest income for the year ended december  was thousand  compared to thousand during the prior year 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates 
interest expense for the years ended december  and was thousand and thousand  respectively 
this interest expense was related to debt assumed as result of the acquisition of reliagene in the fourth quarter of other income for the year ended december  was thousand  primarily consisting of finance charges received on outstanding receivables 
other income for the year ended december  was thousand  primarily consisting of net non cash gains from changes in the fair value of certain liabilities 

table of contents income tax expense during the years ended december  and  we recorded an income tax benefit of thousand and million  respectively 
during  we recognized a current foreign tax expense of thousand 
included in this expense is a current benefit of thousand relating to certain allowances and deductions taken on our tax returns 
for the year ended december   we recognized a current foreign tax benefit of thousand  including a tax benefit of thousand due to a write down in our unrecognized income tax benefits  and a deferred foreign tax benefit of thousand  primarily for our business in the uk  as well as a tax benefit of million associated with the sale of some of our state nol carryforwards 
no tax benefit was recorded relating to our us business losses as management deemed that it was not likely than such tax benefit would be realized 
net loss for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  which represented a decrease of as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our net loss for the years ended december  and change change in thousands total revenues cost of service revenues research and development marketing and sales general and administrative restructuring expense benefit amortization of intangible assets total other income  net income tax benefit expense net loss revenues total revenues for the year ended december  of million represented a decrease of approximately million  or approximately  as compared to revenues of million for our us service revenues for the year ended december  of million increased by thousand  or approximately  as compared to million for  primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of reliagene and increased volume in our government paternity testing services 
the increases in government paternity revenues were partly offset by declines in revenues from our forensic casework testing and codis services due to lower average selling price per sample as a result of significant price competition and from our private paternity testing services due to lower volume 
revenues from our uk based testing services decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for for the year ended 
table of contents december   as compared to  our uk revenues were unfavorably impacted approximately as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
excluding the adverse effect of exchange rate movements  our uk based revenues declined due to decreased volume in agricultural and immigration testing services 
these decreases were partially offset by increased forensics revenues in local currency terms  as work awarded under the north west south west and wales regional tender and pilot work has replaced revenues previously generated under our expired lgc agreement 
we previously performed forensic testing services for several police forces throughout the uk through our subcontractor agreement with lgc 
revenues derived through the lgc agreement accounted for approximately and of our total revenues and approximately and of our uk revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our agreement with lgc was terminated effective july  and we then entered into a series of temporary extension agreements with lgc 
lgc is now providing dna testing services directly to several police forces in the uk that were previously serviced by us on a subcontract basis 
we continue to provide some dna testing services to police forces through lgc on a limited basis 
we also continue to focus on providing our services directly to uk police forces 
in  we were successful in winning forensic work with different uk police forces and  in february  we were awarded  overall  a significant portion of the service packages we bid on in the north west south west and wales regional tender 
we were awarded work from nine of the fourteen police forces that participated in this tender 
under the terms of the award  we are providing forensic services  including dna testing of database crime scene samples  forensic casework and pace samples for multiple police forces that collectively tendered their work 
this award followed a rigorous and competitive bidding process 
in addition  we expect the remaining police forces in the uk to tender their work through the uk s national procurement plan 
we submitted our first tender under the national procurement plan in the first quarter of  with tendering expected to continue through a month period 
under the terms of our agreement with the defra  we conducted genotyping services offered to sheep farmers under the nsp  which was designed to help british farmers breed sheep with reduced genetic susceptibility to the disease 
our agreement with defra expired in march defra will continue to have a requirement for scrapie genotyping for monitoring purposes but at a much reduced volume and it is uncertain that we will be awarded the contract for such testing 
therefore we expect our future agricultural testing services revenues will not be significant to our operating results 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized thousand and thousand  respectively  in other revenues  specifically license revenues 
cost of service revenues cost of service revenues was million  or approximately of service revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or approximately of service revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of service revenues primarily reflects increased laboratory personnel costs  partially offset by decreased depreciation expense 
our gross margin  as a percentage of service revenue  decreased from for the year ended december  to for year ended december  the decrease in gross margin percentage was the result of the adverse impact of lower margin forensics revenues replacing the dna testing volumes related to the loss of former lgc business  the buildup of casework management capabilities in the uk to service the business we won under the north west south west and wales regional tender prior to performing services and generating revenues under the new contracts  and reduced sample volumes for our uk based forensic  agricultural and immigration testing services 
a decrease in average selling price per sample in our us forensic casework and codis testing services also negatively impacted the gross margin 
for the year ended december   as compared to  our uk cost of service revenues decreased by approximately as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were thousand  a decrease of thousand  as compared to million during the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to reduced personnel and supplies costs 
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of thousand as compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to decreased personnel  travel and postage costs 
the decrease was partially offset by increased web related advertising costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of thousand  as compared to million during the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased professional fees  including non recurring legal fees related to a sizable state paternity contract that was awarded to us and protested by a competitor 
these increases in professional fees were partially offset by decreases in personnel costs  consulting  relocation and insurance expenses 
restructuring we recorded a restructuring benefit of thousand for the year ended december  as a result of favorable settlement of an employee obligation that was accrued at december  amortization of intangible assets during the years ended december  and  we recorded and million of amortization expense  respectively 
the increase in amortization expense is due to the acquisition of additional intangible assets as part of our acquisition of reliagene in the fourth quarter of total other income  net interest income for the year ended december  was thousand  compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates and average cash balances in interest expense for the years ended december  and was thousand and thousand  respectively 
this interest expense was related to debt assumed as result of the acquisition of reliagene in the fourth quarter of other income for the year ended december  was thousand  primarily consisting of net non cash gains from changes in the fair value of a lease guarantee and penalty payment accrual  partially offset by a royalty liability expense 
other income for the year ended december  was thousand  primarily a result of a non cash gain from a reduction in the fair value of a lease guarantee liability  partially offset by accruals of certain non operating expenses 
income tax expense during the years ended december  and  we recorded an income tax benefit of million and an income tax expense of thousand  respectively 

table of contents for the year ended december   we recognized a current foreign tax benefit of thousand  including a tax benefit of thousand due to a write down in our unrecognized income tax benefits  and a deferred foreign tax benefit of thousand  primarily for our business in the uk  as well as a tax benefit of million associated with the sale of some of our state nol carryforwards 
no tax benefit was recorded relating to our us business losses as management deemed that it was not likely than such tax benefit would be realized 
for the year ended december   we recognized current foreign tax expense of million and deferred foreign tax expense of thousand  primarily for our profitable business in the uk 
in addition  we recorded a tax benefit of million associated with the sale of some of our state nol carryforwards 
no tax benefit was recorded relating to our us business losses as management deemed that it was not likely than such tax benefit would be realized 
net loss for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  which represented an increase of as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as compared to million as of december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase in working capital was primarily a result of the effect cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  as of december   we had no short or long term debt obligations 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity have been issuances of our securities and other capital raising activities 
the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and in thousands change change cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million  compared with net cash used in operations of approximately million for the prior year 
the change in operating cash flows was mainly a result of a decreased net loss and an increase in our accounts receivable for the year ended december  as compared to investing activities during the year ended december  of million primarily consisted of million for the purchase of available for sale securities  as well as thousand in capital expenditures as compared to investing activities during the year ended december  of million  primarily consisting of million in capital expenditures  partially offset by the release of thousand of restricted cash 
financing activities during the year ended december  and primarily consisted of repayments of debt obligations of and thousand  respectively 
reliagene debt as part of the acquisition of reliagene on october   we assumed thousand in debt comprised of a line of credit and various notes payable with outstanding balances of thousand and thousand  
table of contents respectively 
the line of credit was fully paid off during with a then outstanding balance of thousand 
the notes payable  which were secured by reliagene s equipment  had interest rates ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from june  through september  in april  we fully paid off the reliagene notes payable  along with all accrued interest 
expected uses of liquidity in throughout  we plan to continue making investments in our business 
we expect the following to be significant uses of liquidity cost of service revenues  salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees for the collection of samples  facility expenses  marketing expenses and general and administrative costs 
actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates 
we also expect to make capital expenditures related to the expansion of our dallas facility to build a new codis laboratory and the expansion of our uk facilities in abingdon and chorley 
in addition  we may make additional investments in future acquisitions of businesses or technologies which would increase our capital expenditures 
we believe that our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next twelve months 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund future growth opportunities or to operate our ongoing business activities if our future results of operations fall below our expectations 
however  we may not be able to raise additional funds or raise funds on terms that are acceptable to us 
if future financing is not available to us  or is not available on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
if we raise funds through equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution and our stock price may decline 
we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
we also may need additional capital if we seek to acquire other businesses or technologies 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we maintained multiple contractual commitments as of december  which will support our future business operations 
such commitments relate to noncancelable operating lease arrangements  debt obligations and a lease guarantee 
we have identified and quantified the most significant of these commitments in the following table 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations such amounts represent future minimum rental commitments for office space and equipment leased under noncancelable operating lease arrangements 
in connection with the sale of assets and liabilities of our diagnostics business to tepnel life sciences  plc  or tepnel  in  we were required to sign an unconditional guarantee related to the lease for the stamford  connecticut based laboratory  which was assigned to tepnel 
the fair value of the guarantee amounted zero as of december  we valued the guarantee based on the existing terms and conditions of the lease  an estimated vacancy period of the space prior to subleasing the space  and the likelihood of tepnel breaching its obligation under the assigned lease 
the lease terminates in april of minimum remaining rents under the 
table of contents assigned lease totaled zero and thousand as of december  and  respectively 
based on tepnel s continuing performance under the sublease and a review of risks associated with the guarantee  in  we revised our estimate for the tepnel lease guarantee 
as a result  we recorded a benefit of thousand for the year ended december   included in other income  net 
in december  we executed an asset purchase agreement with an acquiring party  pursuant to which we sold such acquiring party certain assets related to our snps and snpstream business 
included in the assets sold was a license agreement between us and a licensee  including the royalties due under such license 
since december  the licensee continued to send royalty payments of approximately thousand per year under the license to us 
such royalty payments are in the aggregate amount of thousand  including thousand received during the three months ended september  but not recorded as revenue 
in the third quarter of  the acquiring party demanded that we pay the royalties received under the license with the licensee and that we direct the licensee to send all future royalty payments and royalty reports to the acquiring party 
we gave such directions to the licensee on october  on november  we paid the acquiring party thousand in settlement of such claim 
several of our operating leases contain clauses that could require us to restore the leased premises to their original condition 
based upon the nature of our leasehold improvements and historical experience in exiting leases with similar clauses  we believe there is a minimal probability of us incurring a material restoration expense and as such  we have not recorded an accrual for these obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
limitation on the use of our nol carryforwards new jersey nol program we sold certain state net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards in accordance with the state of new jersey s corporation business tax benefit certificate transfer program  or the program  and generated cash benefits of million  million and thousand for  and  respectively 
the program allowed certain high technology and biotechnology companies to sell unused nol carryforwards to other new jersey based corporation business taxpayers 
the carryforward period for our pre qualified losses under this program expired january  as of december   we have million and million of federal and state nol carryforwards  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
some of the federal and state nol carryforwards that we have generated or acquired have begun to expire 
utilization of our nol carryforwards to offset future taxable income  if any  may be substantially limited due to the change of ownership provisions in the tax reform act of  or the act 
the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of nol carryforwards and research and development credits following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act  which could significantly limit our ability to utilize or sell these carryforwards and research and development credits 
we have determined that an ownership change  as defined by the act  occurred in and as a result million of our nol carryforwards are limited 
we may have experienced other ownership changes as a result of past financings and may experience others in connection with future financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned federal nol carryforwards may be further limited 
at december   we had new jersey research and development and federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of million  which will begin expiring in and  respectively 
as a result of our acquisitions of genescreen  inc and lifecodes corporation  we acquired federal nol carryforwards of million and million  respectively  of which million has expired 
we also may receive tax benefits in the future relating to stock option deductions that will not be reflected in the results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition stock based compensation valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets income taxes revenue recognition we recognize dna laboratory services revenues at the time test results are completed and reported  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
deferred revenues represent the unearned portion of payments received in advance of tests being completed and reported 
unbilled receivables represent revenue which has been earned on completed and reported tests  but has not been billed to the customer 
revenues from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations of the licensee  as well as patent license agreements  are recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have no significant continuing involvement under the terms of the arrangement 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the performance period  which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses reported in any given period 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  statement of financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
r  share based payment  or fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we have applied the modified prospective method of adoption  under which prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
under the modified prospective method  fas r applies to new awards and to awards that were outstanding as of december  that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  includes expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and expense for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
stock based compensation is classified within cost of service revenues  research and development  marketing and sales and general and administrative on the consolidated statement of operations 
stock options granted to employees  which are granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant  in general vest in four years in equal monthly installments and have a maximum term of ten years 
stock options granted to our board of directors in general vest in three years in equal monthly installments and have a maximum term of ten years 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  the number of options that will ultimately not vest and the expected dividend yield 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the 
table of contents expected volatility assumption is based on the daily historical volatility of our stock price  over the expected term of the option 
our stock options are considered plain vanilla options based on the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 share based payment  or sab  as amended by sab no 
 share based payment  or sab  and as such we have elected to use the simplified method  whereby we have assumed that all options will be exercised midway between the vesting date and the contractual term of the option to determine the expected term of the option 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with sab  as amended by sab we have not paid dividends since our inception  nor do we expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future  thus the expected dividend yield assumption is zero 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or between annual tests in the presence of impairment indicators such as significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof  significant decrease in the market value of our common stock  and a significant decrease in the market value of the assets 
judgment is required in determining the existence of these factors and its effect on any impairment determination 
the fair value of our reporting units is determined considering the income  the market or the transaction valuation approaches or a combination thereof 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of the reporting unit s expected estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
under the transaction approach  the value of the reporting unit is based on market transactions of similar businesses 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the purposes of our annual or interim analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows  operating trends  discount rates  and other variables of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 

table of contents our other long lived assets consist primarily of fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets 
we review other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
recoverability of other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset asset group to estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we performed an annual assessment of goodwill as of december  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
we performed an impairment assessment of our long lived assets as of december  and concluded that our long lived assets were not impaired 
income taxes we have generated nol carryforwards for tax purposes since inception 
as of december   these nol carryforwards have resulted in nol carryforwards of million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
in addition  certain charges recorded in the current and prior years were not currently deductible for income tax purposes 
these differences result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities  will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of nol carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets for which a valuation has been recorded  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then record income taxes on our us operations at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately

in addition  the us taxing authorities may examine the tax years from the company s inception in through  but generally are barred from adjusting the tax liabilities in excess of the net operating losses generated in any of those tax years 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate is thousand

table of contents while management makes its best efforts to be accurate in making forward looking statements  such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially  including the risks and uncertainties discussed throughout this annual report on form k and the cautionary information set forth under the heading risk factors appearing in item a of this annual report on form k 
we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents  which are conservative in nature  with a focus on preservation of capital 
due to the short term nature of our investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not material to our business 
as of december   we had no short term or long term debt obligations 
foreign currency risk our business derives a substantial portion of its revenues from international operations 
we record the majority of our foreign operational transactions  including all cash inflows and outflows  in the local currency  british pound 
we record all of our us operational transactions  including cash inflows and outflows  in us dollars 
we expect that international sales may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
the significant percentage of our revenue derived from our uk operations makes us vulnerable to future fluctuations in the exchange rate 
for the year ended december   as compared to  our uk revenues were unfavorably impacted approximately  as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and future material adverse exchange rate movements would have an additional unfavorable translation impact on our consolidated financial results 
we are prepared to hedge against any fluctuations in foreign currencies should such fluctuations have a material economic impact on us  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date
