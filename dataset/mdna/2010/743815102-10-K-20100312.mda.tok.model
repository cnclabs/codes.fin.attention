home and community based services revenue for and included approximately million and million of revenue  respectively  under our annual block purchase contract in excess of the annual funding allocation amount 
in  we reserved approximately million of the aggregate revenue accrued in and noted in footnote above under our annual block purchase contract in excess of the annual funding allocation amount 
on april   we completed a follow on offering of common stock in connection with which we sold  shares at an offering price of per share  which included the full exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discounts of million  but before deducting other offering costs totaling approximately  on april   we prepaid approximately million of the principal and accrued interest then outstanding related to our credit facility with cit healthcare llc out of the net proceeds from our follow on offering of common stock completed on april  in february  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program whereby we may repurchase shares of our common stock from the open market from time to time 
as of december   we spent approximately million to purchase  shares of our common stock in the open market under this program 
the shares of our common stock repurchased were placed into treasury 
no shares of our common stock were repurchased under this program during and as a result of our acquisition activity during  we incurred approximately million of debt obligations by issuing million of the subordinated notes and drawing down million under our credit and guaranty agreement with cit healthcare llc 
due to the significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization and the uncertainty in the state payer environment as well as the impact of related budgetary decisions on our earnings  we initiated asset impairment tests and  based on the results  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling approximately million related to our goodwill and other intangible assets for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  we prepaid million of our term loan debt under the credit and guaranty agreement  as amended 
our current and long term debt obligations decreased to approximately million at december  from million at december  non emergency transportation services revenue for was positively impacted by the effect of membership increases related to new and existing contracts and negotiated rate increases throughout a number of contracts due to increased utilization  program enhancements and future projected program costs 
in addition  utilization of our education and other school based programs increased significantly in compared to the utilization levels in for a more detailed discussion of the effects of the events noted above on our revenue and operating margin for as compared to  see the year to year analysis included in item management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations of this report 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  entitled  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  including but not limited to those set forth in item a  entitled  risk factors and elsewhere in this report may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
overview of our business we provide government sponsored social services directly and through not for profit social services organizations whose operations we manage  and we arrange for and manage non emergency transportation services 
as a result of and in response to the large and growing population of eligible beneficiaries of government sponsored social services and non emergency transportation services  increasing pressure on governments to control costs and increasing acceptance of privatized social services  we have grown both organically and by consummating strategic acquisitions 
we have implemented several strategic initiatives to enhance stockholder value such as growing our core social services and non emergency transportation management services businesses  reducing corporate and client service costs as a percentage of revenue and reducing our debt 
as a result  we have accomplished the following growing our core social services business 
in february  we were awarded a us million three year contract in canada to operate a work force development program for returning veterans and two new annual contracts in california aggregating million per year to operate adult mental health wellness centers 
focusing on our core competencies in the delivery of home and community based counseling  foster care and not for profit managed services  we believe we are well positioned to offer the highest quality and much needed services to state and local governments and our clients 
our goal is to be the primary provider of choice to the social services industry 
growing our non emergency transportation management services business 
commencing in february and continuing throughout  we added hmo commercial and medicaid contracts in hawaii  nevada  arizona and california 
in april  we were awarded a five year contract in the state of new jersey to provide non emergency transportation services 
hiring of chief strategy officer 
in  we appointed a chief strategy officer  who will be responsible for identifying new markets and new opportunities  develop and execute business and marketing plans and assist our field offices in initiating strategies designed to align local operations with developing payer funding initiatives 
reducing corporate and client costs as a percentage of revenue 
we took several steps to increase our profitability by decreasing our operating expenses 
we implemented an across the board wage freeze and made reductions in vacation  sick and holiday pay effective as of january   health care benefit reductions were made effective as of july   we reduced our workforce in certain operations in pennsylvania and north carolina  and  in selected markets  we decreased the use of fixed salaried personnel in favor of hourly employees 
the across the board wage freeze was in effect for beginning in january  we have begun phasing out the wage freeze and providing our employees with wage increases based on our compensation policy 
amending financial covenants and reducing our debt 
as a result of consummating certain acquisitions we have significant contractual obligations  including financial covenant requirements  related to our long term debt for the fiscal year and beyond 
to address our liquidity concerns related to our ability to meet our financial covenant requirements  we entered into an amendment to our credit and guaranty agreement with cit capital securities llc  or cit  on march  to  among other things  change 
table of contents those requirements as more fully described below under the heading entitled liquidity and capital resources 
as a result of this amendment  we believe that we will meet all of our financial covenant requirements although there can be no guarantee that we will and that we have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations for the months ending december  in addition  we prepaid million of our term loan debt under the credit and guaranty agreement  as amended  in the fourth quarter of and million in january as more fully described below under the heading entitled liquidity and capital resources 
we believe our business model of not owning beds or fleets of vehicles enables us to be nimble in the face of recent uncertain market conditions 
we are focused on legislative trends both at the federal and state levels as current economic conditions have renewed the push for healthcare reform 
the passage of healthcare reform legislation could accelerate the demand for our services 
in addition  we have seen improvements with government payers aided by federal stimulus funds and federal court intervention in the california medicaid debate 
while we believe we are well positioned to benefit from healthcare reform and to offer our services to a growing population of individuals eligible to receive our services  there can be no assurances that favorable healthcare reform will be passed or that programs under which we provide our services will receive continued or increased funding 
our direct client census related to our social services contracts remained relatively consistent from to at over  with increases in federally funded programs such as workforce development and medicaid offset by declines in state funded business and foster care 
in  we ceased providing services to a managed entity which primarily accounted for a decrease in our managed client census from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  as of december   there were approximately million individuals eligible to receive services under our non emergency transportation services contracts 
we provided services to our clients from locations in states  the district of columbia and british columbia 
our working capital requirements are primarily funded by cash from operations and borrowings from our credit facility with cit  which provides funding for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
how we grow our business and evaluate our performance our business grows internally through organic expansion into new markets  increases in the number of clients served under contracts we or the entities we manage are awarded  and externally through acquisitions 
we typically pursue organic expansion into markets that are contiguous to our existing markets or where we believe we can quickly establish a significant presence 
when we expand organically into a market  we typically have no clients or perform no management services in the market and are required to incur start up costs including the costs of space  required permits and initial personnel 
these costs are expensed as incurred and our new offices can be expected to incur losses for a period of time until we adequately grow our revenue from clients or management fees 
we also pursue strategic acquisitions in markets where we see opportunities but where we lack the contacts and or personnel to make a successful organic entry 
unlike organic expansion which involves start up costs that may dilute earnings  expansion through acquisitions have generally been accretive to our earnings 
however  we bear financing risk and where debt is used  the risk of leverage by expanding through acquisitions 
we also must integrate the acquired business into our operations which could disrupt our business and we may not be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration 
finally  our acquisitions involve purchase prices in excess of the fair value of tangible assets and cash or receivables 
this excess purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and is subject to periodic evaluation and impairment or other write downs that are charges against our earnings 

table of contents in all our markets we focus on several key performance indicators in managing our business 
specifically  we focus on growth in the number of clients served  as that particular metric is the key driver of our revenue growth 
we also focus on the number of employees and the amount of outsourced transportation cost as these items are our most important variable costs and the key to the management of our operating margins 
acquisitions we continue to selectively identify and pursue attractive acquisition opportunities 
there are no assurances  however  that we will complete acquisitions in the future or that any completed acquisitions will prove profitable for us 
how we earn our revenue we operate in two segments social services and non emergency transportation services  or net services 
social services our revenue is derived from our provider contracts with state and local government agencies and government intermediaries  hmo s  commercial insurers  and from our management contracts with not for profit social services organizations 
the government entities that pay for our services include welfare  child welfare and justice departments  public schools and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of the contracts where we provide social services directly  we are paid an hourly fee 
in other such situations  we receive a set monthly amount or we are paid amounts equal to the costs we incur to provide agreed upon services 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as either revenue from home and community based services or foster care services 
where we contract to manage the operations of not for profit social services organizations  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenue of the managed entity or a predetermined fee 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as management fees 
because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and our management fees are largely dependent upon their revenues  we also monitor for management and disclosure purposes the revenues of the entities we manage 
we refer to the revenues of these entities as managed entity revenue 
net services where we provide management services for non emergency transportation  we contract with state medicaid and local agencies  regional and medical hospital systems or private managed care companies 
most of our contracts for non emergency transportation management services are capitated where we are paid on a per member per month basis for each eligible member 
we do not direct bill for services under our capitated contracts as our revenue is based on covered lives 
our special needs school transportation contracts are with local governments and are paid on a per trip basis or per bus per day basis 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as non emergency transportation services revenue 
fasb codification discussion we follow accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board  commonly referred to as the fasb 
the fasb establishes accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
over the years  the fasb and other designated gaap setting bodies  have issued standards in the form of fasb statements  interpretations  fasb staff positions  eitf consensuses  aicpa statements of position  etc 
the fasb recognized the complexity of its standard setting process and embarked on a revised process in that culminated in the release on july   of the fasb accounting standards codification  sometimes 
table of contents referred to as the codification or asc 
the codification does not change how we account for our transactions or the nature of related disclosures made 
in addition  the codification does not replace or affect authoritative accounting and reporting guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  or its staff for public companies in their filings with the sec 
however  when referring to guidance issued by the fasb  we refer to topics in the asc rather than fasb statements or eitf consensuses  etc 
the above change was made effective by the fasb for periods ending on or after september  we have updated references to gaap in this report on form k to reflect the guidance in the codification 
critical accounting policies and estimates general in preparing our financial statements in accordance with gaap  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued transportation costs  accounting for management agreement relationships  loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs  stock based compensation  foreign currency translation  derivative instruments and hedging activities and income taxes 
we have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with our board of directors  audit committee and disclosure committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time services are rendered at predetermined amounts stated in our contracts and when the collection of these amounts is considered to be reasonably assured 
at times we may receive funding for certain services in advance of services actually being rendered 
these amounts are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until the actual services are rendered 
as services are rendered  documentation is prepared describing each service  time spent  and billing code under each contract to determine and support the value of each service provided 
this documentation is used as a basis for billing under our contracts 
the billing process and documentation submitted under our contracts vary among our payers 
the timing  amount and collection of our revenues under these contracts are dependent upon our ability to comply with the various billing requirements specified by each payer 
failure to comply with these requirements could delay the collection of amounts due to us under a contract or result in adjustments to amounts billed 
the performance of our contracts is subject to the condition that sufficient funds are appropriated  authorized and allocated by each state  city or other local government 
if sufficient appropriations  authorizations and allocations are not provided by the respective state  city or other local government  we are at risk of immediate termination or renegotiation of the financial terms of our contracts 
social services segment fee for service contracts 
revenue related to services provided under fee for service contracts is recognized at the time services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
such services are provided at established billing rates 
fee for service contracts represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents cost based service contracts 
revenue from our cost based service contracts is recorded based on a combination of direct costs  indirect overhead allocations  and stated contractual margins on those costs 
these revenues are compared to annual contract budget limits and  depending on reporting requirements  allowances may be recorded for certain contingencies such as projected costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or insufficient encounters 
this policy results in recognizing revenue from these contracts based on allowable costs incurred 
the annual contract amount is based on projected costs to provide services under the contracts with adjustments for changes in the total contract amount 
we annually submit projected costs for the coming year which assist the contracting payers in establishing the annual contract amount to be paid for services provided under the contracts 
after the contracting payers year end  we submit cost reports which are used by the contracting payers to determine the amount  if any  by which funds paid to us for services provided under the contracts were greater than the allowable costs to provide these services 
completion of this review process may take several years from the date we submit the cost report 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under contract  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our cost reports are routinely audited by our payers on an annual basis 
we periodically review our provisional billing rates and allocation of costs and provide for estimated adjustments from the contracting payers 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made in our consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any cost report audits 
differences between the amounts provided and the settlement amounts  which historically have not been material  are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in the year of settlement 
cost based service contracts represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
annual block purchase contract 
our annual block purchase contract with the community partnership of southern arizona  referred to as cpsa  requires us to provide or arrange for behavioral health services to eligible populations of beneficiaries as defined in the contract 
we must provide a complete range of behavioral health clinical  case management  therapeutic and administrative services 
we are obliged to provide services only to those clients with a demonstrated medical necessity 
our annual funding allocation amount is subject to increase when our encounters exceed the contract amount  however  such increases in the annual funding allocation amount are subject to government appropriation and may not be approved 
there is no contractual limit to the number of eligible beneficiaries that may be assigned to us  or a specified limit to the level of services that may be provided to these beneficiaries if the services are deemed to be medically necessary 
therefore  we are at risk if the costs of providing necessary services exceed the associated reimbursement 
we are required to regularly submit service encounters to cpsa electronically 
on an on going basis and at the end of cpsa s june fiscal year  cpsa is obligated to monitor the level of service encounters 
if the encounter data is not sufficient to support the year to date payments made to us  unless waived  cpsa has the right to prospectively reduce or suspend payments to us 
for revenue recognition purposes  our service encounter value which represents the value of actual services rendered must equal or exceed of the revenue recognized under our annual block purchase contract for the contract year 
the remaining of revenue recognized in each reporting period represents payment for network overhead administrative costs incurred in order to fulfill our obligations under the contract 
administrative costs include  but are not limited to  intake services  clinical liaison oversight for each behavioral health recipient  cultural liaisons  financial assessments and screening  data processing and information systems  staff training  quality and utilization management functions  coordination of care and subcontract administration 
we recognize revenue from our annual block purchase contract corresponding to the service encounter value 
if our service encounter value is less than of the amounts received from cpsa for the contract year  unless waived  we recognize revenue equal to the service encounter value and defer revenue for any excess amounts received 
cpsa has not reduced  withheld  or suspended any payments that have not been subsequently reimbursed 
we believe our encounter data is sufficient to have earned all amounts recorded as revenue under this contract 

table of contents if our service encounter value equals of the amounts received from cpsa for the contract year  we recognize revenue at the contract amount  which is one twelfth of the established annual contract amount each month 
if our service encounter value exceeds of the contract amount  we recognize revenue in excess of the annual funding allocation amount if collection is reasonably assured 
we evaluate factors regarding payment probability related to the determination of whether any such additional revenue over the contractual amount is considered to be reasonably assured 
the terms of the contract may be reviewed prospectively and amended as necessary to ensure adequate funding of our contractual obligations  however  we cannot guarantee amendments will be completed 
our revenues under the annual block purchase contract for the years ended december  and represented approximately of our social services operating segment revenues for both years 
management agreements 
we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations whereby we provide certain management services for these organizations 
in exchange for our services  we receive a management fee that is either based on a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
management fees earned under our management agreements represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the costs associated with generating our management fee revenue are accounted for in client service expense and in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
net services segment capitation contracts 
approximately of our non emergency transportation services revenue is generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the transportation needs of a specific geographic population 
revenues under capitation contracts with our payers result from per member monthly fees based on the number of participants in our payer s program 
aggregate revenue from our top five payers for the year ended december  and represented approximately and  respectively  of our net services operating segment revenue for such period 
fee for service contracts 
revenues earned under fee for service contracts are recognized when the service is provided 
revenue under these types of contracts is based upon contractually established billing rates less allowance for contractual adjustments 
estimates of contractual adjustments are based upon payment terms specified in the related agreements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts clients are referred to us through governmental social services programs and we only provide services at the direction of a payer under a contractual arrangement 
these circumstances have historically minimized any uncollectible amounts for services rendered 
however  we recognize that not all amounts recorded as accounts receivable will ultimately be collected 
we record all accounts receivable amounts at their contracted amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk that an account will not be collected 
we regularly evaluate our accounts receivable  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
we pay particular attention to amounts outstanding for days and longer 
any account receivable older than days is deemed uncollectible and written off or fully reserved unless we have specific information from the payer that payment for 
table of contents those amounts is forthcoming or other evidence which we believe supports the collection of amounts older than days 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific payer s inability to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific addition to our allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
under certain of our contracts  billings do not coincide with revenue recognized on the contract due to payer administrative issues 
these unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recorded for which no amount has been invoiced and for which we expect an invoice will not be provided to the payer within the normal billing cycle 
all unbilled amounts are expected to be billed within one year 
our write off experience for the years ended december  and was approximately of revenue 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets when we consummate an acquisition we separately value all acquired identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill in accordance with asc topic business combinations  or asc we analyze the carrying value of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year 
in connection with our year end asset impairment test  we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization including a reasonable control premium 
as part of this annual impairment test  we also compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  there is an indication of impairment 
if an indication of impairment is identified  the impairment loss  if any  is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
similarly conducted interim impairment tests may also be required in advance of our annual impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value  including goodwill  of one or more of our reporting units below the reporting unit s carrying value 
such circumstances could include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the climate of our business  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in determining whether or not we had goodwill impairment to report for the year ended december  and  we considered both a market based valuation approach and an income based valuation approach when estimating the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill balances as of such dates 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using one or more methods based on current values in the market for similar businesses 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the cash flow streams expected to be generated by the reporting unit over an appropriate period and then discounting the cash flows to present value using an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimates of future revenue and expenses  growth rates and discount rates 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows  including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises  market conditions change or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding whether existing goodwill is impaired could change and result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
based on the results of our asset impairment test completed as of december   we determined that none of our goodwill was impaired 
the fair value of one of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
as of december   the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit was approximately million 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on estimates of future revenue and expenses 
table of contents incorporated in our current operating plans  growth rates and discounts rates  our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations 
significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with revenue growth  profitability  and related cash flows 
the discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting units 
we also considered assumptions that market participants may use 
by their nature  these projections and assumptions are uncertain 
potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the lack of sufficient funds allocated by our state and local government payers to compensate us for the level of services we currently provide or the potential increased level of service we may be required to provide in the future due to the impact of the current economic downturn  and loss of a significant contract 
the fair values of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 
based on the results of our impairment tests completed as of september  interim and december  annual  we recorded a total goodwill impairment charge for the year ended december  of million  which is included in asset impairment charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
of this non cash impairment charge  approximately million was related to our social services operating segment and approximately million was related to our net services operating segment 
in connection with our acquisitions  we allocate a portion of the purchase consideration to management contracts  customer relationships  restrictive covenants  software licenses and developed technology based on the direct or indirect contribution to future cash flows on a discounted cash flow basis expected from these intangible assets over their respective useful lives 
we assess whether any relevant factors limit the period over which acquired assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows for amortization purposes and determine an appropriate useful life for acquired customer relationships based on the expected period of time we will provide services to the payer 
while we use discounted cash flows to value intangible assets  we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization to determine amortization expense 
if applicable  we assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets based on undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the review indicates that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of any long lived asset is recognized as an impairment loss 
based on the results of our impairment tests completed as of september  interim and december  annual  we recorded a total asset impairment charge related to other intangible assets for the year ended december  of million  which is included in asset impairment charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
this non cash impairment charge includes the million recorded with respect to our net services operating segment as of september  and the million recorded with respect to our social services operating segment as of december  accrued transportation costs transportation costs are estimated and accrued in the month the services are rendered by outsourced providers utilizing gross reservations for transportation services less cancellations  and average costs per transportation service by customer contract 
average costs per contract are derived by utilizing historical cost trends 
actual costs relating to a specific accounting period are monitored and compared to estimated accruals 
adjustments to those accruals are made based on reconciliations with actual costs incurred 
accounting for management agreement relationships due to the nature of our business and the requirement or desire by certain payers to contract with not for profit social services organizations  we sometimes enter into management contracts with not for profit social services organizations where we provide them with administrative  program and other management services 
these not for profit organizations contract directly with state and local agencies to supply a variety of community based mental health and foster care services to children and adults 
each of these organizations is separately incorporated and organized with its own independent board of directors 

table of contents our management agreements with these not for profit organizations typically require us to provide management  accounting  advisory  supportive  consultative and administrative services  require us to provide the necessary resources to effectively manage the business and services provided  require that we hire  supervise and terminate personnel  review existing personnel policies and assist in adopting and implementing progressive personnel policies  and compensate us with a management fee in exchange for the services provided 
all of our management services are subject to the approval or direction of the managed entities board of directors 
we have concluded that our management agreements do not meet the provisions of asc topic  consolidation  or asc  thus the operations of these organizations are not consolidated with our operations 
we will evaluate the impact of the provisions of asc  if any  on future acquired management agreements 
loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs under reinsurance programs through our wholly owned subsidiary social services providers captive insurance company  or spcic 
spcic is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of arizona 
spcic maintains reserves for obligations related to our reinsurance programs for our general and professional liability and workers compensation coverage 
as of december  and  spcic had reserves of approximately million and million  respectively  for the general and professional liability and workers compensation programs 
in addition  provado insurance services  inc  or provado  a wholly owned subsidiary of charter lci corporation which  including its subsidiaries  was acquired by us in december and is referred to as logisticare  is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of south carolina 
provado provides reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to various members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties within our net services operating segment 
provado maintains reserves for obligations related to the reinsurance programs for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage 
as of december  and  provado had reserves of approximately million and million  respectively 
these reserves are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as reinsurance liability reserves 
we utilize analyses prepared by third party administrators and independent actuaries based on historical claims information with respect to the general and professional liability coverage  workers compensation coverage  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage to determine the amount of required reserves 
we also maintain a self funded health insurance program provided to our employees 
with respect to this program  we consider historical and projected medical utilization data when estimating our health insurance program liability and related expense as well as using services of a third party administrator 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserve for our self funded health insurance programs 
we continually analyze our reserves for incurred but not reported claims  and for reported but not paid claims related to our reinsurance and self funded insurance programs 
we believe our reserves are adequate 
however  
table of contents significant judgment is involved in assessing these reserves such as assessing historical paid claims  average lags between the claims incurred date  reported dates and paid dates  and the frequency and severity of claims 
we are at risk for differences between actual settlement amounts and recorded reserves and any resulting adjustments are included in expense once a probable amount is known 
there were no significant adjustments recorded in the periods covered by this report 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these programs above our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic compensation stock compensation  or asc  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments at fair value 
with respect to stock option awards  the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and amortized over the option s vesting periods 
the black scholes merton option pricing formula requires us to make assumptions for the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  life of options and risk free interest rate 
we adopted the requirements of asc using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of asc for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of asc that remain unvested on the effective date 
we follow the short cut method prescribed by asc to calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of asc  or apic pool 
there was no effect on our financial results for or related to the application of the short cut method to determine our apic pool balance 
under asc  the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the estimated tax benefit of compensation costs recognized in the statement of operations for those options are classified as financing cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the amount of net excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options was approximately  and  net of approximately  in tax shortfalls resulting from the exercise of stock options  respectively 
for the year ended december   we had a net tax shortfall resulting from the exercise of stock options of approximately million net of approximately  in excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options 
the gross excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options are reflected as cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december   and in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our long term incentive plan  as amended  or plan  allows us the flexibility to issue up to  shares of our common stock pursuant to awards of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  unrestricted stock  stock units including restricted stock units and performance awards to employees  directors  consultants  advisors and others who are in a position to make contributions to our success and to encourage such persons to take into account our long term interests and the interests of our stockholders through ownership of our common stock or securities with value tied to our common stock 
foreign currency translation the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiary are measured using the foreign subsidiary s local currency as the functional currency 
revenues and expenses of this subsidiary are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation gain and loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders equity  unless there is a sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign investment 
presently  it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary in foreign operations 
therefore  we are not providing for us or additional foreign withholding taxes on our foreign subsidiary s undistributed earnings 
generally  such earnings become subject to us tax upon the remittance of dividends and under other circumstances 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability on such undistributed earnings due to the complexities of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or irc  rules and regulations and the hypothetical nature of the calculations 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities we hold a derivative financial instrument for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk 
the type of risk hedged relates to the variability of future earnings and cash flows caused by movements in interest rates applied to our floating rate long term debt 
we documented our risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge and will continue to assess its effectiveness during the term of the hedge 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge under asc topic derivatives and hedging  or asc derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are reported at fair value 
we measure hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
the gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge ie change in fair value is reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the remaining gain or loss of the ineffective portion of the hedge  if any  is recognized in earnings 
the fair value of the cash flow hedging instrument was a liability of approximately million and  as of december  and  respectively  which was classified as current portion of interest rate swap and other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet with respect to the balance at december   and as current portion of interest rate swap in our consolidated balance sheet at december  income taxes deferred income taxes are determined by the liability method in accordance with asc topic income taxes  or asc under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance which includes amounts for state and federal net operating loss carryforwards for which we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in the ordinary course of operations 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense 
results of operations segment reporting 
our operations are organized and reviewed by our chief operating decision maker along our service lines in two reportable segments ie  social services and net services 
we operate these reportable segments as separate divisions and differentiate the segments based on the nature of the services they offer 
the following describes each of our segments 
social services social services includes government sponsored social services consisting of home and community based counseling  foster care and not for profit management services 
our operating entities within social services provide services to a common customer group  principally individuals and families 
all of our operating entities within social services follow similar operating procedures and methods in managing their operations and each operating entity works within a similar regulatory environment  primarily under medicaid regulations 
we manage our operating activities within social services by actual to budget comparisons within each operating entity rather than by comparison between entities 
our actual operating contribution margins by operating entity within social services ranged from approximately to as of december  we believe that the long term operating contribution margins of our operating entities that comprise social services will approximate between and as the respective entities markets mature  we cross sell our services within markets  and standardize our operating model among entities including recent acquisitions 
we also believe that our targeted contribution margin of approximately is allowable by our state and local governmental payers over the long term 

table of contents our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial and non financial information for each individual entity within social services 
while financial performance in comparison to budget is evaluated on an entity by entity basis  our operating entities comprising social services are aggregated into one reporting segment for financial reporting purposes because we believe that the operating entities exhibit similar long term financial performance 
in addition  our revenues  costs and contribution margins are not significantly affected by allocating more or less resources to individual operating entities within social services because the economic characteristics of our business are substantially dependent upon individualized market demographics which affect the amount and type of services in demand as well as our cost structure primarily payroll and related costs and contract rates with payers 
in conjunction with the financial performance trends  we believe the similar qualitative characteristics of the operating entities we aggregate within social services and budgetary constraints of our payers in each market provide a foundation to conclude that the entities that we aggregate within social services have similar economic characteristics 
thus  we believe the economic characteristics of our operating entities within social services meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reporting segment under asc topic segment reporting 
net services net services includes managing the delivery of non emergency transportation services 
we operate net services as a separate division with operational management and service offerings distinct from our social services operating segment 
financial and operating performance reporting is conducted at a contract level and reviewed weekly at both the operating entity level as well as the corporate level by our chief operating decision maker 
gross margin performance of individual contracts is consolidated under the associated operating entity and direct general and administrative expenses are allocated to the operating entity 
the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated total revenues represented by items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented year ended december  revenues home and community based services foster care services management fees non emergency transportation services total revenues operating expenses client service expense cost of non emergency transportation services general and administrative expense asset impairment charge depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss non operating expense interest expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss

for  utilization of our education and other school based programs increased significantly compared to the utilization levels in in addition  we saw our payer environment begin to stabilize in our social services markets in supported by the favorable reaction to the passage of the children s health insurance program reauthorization act signed into law in february  the american recovery and reinvestment act of  and a federal court decision that permanently enjoined the state of california from making medicaid rate reductions 
with respect to our net services operating segment  membership increases related to new and existing contracts and negotiated rate increases throughout a number of contracts due to increased utilization  program enhancements and future projected program costs resulted in increased revenue for as compared to this coupled with lower utilization rates and membership increases under existing contracts and or new contracts  continued and enhanced gate keeping review process  as well as new favorable fiscal year negotiated rates for both state and hmo lines of businesses resulted in improved operating margin for in addition  our ability to gain operating efficiencies by leveraging existing infrastructure and back office support to provide services under new contracts has also contributed to increased operating margin for other items that significantly impacted our results of operations included a non recurring tax benefit resulting from the true up of our income tax provision with the actual federal and state tax returns filed in  savings due to reduced stock compensation and additional expenses associated with our amended credit agreement and proxy contest

membership increases under existing contracts and negotiated rate increases throughout a number of contracts due to increased utilization  program enhancements and future projected program costs also contributed additional revenue 
a significant portion of this revenue was generated under capitated contracts where we assumed the responsibility of meeting the transportation needs of a specific geographic population 
due to the fixed revenue stream and variable expense base structure of our net services operating segment  expenses related to this segment vary with seasonal fluctuations 
we expect our operating results will continuously fluctuate on a quarterly basis

for  purchased transportation costs increased due to services provided under new contracts as compared to as a percentage of net services revenue  purchased services decreased from approximately for to approximately for this decrease was attributed to lower than expected utilization relative to membership increases under existing contracts and or new contracts  and more selective outsourcing 
in addition  more favorable negotiated rates provided lower purchased services as a percent of revenue during as compared to other operating expenses 
other operating expenses of our net services operating segment as a percentage of net services revenue increased from for to for the increase was primarily due to our costs associated with back end support functions related to new contracts

asset impairment charge during  we experienced a significant and sustained decline in market capitalization due to the decrease in the market price of our common stock resulting  we believe  primarily from lower than anticipated financial results during such period caused by significant changes in the climate of our business  including the uncertainty in the state payer environment and the impact of related budgetary decisions  as well as by the sharp down turn in the united states economy generally 
we determined that these factors indicated an impairment loss related to goodwill as of september  as a result  we initiated an interim impairment analysis of the fair value of goodwill and determined that  based on this analysis  goodwill was impaired as of september  accordingly  we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge 
in addition to the goodwill impairment charge for the three months ended september   we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of customer relationships based on their estimated fair values for the same period

these items were partially offset by total tax benefits of million recognized during the three months ended september  related to the true up of our tax provision from the filing of our united states federal and state tax returns

table of contents managed entity revenue represents revenues of the not for profit social services organizations we manage 
although these revenues are not our revenues  because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and a significant portion of our management fees is based on a percentage of their revenues  we believe that the presentation of managed entity revenue provides investors with an additional measure of the size of the operations under our administration and can help them understand trends in our management fee revenue 
as a result of our acquisition of substantially all of the assets in illinois and indiana of ccc on september   we began consolidating the financial results of these operations on october   which accounts for a decrease of approximately million in managed entity revenue for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended september  revenues from our home and community based services declined approximately million as compared to the first and second quarters of due to lower client demand for our home and community based services during the summer season

additionally  there was a decrease of approximately million in operating income for our social services segment for the three months ended september  compared to the three months ended june  due to lower client demand for our home and community based services during the summer season 
the increase in revenue during the three months ended september  and december  was partially attributable to a net services contract that began in july the impact of this new contract resulted in an increase in non emergency transportation services revenue of approximately million for the three months ended september  and million for the three months ended december  seasonality our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business 
in our social services operating segment  lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday and summer seasons generally results in lower revenue during those periods  however  
table of contents our expenses related to the social services operating segment do not vary significantly with these changes 
as a result  our social services operating segment experiences lower operating margins during the holiday and summer seasons 
our net services operating segment also experiences fluctuations in demand for our non emergency transportation services during the summer  winter and holiday seasons 
due to higher demand in the summer months and lower demand in the winter and holiday seasons  coupled with a fixed revenue stream based on a per member per month based structure  our net services operating segment experiences lower operating margins in the summer season and higher operating margins in the winter and holiday seasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the seasonal demand for our home and community based services and non emergency transportation services 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive response by other social services and transportation providers 
liquidity and capital resources short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses and debt service requirements 
we expect to meet these requirements through available cash  generation of cash from our operating segments  and our revolving and term loan credit facility  as amended 
sources of cash for were primarily from operations

for the year ended december   net cash flow from operating activities totaled approximately million 
decreases in management fees receivable resulted in an increase in cash provided by operations of approximately  prepaid expenses and other assets decreased  which resulted in an increase in cash flow from operations of approximately million

we agreed with cit to subordinate our management fee receivable pursuant to management agreements established with our managed entities  which have stand alone credit facilities with cit healthcare llc  to the claims of cit in the event one of these managed entities defaults under its credit facility 
as of december   approximately  of our management fees receivable related to these managed entities was subject to this subordination agreement

on february   we entered into an interest rate swap to convert a portion of our floating rate long term debt to fixed rate debt 
the purpose of this instrument is to hedge the variability of our future earnings and cash flows caused by movements in interest rates applied to our floating rate long term debt 
we hold this derivative only for the purpose of hedging such risks  not for speculation 
we entered into the interest rate swap with a notional amount of million maturing on february  under the swap agreement  we receive interest equivalent to three month libor and pay a fixed rate of interest of with settlement occurring quarterly 
upon the expiration of the interest rate swap discussed above  we entered into a new interest rate swap effective march   with a notional amount of million maturing on december  under this new swap agreement  we receive interest equivalent to one month libor and pay a fixed rate of interest of 
with settlement occurring monthly 
by entering into the interest rate swap  we effectively fixed the interest rate payable by us on million of our floating rate long term debt at for the period march  to december  promissory notes

contingent obligations 
on august   our board of directors adopted the providence service corporation deferred compensation plan  or the deferred compensation plan  for our eligible employees and independent contractors or a participating employer as defined in the deferred compensation plan 
under the deferred compensation plan participants may defer all or a portion of their base salary  service bonus  performance based compensation earned in a period of months or more  commissions and  in the case of independent contractors  compensation reportable on form the deferred compensation plan is unfunded and benefits are paid from our general assets 
as of december   there were seven participants in the deferred compensation plan 
we also maintain a a deferred compensation rabbi trust plan for highly compensated employees of our net services operating segment 
benefits are paid from our general assets under this plan 
as of december   highly compensated employees participated in this plan 
we may be obligated to pay an amount up to  to the sellers under an earn out provision pursuant to a formula specified in an asset purchase agreement effective july  by which we acquired certain assets of an entity located in california 
the earn out payment as such term is defined in the asset purchase agreement  if earned  will be paid in cash 
the earn out period ends on december  if the contingency is resolved in accordance with the related provisions of the asset purchase agreement and the additional consideration becomes distributable  we will record the fair value of the consideration issued as an additional cost to acquire the associated assets  which will be charged to earnings 
management agreements we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations that require us to provide management and administrative services for each organization 
in exchange for these services  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
the not for profit social services organizations managed by us that qualify under section c of the internal revenue code  referred to as a c entity  each maintain a board of directors  a majority of which are independent 
all economic decisions by the board of any c entity that affect us are made solely by the independent board members 
our management agreements with each c entity are typically subject to third party fairness opinions from an independent appraiser retained by the independent board members of the tax exempt organizations 
management fees generated under our management agreements represented and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in accordance with our management agreements with these not for profit organizations  we have obligations to manage their business and services 
management fee receivable at december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and management fee revenue was recognized on all of these receivables 
in order to enhance liquidity of the entities we manage  we may allow the managed entities to defer payment of their respective management fees 
in addition  since government contractors who provide social or similar services to government beneficiaries sometimes experience collection delays due to either lack of proper documentation of claims  government budgetary processes or similar reasons outside the contractors control either directly or as managers of other contracting entities  we generally do not consider a management fee receivable to be uncollectible due solely to its age until it is days old 

table of contents the following is a summary of the aging of our management fee receivable balances as of december  and march  june  september and december  at less than days days days days over days december  march  june  september  december  each month we evaluate the solvency  outlook and ability to pay outstanding management fees of the entities we manage 
if the likelihood that we will not be paid is other than remote  we defer the recognition of these management fees until we are certain that payment is probable 
we have deemed payment of all of the management fee receivables to be probable based on our collection history with these entities as the long term manager of their operations 
our days sales outstanding for our managed entities increased from days at december  to days at december  reinsurance and self funded insurance programs reinsurance we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs under reinsurance programs through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  spcic 
we also provide reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to certain members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties under our net services segment through provado 
provado  a wholly owned subsidiary of logisticare  is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of south carolina 
the decision to reinsure our risks and provide a self funded health insurance program to our employees was made based on current conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of self insurance retentions  increasing number of coverage limitations  and fluctuating insurance premium rates 
spcic spcic  which is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of arizona  reinsures third party insurers for general and professional liability exposures for the first dollar of each and every loss up to million per loss and million in the aggregate 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception in of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately million 
the excess premium over our expected losses may be used to fund spcic s operating expenses  fund any deficit arising in workers compensation liability coverage  provide for surplus reserves  and to fund any other risk management activities 
spcic reinsures a third party insurer for worker s compensation insurance for the first dollar of each and every loss up to  per occurrence with no annual aggregate limit 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception in of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately million 
based on an independent actuarial report  our expected losses related to workers compensation and general and professional liability in excess of our liability under our associated reinsurance programs at december  was approximately million 
we recorded a corresponding asset and liability at december  for these expected losses  which would be paid by third party insurers to the extent losses are incurred 
we have an umbrella liability insurance policy providing additional coverage in the amount of million in the aggregate in excess of the policy limits of the general and professional liability insurance policy and automobile liability insurance policy 

table of contents spcic had restricted cash of approximately million at december  and million at december   which was restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses of spcic under the general and professional liability and workers compensation reinsurance programs 
the full extent of claims may not be fully determined for years 
therefore  the estimates of potential obligations are based on recommendations of an independent actuary using historical data  industry data  and our claims experience 
although we believe that the amounts accrued for losses incurred but not reported under the terms of our reinsurance programs are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with these claims made under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
provado under a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurer  provado reinsures the third party insurer for the first  of each loss for each line of coverage  subject to an annual aggregate equal to of gross written premium  and certain claims in excess of  to an additional aggregate limit of million 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately million 
the liabilities for expected losses and loss adjustment expenses are based primarily on individual case estimates for losses reported by claimants 
an estimate is provided for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported on the basis of our claim experience and claim experience of the industry 
these estimates are reviewed at least annually by independent consulting actuaries 
as experience develops and new information becomes known  the estimates are adjusted

health insurance we offer our employees an option to participate in a self funded health insurance program 
with respect to our social services operating segment  health claims were self funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability for individual claims to  per person and for a maximum potential claim liability based on member enrollment 
with respect to our net services operating segment  we offer self funded health insurance to our employees 
health claims under this program are self funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability to  per incident and a maximum potential claim liability based on member enrollment 
the aggregate maximum potential claim liability is approximately million for our social services and net services operating segments 

table of contents health insurance claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
we maintain accruals for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plan administrator and therefore have not been paid 
the incurred but not reported reserve is based on an established cap and current payment trends of health insurance claims 
the liability for the self funded health plan of approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively  was recorded in reinsurance liability reserve in our consolidated balance sheets 
we charge our employees a portion of the costs of our self funded group health insurance programs 
we determine this charge at the beginning of each plan year based upon historical and projected medical utilization data 
any difference between our projections and our actual experience is borne by us 
we estimate potential obligations for liabilities under this program to reserve what we believe to be a sufficient amount to cover liabilities based on our past experience 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under this program above what we reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
contractual cash obligations 
the following is a summary of our future contractual cash obligations as of december  at december  contractual cash obligations s total less than year years years after years debt interest purchased services commitments capital leases operating leases total future interest payments have been calculated at rates that existed as of december  stock repurchase program on february   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to one million shares of our common stock 
since inception  we have spent approximately million to purchase  shares of our common stock on the open market 
we did not purchase shares of our common stock during and during the term of the credit agreement we are prohibited from purchasing shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
liquidity matters we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and amended credit agreement provide funds necessary to meet our operating plan for the expected operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses as well as interest and projected principal payments on our debt 
in addition  we are focusing on several strategic options to reduce our debt 
we may access capital markets to raise equity financing for various business reasons  including required debt payments and acquisitions 
the timing  term  size  and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing 
in addition  with respect to required debt payments  the amended credit agreement with cit requires that upon receipt of any proceeds from a disposition  involuntary disposition  equity issuance  or debt issuance as defined in the amended credit agreement we must prepay principal then outstanding in an aggregate amount equal to at least of such proceeds except where the disposition requires the consent of the lenders  in which case the net cash proceeds will be used to prepay outstanding principal 

table of contents on october   our board of directors authorized a total voluntary prepayment on the term loan of million 
the decision by our board of directors to authorize this prepayment was based on the substantial free cash generated by our operating activities in the first half of the prepayment was made in two installments  the first of which  in the amount of million  was made on october  and the second installment in the amount of million was made on november  our operating performance for and the million prepayment noted above improved the company s financial covenant ratios for the million voluntary prepayment  in addition to regularly scheduled principal payments in the aggregate amount of million in  reduced the balance of our term loan to approximately million at december  our total long term debt obligations at december  were approximately million

the amended requirements of asc are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is prohibited 
on january   we adopted the amended requirements of asc noted above 
the adoption of these requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb amended the guidance in asc regarding evaluating whether an instrument involving a contingency is considered indexed to an entity s own stock 
the amended guidance in asc is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is not permitted 
paragraph a of asc specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both a indexed to the company s own stock and b classified in stockholders equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument 
the amended guidance in asc provides a new two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock and thus able to qualify for the scope exception provided for in paragraph asc a 
our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes are subject to the amended guidance in asc since the notes are indexed to our own stock and are convertible  under certain circumstances  into common stock at a specified conversion rate 
based on our analysis of the notes under asc and other related guidance  we concluded that the embedded conversion option qualifies for the scope exception in paragraph asc a because it is both indexed to our own stock because all of the triggering conversion events are contingencies that are not based on an observable market or an observable index and that the only variables that affect the settlement amount 
table of contents of the conversion in each case would be inputs to the fair value of a fixed for fixed option on equity shares as they relate to stock price and would be classified in stockholders equity if it were a freestanding instrument 
the notes including the embedded conversion option are classified as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
asc requires issuers of convertible notes that protect holders from declines in the issuer s stock price down round protection to account for these instruments as derivatives 
the notes do not contain any down round protection  therefore the adoption of the amended guidance in asc as of january  did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in april  fasb amended the provisions of asc related to the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations 
no subsequent accounting guidance is provided in the amended guidance  and the fasb expects an acquirer to develop a systematic and rational basis for subsequently measuring and accounting for acquired contingencies depending on their nature 
the amended provisions of asc noted above are effective for contingent assets or contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we have determined that the adoption of the amended provisions of asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on april   fasb provided additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with asc when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
in addition  this supplemental guidance includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
further  the supplemental guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation technique s used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
the supplemental guidance in asc described above is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   and is to be applied prospectively 
early adoption is permitted 
we adopted the supplemental guidance in asc beginning with the quarterly period ended june  and determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on april   fasb amended asc topic financial instruments  or asc  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements 
this guidance also amends asc topic interim reporting to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
the amended requirements of asc described above are effective for interim reporting periods ending after june  we adopted the amended requirements of asc beginning with the quarterly period ended june  and determined that  other than the additional disclosures related to the fair value of financial instruments we are now required to make  the adoption of the amended requirements of asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
asc subsequent events  or asc  establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
specifically  asc sets forth the period and circumstances during and under which an entity should evaluate events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date for potential recognition and disclosure in the financial statements 
asc also provides guidance regarding the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
we adopted the provisions of asc beginning with the quarterly period ended june  in accordance with asc s effective date and we conducted an evaluation of the effects of subsequent events through the date on which our reports on forms q and k are filed 
the adoption of asc impacts only disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  subesequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  or asu the amendments in asu remove the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have 
table of contents been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of gaap 
the fasb also clarified that if the financial statements have been revised  then an entity that is not an sec filer should disclose both the date that the financial statements were issued or available to be issued and the date the revised financial statements were issued or available to be issued 
the fasb believes these amendments remove potential conflicts with the sec s literature 
all of the amendments in asu were effective upon issuance except for the use of the issued date for conduit debt obligors 
that amendment is effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  we adopted the provisions of asu upon issuance 
the adoption only impacted disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  generally accepted accounting principles  or asu fasb issued asu asc topic to establish the asc as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by non governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and to identify the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap 
asu does not affect the rules and interpretive releases of the sec  which are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
asu is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the provisions of asu beginning with the quarterly period ended september  and determined that the adoption of asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements because it only codifies existing non sec accounting literature 
in august  the fasb issued asu measuring liabilities at fair value  or asu  an amendment of asc asu addresses practice difficulties caused by the tension between fair value measurements based on the price that would be paid to transfer a liability to a new obligor and contractual or legal requirements that prevent such transfers from taking place 
asu provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using valuation techniques that incorporate the quoted price of the identical liability when the liability is traded as an asset  quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when the liabilities are traded as assets  or other valuation techniques that are consistent with the principles of asc eg a present value technique based on the income approach 
the guidance provided in asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after august  we adopted the provisions of asu beginning with the quarterly period ended september  and determined that the adoption of asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting pronouncements in october   the fasb issued asu no 
revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  or asu asu amends asc subtopic to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  or third party evidence  or tpe  before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
application of the residual method of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted upon adoption of asu additionally  the new guidance will require entities to disclose more information about their multiple element revenue arrangements 
the asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
if a company elects early adoption and the period of adoption is not the beginning of its fiscal year  the requirements must be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year 
retrospective application to prior years is an option  but is not required 
in the initial year of application  companies 
table of contents are required to make qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the impact of the changes 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  or asu asu amends the guidance on variable interest entities in asc topic related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
it requires reporting entities to evaluate former qualifying special purpose entities  or qspes  for consolidation  changes the approach to determining a variable interest entities  or vies  primary beneficiary from a quantitative assessment to a qualitative assessment designed to identify a controlling financial interest  and increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
it also clarifies  but does not significantly change  the characteristics that identify a vie 
this asu requires additional year end and interim disclosures for public and nonpublic companies that are similar to the disclosures required by asc paragraphs through and through asu no 
is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting period thereafter 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements  or asu asu amends certain disclosure requirements of subtopic and provides additional disclosures for transfers in and out of levels i and ii and for activity in level iii 
this asu also clarifies certain other existing disclosure requirements including level of desegregation and disclosures around inputs and valuation techniques 
the final amendments to the asc will be effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activity for purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis 
that requirement will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is permitted 
asu does not require disclosures for earlier periods presented for comparative purposes at initial adoption 
we believe that asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
technical corrections to various topics  or asu asu is the result of the fasb s review of its standards to determine if any provisions are outdated  contain inconsistencies  or need clarifications to reflect the fasb s original intent 
the fasb believes the amendments do not fundamentally change gaap 
however  certain clarifications on embedded derivatives and hedging subtopic may cause a change in the application of that subtopic and special transition provisions are provided for those amendments 
the asu contains various effective dates 
the clarifications of the guidance on embedded derivatives and hedging subtopic are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the amendments to the guidance on accounting for income taxes in a reorganization subtopic applies to reorganizations for which the date of the reorganization is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  all other amendments are effective as of the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after february  we do not believe that asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption
