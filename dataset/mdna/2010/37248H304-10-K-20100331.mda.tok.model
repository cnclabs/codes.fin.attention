we do not have any intention or obligation to update forward looking statements included in this report after the date of this report  except as required by law 
overview we are an oil and gas company in the business of exploring and developing oil and natural gas reserves on a worldwide basis 
since inception  we have conducted leasehold acquisition  exploration and drilling activities on our north american  australian and indonesian prospects 
these projects currently encompass approximately  gross  net acres  consisting of mineral leases  production sharing contracts and exploration permits that give us the right to explore for  develop and produce oil and natural gas 
most of these properties are in the exploration  appraisal or development drilling phase and have not begun to produce revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas 
excluding minor interest and dividend income  our only significant cash inflows until were the recovery of capital invested in projects through sale or other divestiture of interests in oil and gas prospects to industry partners 
since  substantially all of our revenue has been generated from natural gas sales derived from the magness  the fannin  and the mitchell wells in the madisonville field in east texas under spot gas purchase contracts at market prices 
natural gas sales from the madisonville field are expected to account for substantially all of our revenues for we expect the majority of our capital expenditures in will be for the madisonville project 
for the years ended december  consolidated statement of operations revenues plant operating expense lease operating expense general and administrative net profits expense impairment expense depreciation and depletion expense loss from operations net loss net loss attributable to common shareholders revenue and operating trends in as discussed in the properties texas madisonville project section of this annual report  in order to produce the gas reserves from the rodessa formation  we developed an onsite plan to treat and remove impurities from the madisonville project natural gas in order to meet pipeline quality specifications 
in  a third party completed the construction and installation of a 
table of contents natural gas treatment plant with a designed capacity of million cubic feet of gas per day mmcf d and associated pipeline and gathering facilities 
in we secured a commitment from mgp to install and make operational additional treating facilities capable of treating mmcf d  which combined with the capacity of the current in service treating facilities will represent a total designed treating capacity of mmcf d for the madisonville treatment plant 
in early november  mgp began testing the additional treatment facilities by accepting mmcf d at the inlet 
subsequently in december  mgp suspended the operations of the additional treatment facilities in order to make modifications to more effectively deal with the presence of diamondoids in the gas stream produced from the rodessa formation 
during  mgp analyzed various options for removing the diamondoids  however  they did not complete the necessary plant system modifications 
on december   we purchased the gas treatment plant and related gathering pipeline from mgp in exchange for assumption of secured debt  payment of certain outstanding payables of mgp and shares of geopetro s common stock 
the effective date of the acquisition was december  and the new owner of the plant is geopetro s wholly owned  indirect subsidiary  madisonville midstream llc mm 
we expect to complete installation of the system modifications required in the new plant in in the meantime  the existing  in service portion of the plant continues to operate with a design capacity of up to approximately mmcf d of inlet gas 
while there can be no assurance  with acquisition of the gas treatment plant  our goal is to make the necessary upgrades to the plant and increase the production rates from our wells which may result in higher net production and increased revenue during as compared to and prior periods 
to accomplish the plant upgrades  we will need to raise capital in due to the unsettled state of the capital markets  funds may not be available  or may not be available on favorable terms 
prior to december   the price received for natural gas was determined pursuant to certain agreements which were in effect with mgp 
pursuant to these agreements  mgp purchased the company s untreated natural gas in the madisonville field for each of the producing wells and charged the company a fixed fee to gather  treat  transport and market its natural gas  provided however  that such fees would not exceed the value of the natural gas 
hydrogen sulphide  carbon dioxide and nitrogen combined comprise about of the gas content 
the untreated natural gas is delivered to the gas treatment plant where substantially all the natural gas impurities are removed before delivery to the sales pipeline 
as a result of the costs to gather  treat  transport and market the natural gas  we received a net price that is substantially lower than we would otherwise receive if the gas did not contain the of impurities 
due to weak natural gas prices prevailing for most of  the costs to gather  treat  transport and market the natural gas exceeded the value of the natural gas produced during most of the year 
industry overview for the year ended december  during we experienced significantly deteriorating natural gas prices throughout of the year  with a rebound in prices by the end of the year 
the houston ship channel price  the index price prevailing in the locale of our madisonville project in madison county  texas  as quoted in gas daily as of december  was per mcf versus per mcf as of december  natural gas prices were volatile during due to over supply and recessionary concerns earlier in the year and later in the year due to seasonal weather driven demand spurred by unusually cold winter temperatures in many parts of the us 
company overview in our net loss after taxes for the year ended december  was  from our inception  through mid  we only received nominal revenues from our oil and natural gas activities  while incurring substantial acquisition and exploration costs and overhead expenses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit through december  of  commencing in may  we placed our madisonville project into production 
substantially all of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from our madisonville project  from three producing wells  the umc ruby magness well the magness well  the angela farris fannin well the fannin well  and the mitchell well the mitchell well 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  and during the twelve months ended december   we had gross natural gas revenues from the treatment plant of  and revenues from treating third party gas in the plant of  during this period  our gross production from our wells was  mcf production net of royalties of  mcf and our average natural gas price realized was per 
table of contents mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  and our net production was  mcf of natural gas at an average price of per mcf 
revenues decreased in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the prior year period due to lower production volumes and lower natural gas prices 
the lower net production volumes for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period of was due to natural declines in the wells 
average natural gas prices were approximately lower for the twelve months ended december  versus the same period in the average natural gas price of per mcf for the period was net of treating  gathering  marketing and transportation fees collectively the fees in accordance with our contracts with mgp and gateway adac pipeline  llc 
the average natural gas price of per mcf for the period was not net of the aforementioned fees since the contracts that were in place with mgp were terminated as of december  prior to december   revenue was recognized upon delivery of oil and gas production and was shown net of applicable royalty payments  as well as processing  gathering  transportation and marketing fees 
as indicated in the preceding paragraph  the company recognized revenue from the madisonville field net of applicable fees to treat  gather  transport and market the company s natural gas production 
the applicable fees were paid to unrelated third parties 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of the plant from mgp 
commencing january   revenue is being recognized without the netting of applicable royalty payments  as well as processing  gathering  transportation and marketing fees since we have acquired the plant 
for all periods presented  revenue from the madisonville field is recognized when the price for gas delivered became fixed and determinable 
our results of operations for the twelve months ended december  include the operating results of the plant  but our results of operations for the twelve months ended december  do not include the operating results of the natural gas treatment plant because such acquisition closed on december  the following condensed pro forma information gives effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred on january  the pro forma information has been included in the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this document as required by generally accepted accounting principles and is provided for comparison purposes only 
the pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the financial results that would have occurred had the acquisition been effective on the dates indicated and should not be viewed as indicative of operations in the future 
twelve months ended december  operating revenues total operating expenses loss applicable to common stock net loss per share during the twelve months ended december   we incurred plant operating expenses of  our average plant operating cost for the period was per mcf on net throughput of  mcf 
we purchased the gas treatment plant effective on december   thus there was no plant operating expense for the comparable period 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
the average lifting cost per mcf in was lower due to cost cutting efforts and a reduction of ad valorem property taxes applicable to the wells 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred no net profits interest expense because we did not generate a net operating profit from our magness  fannin  and mitchell wells 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred net profits interest expense of  associated with the magness  the fannin  and the mitchell wells 
the net profit interest is of the net operating profit from our magness  fannin  and mitchell wells 
general and administrative g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this represents a  or increase over the prior year period 
the higher g a expense incurred in was due primarily to new options issued during and for the year ended december   impairment expense was  versus  for the same period of the impairment write downs were due to i dry holes drilled on our canadian oil and gas properties  and ii writeoff remaining costs related to the south bengara due to project cancellation iii million impairment in the madisonville project in us  which resulted in ceiling test write downs 

table of contents for year end  new sec rules were implemented requiring that reserve calculations be based on the un weighted average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months  as contrasted with the previous method which utilized period end prices 
the prices under the new rules were per mcf for natural gas adjusted for energy content  quality and basis differentials 
under the new rules  this resulted in a ceiling test write down of  associated with the us full cost pool 
had we used the price prevailing on december  of per mcf for natural gas  there would have been no year end write down 
under full cost accounting  a ceiling test is performed to ensure that unamortized capitalized costs in each cost center country do not exceed their fair value 
impairment is recognized when the carrying value is greater than the discounted future cash flows 
in the event of impairment  the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the long lived asset is charged to earnings 
the present value of estimated future net revenues is computed by applying current oil and gas prices to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions 
depreciation and depletion expense for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  in the same period of  which amounts primarily represent depletion of the oil and gas properties for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to gas processing plant depreciation in which offset decreased depletion expense resulting from lower net production in the twelve months period of as previously discussed 
loss from operations totaled  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to loss from operations of  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in the loss from operations was due primarily to higher impairment  depreciation and depletion expenses 
other income for the twelve months ended december  and consisted of interest income in the amount of  and  respectively  resulting from lower average cash balances due to our purchase of the plant on december  during the twelve months ended december  and  we incurred interest expense of  and  respectively 
we incurred new debt in late december and subsequently during associated with the plant acquisition and working capital requirements 
net loss before taxes for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in net loss during the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to lower gas prices  lower production volume  higher operating expenses  ceiling test write off in the us pool due to new sec requirment 
income tax benefit for the twelve months ended december  was compared to income tax expense of  in the same period of the increased income tax benefit was due to refund from texas franchise tax overpayment 

table of contents recent developments during the twelve months ended december  we borrowed  pursuant to five separate three year loans which were convertible into a newly designated class of preferred stock of geopetro  series b convertible preferred stock the series b preferred stock and  pursuant to eleven separate loans 
the  in loans converted into series b preferred stock on april   along with an additional  which was advanced during april for a total subscription in the private placement of  shares for a purchase price of per share and an aggregate investment of  the holders of series b stock are entitled to receive an annual dividend at the rate of per share and are entitled to such number of votes per share as equals the number of common shares into which each share of series b stock is convertible 
each share of series b stock is convertible  at the option of the holder  into fully paid and non assessable common shares on a one for one basis  subject to certain adjustments 
the series b stock will automatically convert into common shares on a one for one share basis effective the first trading day after the reported high selling price for the company s common shares on any international  national or regional securities exchange or inter dealer quotation system including but not limited to  nasdaq  the pink sheets or the over the counter bulletin board  is at least per share for any ten consecutive trading days 
if an automatic conversion occurs within one year after the series b stock was purchased from the company  a holder will receive  on the one year anniversary date of his  her or its purchase  a cash dividend equivalent to a full year of dividends less any dividends paid before such conversion

we have previously accrued all amounts owed pursuant to these overriding royalty interests as royalty owners payable 
in the opinion of management based on consultation with legal counsel  these proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents on february   we entered into a new lease for our principal executive office to be located at california street  suite  san francisco  ca the terms of the lease provide for an eighty four month term 
minimum annual rentals due under this agreement are as follows total the lease provides that rent for the first five months of the lease term totaling  shall be abated provided we are not in default during the term of the lease

liquidity and capital resources our cash balance at december  was  compared to a cash balance of  at december  the change in our cash balance is summarized as follows cash balance at december  sources of cash cash provided by disposition of equipment cash provided by financing activities total sources of cash including cash on hand uses of cash cash used by operating actives cash used in investing activities oil and natural gas property expenditures gas processing plant total uses of cash cash balance at december  we had a working capital deficit of  and  at december  and december   respectively 
our working capital increased during year ended december  due primarily to funds raised from private placement from series b preferred stock 

table of contents we have historically financed our business activities through december  principally through issuances of preferred stocks  issuances of common shares  promissory notes  common share purchase warrants in private placements and an initial public offering 
these financings are summarized as follows years ended december  december  proceeds from sale of common shares and warrant exercises  net proceeds from sale of preferred series b  net payment on preferred dividends repayments of promissory notes proceeds from promissory notes payment of loan fee repayment of related party note net option exercise net cash provided by financing activities the net proceeds of our equity and note financings have been primarily invested in oil and natural gas properties totaling  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on december   we acquired the gas treatment plant from mgp for  in combination of cash  debt and common stock 
the company assumed  of madisonville gas processing lp s mgp bank debt related to the company s acquisition of the madisonville gas treatment plant the plant via a i million cash payment applied directly towards debt principal reduction  and ii a refinancing by geopetro of the  remaining balance in the form of a year amended and restated term loan agreement with the lender  bank oklahoma bok 
the terms of the three year loan provide for minimum quarterly principal payments of  and interest payable quarterly in arrears at prime plus or  libor plus  at the option of the company 
additional principal will be payable upon geopetro meeting certain net operating cash flow thresholds during the three year term of the loan 
the loan is secured by a first lien on the madisonville midstream plant and all of the company s proved natural gas reserves located at the madisonville project 
in addition  geopetro has agreed to a pay  at the time the loan is repaid in full  a loan origination fee of i  for any period during the three year term during which the loan principal remains outstanding 
there is no prepayment penalty 
the amended and restated term loan agreement  as further amended  contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on incurring additional debt and requiring that the company maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least on december   we issued million shares of common stock pursuant to an asset purchase agreement related to the acquisition of the madisonville midstream gas treatment plant and related gas gathering pipelines and related facilities from madisonville gas processing  lp 
during december  geopetro raised  by issuing promissory notes to accredited investors  each having the following terms i annual simple interest payable quarterly in arrears  ii principal and any unpaid outstanding interest shall be payable at the end of three years  iii subordinated to the bok loan and iv be unsecured 
each note purchaser also received warrants to purchase one share of geopetro common stock for per share  exercisable for three years 
one warrant was received for each in face amount of notes purchased a total of  warrants exercisable to purchase  shares of common stock 
geopetro also reissued  warrants at per share to be exercised for three years 
we raised  in convertible notes that were converted into our series b preferred stock on april   an additional  in our series b preferred stock  and issued  in promissory notes 
on september   we 
table of contents completed the sale of certain idle equipment from our natural gas processing plant for total cash proceeds of million 
during october  we issued a promissory note for total gross proceeds of  net proceeds of  and issued an additional  shares of series b preferred stock for total gross proceeds of our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and growth strategy requirements for the foreseeable future 
see outlook for for a description of our expected capital expenditures for if we are unable to generate revenues necessary to finance our operations over the long term  we may have to seek additional capital through the sale of our equity or borrowing 
as noted in recent developments  we periodically borrow funds pursuant to promissory notes to finance our activities 
as discussed in the outlook for  we are forecasting capital expenditures of million during we will need to obtain adequate sources of cash to fund our anticipated capital expenditures through the end of and to follow through with plans for continued investments in oil and gas properties 
our success  in part  depends on our ability to generate additional financing and farmout certain of our projects 
additionally  as a result of the economic downturn  the company may have difficulty raising sufficient funds to meet our projected funding requirements 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business 
since our inception  we have participated as a working interest owner in the acquisition of undeveloped leases  seismic options  lease options and foreign concessions and have participated in seismic surveys and the drilling of test wells on our undeveloped properties 
further leasehold acquisitions  drilling and seismic operations are planned for and future periods 
in addition  exploratory and development drilling is scheduled during and future periods on our undeveloped properties 
it is anticipated that these exploration activities together with others that may be entered into will impose financial requirements which will exceed our existing working capital 
we may raise additional equity and or debt capital  and we may farm out certain of our projects to finance our continued participation in planned activities 
however  if additional financing is not available  we may be compelled to reduce the scope of our business activities 
if we are unable to fund planned expenditures  it may be necessary to farmout our interest in proposed wells  sell a portion of our interest in prospects and use the sale proceeds to fund our participation for a lesser interest  reduce general and administrative expenses  forfeit our interest in wells that are proposed to be drilled 
outlook for capital depending on capital availability  we are forecasting capital spending of up to approximately  during the year  allocated as follows madisonville project  madison county  texas approximately  may be expended in the madisonville field area as follows  million for capital maintenance and repair on new gas treatment plant   toward the fracture stimulation and hook up costs of the wilson well  and  for the mitchell well workover 
california approximately  to be utilized for land and permitting costs 
we may  in our discretion  decide to allocate resources towards other projects in addition to or in lieu of  those listed above should other opportunities arise and as circumstances warrant 
we currently do not have sufficient working capital to fund all of the capital expenditures listed above 
we may  in our discretion  fund the foregoing planned expenditures from operating cash flows  asset sales  potential debt and equity issuances and or a combination of all four 
the madisonville project forecasted capital expenditures will play an important part in the company achieving our cash flow projections 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we expect commodity prices to be volatile  reflecting the current supply and demand fundamentals for north american natural gas and world crude oil 
political and economic events around the world  which are difficult to predict  will continue to influence both oil and gas prices 
significant price changes for oil and gas often lead to changes in the levels of drilling activity which in turn lead to changes in costs to explore  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
significant change in costs could affect the returns on our capital expenditures 
higher crude prices could also help keep natural gas prices high by keeping alternative fuels  such as heating oil and residual fuel  expensive 
income taxes as of december   geopetro had net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in if the company were to experience a change in ownership under section  the company may be limited in its ability to fully utilize its net operating losses 
however  in accordance with asc formerly sfas r  a deferred tax asset has not been recognized for the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that is attributable to excess tax deductions associated with the exercise of stock options which do not reduce income taxes payable 
accordingly  approximately  of geopetro s federal nol has not been benefited for financial statement purposes as it relates to excess tax deductions that have not reduced income taxes payable 
the benefit of these excess tax deductions will not be recognized for financial statement purposes until the related deductions reduce income taxes payable 
the company also has approximately  of california net operating losses and approximately  of alaska net operating losses which begin to expire in and  respectively 
in accordance with asc  a portion of the state nols has similarly not been benefited for financial statement purposes as it relates to excess tax deductions which have not resulted in the reduction of income taxes payable 
the benefit of such excess tax deductions will not be recognized for financial statement purposes until the related deductions reduce state income taxes payable 
in addition  the company has approximately  of carryforward credits in texas  a portion of which may be utilized each year against texas margin tax liability through a significant change in our ownership may limit our ability to use these nol carryforwards 
asc  accounting for income taxes formerly statement of financial accounting standards no 
 requires that the tax benefit of such net operating loss be recorded as an asset 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately  related to the nol and 
table of contents other temporary differences 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance of  at december  due to uncertainties surrounding the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   our off balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
financial instruments we currently have no natural gas price financial instruments or hedges in place 
similarly  we have no financial derivatives 
our natural gas marketing contracts use spot market prices 
given the uncertainty of the timing and volumes of our natural gas production this year  we do not currently plan to enter into any long term fixed price natural gas contracts  swap or hedge positions  other gas financial instruments or financial derivatives in impact of inflation changing prices as the following table illustrates  average sales prices of natural gas have changed in the past three years 
this has led to changes in revenues and earnings from operations for the year ended december  average sales prices per mcf net production volume mcf revenues loss from operation includes  impairment expense includes  impairment expense 
table of contents we are highly dependent upon natural gas pricing 
a material decrease in current and projected natural gas prices could impair our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms 
likewise  a material decrease in current and projected natural gas prices could also impact our revenues and cash flows 
this could impact our ability to fund future activities 
changing prices have had a significant impact on costs of drilling and completing wells  particularly in the madisonville field area where we are currently the most active 
the estimated cost of drilling and completing a rodessa formation well at approximately  feet of depth has increased from million in to million in due to higher costs associated with tubular goods  well equipment  and day rates for drilling contracts  among other factors 
these higher costs have impacted and will continue to impact our income from operations in the form of higher depletion expense 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the most critical accounting policies that may have an impact on our financial results relate to the accounting for oil and gas properties 
amortization  abandonment costs and full cost ceiling limitation write downs are all based on numerous estimates  many of which are beyond management s control 
reserves valuation is central to much of the accounting for an oil and gas company as described below 
significant accounting policies are contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a summary of unaudited supplementary oil and gas reserve information is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following discusses the accounting estimates that are critical in determining the reported financial results oil and gas properties we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as prescribed by us gaap and  accordingly  capitalize all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development drilling of proved oil and gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and lease rentals 
all general corporate costs are expensed as incurred 
in general  sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded 
amortization of proved oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on all proved reserves on a country by country basis 
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregate basis 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties full cost ceiling limitation are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  net of tax considerations 
reserves we engage independent petroleum engineering consultants to evaluate our reserves 
reserves  future production profiles  and net revenues are estimated by independent professional reservoir engineering firms 
while we engage qualified reservoir engineering firms  their estimates are inherently uncertain  involve numerous assumptions that may not be realized  and predict asset values that may not be indicative of the true market value of the assets evaluated 
as a result of the inherent uncertainties and changing technical and economic assumptions  reserve estimates are subject to revisions that can materially impact our results 
stock based compensation the company has a stock based compensation plan that allows employees to purchase common shares of the company 
option exercise prices approximate the market price for the common shares on the date the options were issued 
options granted under the plan are generally fully exercisable within five years and expire five to ten years after the grant date 
we measure and record stock based awards to directors  employees and consultants based on the grant date fair value  determined using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions for risk free interest rates  expected dividend yield  expected life of the option  and the expected volatility 
we record the compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period defined in the award 
the company recorded  and  of stock based employee compensation for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
recently issued accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted asc formerly staff position no 
eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  which provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities  and  therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method 
we adopted the provisions of this standard on january   with no significant impact on our financial statements 
effective january   we adopted asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement  which amends and expands the disclosure requirements with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  ii how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for  and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
we adopted the provisions of this standard on january   with no significant impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting standards codificationtm and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the fasb accounting standards codificationtm the codification has become the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
all existing accounting standard documents are superseded by the codification and any accounting literature not included in the codification will not be authoritative 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec issued under the authority of federal securities laws  however  will continue to be the source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles for sec registrants 
effective september   all references made to gaap in our consolidated financial statements will include the new codification numbering system along with original references 
the codification does not change or alter existing gaap and  therefore  will not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the sec issued the final rule on the modernization of oil and gas reporting 
this sec ruling revises its oil and gas reserves reporting requirements effective for fiscal years ending on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
these revisions by the sec are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
these changes include modifying prices used to estimate reserves for sec disclosure purposes to a month average price instead of a single day  period end price 
requiring certain additional disclosures around proved undeveloped reserves  internal controls used to ensure objectivity of the estimation process  and qualifications of those preparing and or auditing the reserves 
expanding the definition of oil and gas reserves and providing clarification of certain concepts and technologies used in the reserve estimation process 
allowing optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves and permitting optional disclosure of price sensitivity analysis 
we are now required to file the report of any third party used to prepare or audit reserves our estimates 
in addition  in january  fasb issued account standards update the update  oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures  to provide consistency with the new reserve rules 
the update amends existing standards to align the reserves calculation and disclosure requirements under gaap with the requirements in the sec s reserve rules 
we adopted the new standards effective december  the new standards are applied prospectively as a change in estimate 
application of the new reserve rules resulted in the use of a lower natural gas price at december  than would have resulted under the previous rules 
as a result  the new pricing methodology rules resulted in a lower net present value pv of economically producible reserves 
the new sec rules require that reserve calculations be based on the un weighted average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months  as contrasted with the previous method which utilized period end prices 
the prices under the new rules were per mcf for natural gas adjusted for energy content  quality and basis differentials 
under the new rules  this resulted in a ceiling test write down of million associated with the us full cost pool 
had we used the price prevailing on december  of per mcf for natural gas  no ceiling test write down would have been recorded 
use of new month average pricing rules at december  also resulted in a decrease in economically producible proved reserves of approximately bcf 
use of the old year end prices rules would have resulted in a decrease in proved reserves of approximately bcf at december  therefore  the total impact of the new price methodology rules resulted in negative reserves revisions of bcf 
because we use quarter end reserves and add back current production to calculate quarterly depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  or dd a  adoption of these new standards had an impact on dd a for the fourth quarter of we estimate the impact of using the unweighted  arithmetic average on the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december   as required by the new reserve rules  instead of year end commodity prices  to be an increase in dd a for the fourth quarter of of approximately on june   we adopted asc formerly sfas no 
subsequent events 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
specifically  asc sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the adoption of asc had no impact on our results  cash flow or financial position as management already followed a similar approach prior to the adoption of this standard 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued amendments to fair value measurements and disclosures under asc topic effective for our financial statements  this guidance provides for disclosures of significant transfers in an out of levels and in addition  the guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding inputs and valuation techniques as well as the appropriate level of disaggregation for fair value measurements and disclosures 
effective for our financial statements  this guidance provides for disclosures of activity on a gross basis within level reconciliation 
risks and uncertainties there are a number of risks that face participants in the us  canadian and international oil and natural gas industry  including a number of risks that face us in particular 
accordingly  there are risks involved in an ownership of our securities 
see risk factors for a description of the principal risks faced by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuating prices of crude oil  natural gas and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to natural gas in the east texas region 
prices received for natural gas are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
currency translation risk 
because our revenues and expenses are primarily in us dollars  we have little exposure to currency translation risk  and  therefore  we have no plans in the foreseeable future to implement hedges or financial instruments to manage international currency changes
