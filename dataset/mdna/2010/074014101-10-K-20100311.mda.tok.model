item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates of this report 
our corporate offices and several of our radio stations are located in florida and other areas that could be affected by hurricanes 
florida is susceptible to hurricanes and we have our corporate offices and eleven radio stations located there 
these radio stations contributed of our net revenue during although the hurricane season did not have a material impact on our operations  our corporate offices and our radio stations located in florida and along the coast of north carolina could be materially affected by hurricanes in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we carry property damage insurance on all of our properties and business interruption insurance on some of our properties  but there can be no assurance that such insurance would be adequate to cover all of our hurricane related losses 
the fcc continues vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the fcc s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and pm 
broadcasters risk of violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material is 
table of contents increased by the vagueness of the fcc s definition of indecent material  coupled with the spontaneity of live programming 
in recent years  the fcc has stepped up its enforcement activities as they apply to indecency  and has threatened to initiate license revocation or license renewal proceedings against broadcast licensees for a category of undefined serious indecency violations 
the fcc has also expanded the breadth of indecency regulation to include material that could be considered blasphemy personally reviling epithets  profanity and vulgar or coarse words amounting to a nuisance 
as a result  in the event that we broadcast material falling within the expanded breadth of the fcc s regulation  we could be subject to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings  which would put the licenses that we depend on for our operations in jeopardy 
in  the monetary penalties for broadcasting indecent programming increased substantially 
other legislative proposals have been keyed to the number of violations found by the fcc and would potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
formerly  the maximum permitted fines for adjudicated violations of the fcc s indecency rules were  per instance and  for each continuing violation 
the current maximum permitted fines are  per incident and  for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act 
several appeals of certain of the fcc s recent enforcement actions and of the fcc s underlying indecency standards are pending in the federal courts 
because the fcc may investigate indecency complaints prior to notifying a licensee of the existence of a complaint  a licensee may not have knowledge of a complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal fcc letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture 
we may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our radio stations broadcast of indecent or obscene material 
to the extent that these pending inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines  revocation of any of our radio station licenses or denials of license renewal applications  our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected 
our business depends on the efforts of key personnel and the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees  including george g 
beasley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
beasley is years old 
we believe the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by mr 
beasley would be difficult to replace and that the loss of mr 
beasley s or other key executives expertise could impair our ability to execute our operating and acquisition strategies 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer controls beasley broadcast group  inc and members of his immediate family own a substantial equity interest in beasley broadcast group  inc their interests may conflict with yours 
george g 
beasley is generally able to control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
without the approval of mr 
beasley  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change in control  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
shares of class b and class a common stock that mr 
beasley beneficially owns represent of the total voting power of all classes of our common stock 
members of his immediate family also own significant amounts of class b common stock 
mr 
beasley will be able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation  third amended and restated bylaws or applicable law 
historically  we have entered into certain transactions with george g 
beasley  members of his immediate family and affiliated entities that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders now or in the future

table of contents future sales by george g 
beasley or members of his family of our class a common stock could adversely affect its market price 
george g 
beasley and members of his family beneficially own the majority of all outstanding shares of class b common stock  which is convertible to class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the market for our class a common stock could change substantially if george g 
beasley and members of his family convert their shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock and then sell large amounts of shares of class a common stock in the public market 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equity related securities in the future 
the difficulties associated with any attempt to gain control of our company may adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 
due to his large holdings of our common stock  george g 
beasley controls the decision whether any change of control of the company will occur 
moreover  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control could be beneficial to you 
in addition  the communications act and fcc rules and policies limit the number of stations that one individual or entity can own  directly or by attribution  in a market 
fcc approval for transfers of control of fcc licensees and assignments of fcc licenses are also required 
because of the limitations and restrictions imposed on us by these provisions and regulations  the trading price of our class a common stock may be adversely affected 
there may not be an active market for our class a common stock  making it difficult for you to sell your stock 
our stock may not be actively traded in the future 
an illiquid market for our stock may result in price volatility and poor execution of buy and sell orders for investors 
our stock price and trading volume have fluctuated widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons that may be unrelated to our business or results of operations 
this market volatility could depress the price of our class a common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our class a common stock could decrease  perhaps significantly

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a radio broadcasting company whose primary business is operating radio stations throughout the united states 
we own and operate radio stations in the following markets philadelphia  pa  atlanta  ga  boston  ma  miami ft 
lauderdale  fl  las vegas  nv  west palm beach boca raton  fl  ft 
myers naples  fl  wilmington  de  greenville new bern jacksonville  nc  augusta  ga and fayetteville  nc 
we also operate wrdw am in the expanded am band in augusta  ga see item business federal regulation of radio broadcasting 
we refer to each group of radio stations that we own in each radio market as a market cluster 
recent developments on march   we amended our credit agreement to revise certain financial covenants 
in addition  the million sub limit for letters of credit was reduced to million 

table of contents financial statement presentation the following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our financial statements and general factors that impact these items 
net revenue 
our net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions  generally of gross revenue 
local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to advertisers in a radio station s local market either directly to the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency 
national revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
national sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm  which serves as our agent in these transactions 
the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels generally determine our net revenue 
advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations  as well as other forms of media  in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and the size of the market 
our net revenue is affected by general economic conditions  competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the radio broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
our revenues are typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we use trade sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services  however  we endeavor to minimize trade revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime 
operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist primarily of programming  engineering  and promotional expenses  reported as cost of services  and selling  general and administrative expenses incurred at our radio stations  general and administrative expenses  including compensation and other expenses  incurred at our corporate offices  and depreciation and amortization 
we strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in and in  which differs from the federal statutory rate of due to the effect of state income taxes and certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate also includes additional tax expense in and from the vesting of restricted stock in and at stock prices lower than the grant date stock prices of those awards 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  also reflects a million increase to the valuation allowance for unrealized losses on investments which we have determined  more likely than not  that such losses will not be utilized 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and 
table of contents changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
fcc broadcasting licenses 
as of december   fcc broadcasting licenses with an aggregate carrying amount of million represented of our total assets 
we are required to test our fcc broadcasting licenses for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that our licenses might be impaired 
the annual test  which is performed as of november  compares the fair value of our licenses with their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amounts of the licenses exceeds their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we combine our licenses into reporting units based on our market clusters for impairment testing purposes 
we estimate the fair value of our licenses using an income approach 
the income approach measures the expected economic benefits the licenses provide and discounts these future benefits using discounted cash flow analyses 
the discounted cash flow analyses assume that each license is held by a hypothetical start up radio station and the value yielded by the discounted cash flow analyses represents the portion of the radio station s value attributable solely to its license 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates variables such as radio market revenues  the projected growth rate for radio market revenues  projected radio market revenue share  projected radio station operating income margins  and a discount rate appropriate for the radio broadcasting industry 
the variables used in the analyses reflect historical radio station and market growth trends  as well as anticipated radio station performance  industry standards  and market conditions 
the discounted cash flow projection period of ten years was determined to be an appropriate time horizon for the analyses 
stable market revenue share and operating margins are expected at the end of year three maturity 
as of november   the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses are as follows revenue growth rate market revenue shares at maturity operating income margins at maturity discount rate if we had made different assumptions or used different estimates  the fair value of our licenses could have been materially different 
if actual results are different from assumptions or estimates used in the discounted cash flow analyses  we may incur impairment losses in the future and they may be material 
cash flows and operating income are dependent on advertising revenues 
advertising revenues are influenced by competition from other radio stations and media  demographic changes  and changes in government rules and regulations 
in addition  advertising is generally considered a discretionary expense meaning advertising expenditures tend to decline disproportionately during economic downturns as compared to other types of business expenditures 
the discounted cash flow analyses reflect a revenue growth rate of in and a modest recovery beginning in if actual results are lower  we may incur impairment losses in the future and they may be material 

table of contents the carrying amount of fcc broadcasting licenses for each reporting unit and the percentage by which fair value exceeded carrying value is as follows market cluster fcc broadcasting licenses excess miami fort lauderdale  fl philadelphia  pa wilmington  de las vegas  nv fort myers naples  fl fayetteville  nc greenville new bern jacksonville  nc augusta  ga west palm beach boca raton  fl atlanta  ga boston  ma as a result of our annual test during the fourth quarter of  we recorded no impairment losses related to our fcc broadcasting licenses 
however  there can be no assurance that impairments of our fcc broadcasting licenses will not occur in future periods 
goodwill 
as of december   goodwill with an aggregate carrying amount of million represented of our total assets 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill might be impaired 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process which is performed as of december the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their carrying amount  including goodwill 
for the purpose of testing our goodwill for impairment  we have identified our market clusters as our reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
we used the average of i a multiple ranging from to times projected operating income for each market cluster  and ii a discounted cash flow analysis for each market cluster to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
radio stations are generally sold on the basis of a multiple of projected operating income 
if we had made different assumptions or used different estimates  the fair value of our reporting units could have been materially different 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses are as follows revenue growth rate operating income margins discount rate 
table of contents the carrying amount of goodwill for each reporting unit and the percentage by which the reporting unit fair value exceeded the carrying amount after step is as follows market cluster goodwill step excess deficit miami fort lauderdale  fl wilmington  de fort myers naples  fl fayetteville  nc greenville new bern jacksonville  nc the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its goodwill carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
in other words  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we used the fair value of each reporting unit determined in step as the implied purchased price paid for the reporting unit in step the percentage by which implied goodwill fair value exceeded the carrying amount after step is as follows market cluster step excess wilmington  de as a result of our annual test during the fourth quarter of  we recorded no impairment losses related to our goodwill 
however  there can be no assurance that impairments of our goodwill will not occur in future periods 
property and equipment 
we are required to assess the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever an event has occurred that may result in an impairment loss 
if such an event occurs  we will compare estimates of related future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we will reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value 
the determination of when an event has occurred and estimates of future cash flows and fair value all require management judgment 
the use of different assumptions or estimates may result in alternative assessments that could be materially different 
we did not identify any events that may have resulted in an impairment loss on our property and equipment in there can be no assurance that impairment of our property and equipment will not occur in future periods 
accounts receivable 
we continually evaluate our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
our ongoing evaluation includes review of specific accounts at our radio stations  the current financial condition of our customers and our historical write off experience 
this ongoing evaluation requires management judgment and if we had made different assumptions about these factors  the allowance for doubtful accounts could have been materially different 
recent pronouncements in january  the fasb issued new guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and fair value 
table of contents measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
the guidance also requires a reporting entity to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december  and with respect to certain of our key financial measures 
these changes illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below 
this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in item of this report

net revenue decreased at all of our eleven market clusters 
net revenue decreased million at our miami fort lauderdale market cluster  million at our philadelphia market cluster  million at our las vegas market cluster  million at our fayetteville market cluster  million at our greenville new bern jacksonville market cluster  million at our fort myers naples market cluster  million at our wilmington market cluster  million at our west palm beach boca raton market cluster  and million at our augusta market cluster 
cost of services 
the million decrease in cost of services during the year ended december  was primarily due to cost containment measures in response to the decrease in net revenue 
cost of services decreased at ten of our eleven market clusters and was comparable to at the remaining market cluster 
cost of services decreased million at our miami fort lauderdale market cluster  million at our las vegas market cluster  million at our philadelphia market cluster  million at our fort myers naples market cluster  and million at our greenville new bern jacksonville market cluster

corporate general and administrative expenses 
the million decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in cash and stock based compensation expense and other cost containment measures 
impairment losses 
we tested our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill for impairment as of december  and as a result of the testing in  we recorded impairment losses of million related to the fcc broadcasting licenses in our wilmington  de  las vegas  nv  augusta  ga  west palm beach boca raton  fl  atlanta  ga and boston  ma market clusters and impairment losses of million related to the goodwill recorded in our wilmington  de  las vegas  nv and augusta  ga market clusters 
net gain on sale or disposal of assets 
on august   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets used in the operation of radio station kbet am and certain assets used in the operation of radio stations kcye fm and kfrh fm in las vegas  nevada to silver state broadcasting llc and recorded a million gain on disposition of radio stations during the third quarter of interest expense 
the million increase in interest expense during the year ended december  was due to an increase in our interest rate as a result of the amendment to our credit agreement during the first quarter of and the swap agreements we entered during the second and third quarters of these increases were offset with reduced borrowing costs as a result of a general decline in interest rates and scheduled and voluntary repayments of borrowings under our credit facility 
loss on extinguishment of long term debt 
in connection with an amendment to our credit facility during the first quarter of  we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of long term debt during the year ended december  non operating expenses 
the decrease in non operating expenses during the year ended december  was primarily due to other than temporary impairment losses of million on our investments in miva and ioworldmedia in income tax expense benefit 
the increase in income taxes was primarily due to a deferred tax benefit of million related to the impairment losses of million on our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill for the year ended december  net income loss 
as a result of the factors described above  net income for the year ended december  was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources overview 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit loan 
our primary liquidity needs have been  and for the next twelve months and thereafter are expected to continue to be  for working capital  debt service  and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and radio station acquisitions 
historically  our capital expenditures have not been significant 
in addition to property and equipment associated with radio station acquisitions  our capital expenditures have generally been  and are expected to continue to be  related to the maintenance of our studio and office space and the technological improvement  including upgrades necessary to broadcast hd radio  and maintenance of our broadcasting towers and equipment 
we have also purchased or constructed office and studio space in some of our markets to facilitate the consolidation of our operations 

table of contents prior to march   our credit facility permitted us to repurchase up to million of our common stock and on june   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our class a common stock over a one year period from the date of authorization  which was extended on may  for one additional year

in august  we repaid million of the outstanding balance under our credit facility with proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the assets used in the operation of radio station kbet am and certain assets used in the operation of radio stations kcye fm and kfrh fm in las vegas  nevada 
we expect to provide for future liquidity needs through one or a combination of the following sources of liquidity internally generated cash flow  our credit facility  additional borrowings  other than under our existing credit facility  to the extent permitted thereunder  and additional equity offerings 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to permit us to provide for our liquidity requirements and meet our financial obligations for the next twelve months 
however  poor financial results  unanticipated acquisition opportunities or unanticipated expenses could give rise to defaults under our credit facility  additional debt servicing requirements or other additional financing or liquidity requirements sooner than we expect and we may not secure financing when needed or on acceptable terms 
our ability to reduce our total debt ratio  as defined by our credit agreement  by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under the revolving portion of our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility
