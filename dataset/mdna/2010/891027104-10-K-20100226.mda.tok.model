item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance  and to a limited extent annuities  to middle income households throughout the united states 
we view our operations by segments  which are the major insurance product lines of life  health  and annuities  and the investment segment that supports the product lines 
segments are aligned based on their common characteristics  comparability of the profit margins  and management techniques used to operate each segment 
insurance product line segments 
as fully described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the product line segments involve the marketing  underwriting  and benefit administration of policies 
each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies 
each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market 
whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole  or the individual distribution units within the segment  the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin  which is premium revenue less policy obligations policy acquisition costs and commissions investment segment 
the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources  including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity 
our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income  which is net investment income less interest credited to net policy liabilities financing costs the tables in note business segments reconcile torchmark s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three year period ending december  additionally  this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year to year comparability and which reconciles to net income 
that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark s operations on a segment by segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 
summary of operations net income declined million or in to million 
in  net income declined million or to million from million 
on a diluted per share basis  net income fell to  while in per share net income declined to 
one major cause for the decline in both years was after tax realized investment losses  due mostly to writedowns of fixed maturity securities that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
in  after tax realized investment losses reduced per share earnings  of which per share related to other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities which were offset by 
of net gains 
in  after tax losses accounted for 
per share  of which 
related to other than temporary impairments 
in  we had realized investment gains which added 
to per diluted share earnings  after other than temporary impairment writedowns of 
per share offset 
of other gains for the period 
another contributing factor to the declines in both years was in our health insurance segment  where intense competition in recent periods has resulted in significant declines in agent counts  which in turn has resulted in lower sales of new health products 
health underwriting margins declined million or in to million  after having decreased million or in life insurance was our strongest performing segment in both and  contributing million to pretax growth in both periods 
margin improvements in this segment were primarily a result of premium growth 
the investment segment also contributed to the growth in pretax income in  as excess investment income  the measure of profitability of the investment segment  rose million 
however  this segment s contribution declined million in  as we held significantly more cash in and as a significant amount of higher yielding lower rated investments were sold with the proceeds reinvested in lower yielding but higher rated securities in that year 
another factor in the decline in excess investment income was that we issued million of new debt in june and repaid our million senior debentures which matured in august  resulting in increased financing costs which reduced excess investment income 
our annuity margins have fluctuated in recent periods 
our annuity underwriting loss was million  compared with gains of million in and million in in  significant declines 
table of contents in equity markets caused variable policyholder account values to decline  guaranteed minimum death benefit costs to increase  policyholders to withdraw funds  and changes in actuarial assumptions all of which resulted in the underwriting losses 
as equity markets improved during  many of these factors abated somewhat and margins partially recovered 
we do not emphasize this segment and discontinued the sale of variable annuities in  only offering a fixed annuity product 
total revenues declined in to billion 
in  total revenues declined to billion from billion in life premium rose million in and million in net investment income rose million in and million in however  growth in revenues in both and were negatively affected by the aforementioned pretax realized investment losses and declines in health premium  described further under this caption 
life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december   rising in to billion and also in margins as a percentage of premium have also held steady each year at of premium 
life net sales rose in to million and in to million 
life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 
we market three primary health insurance products under age limited benefit health insurance  medicare supplement insurance  and the medicare part d prescription drug benefit 
health premium declined in to billion from billion in health premium declined in the primary factor in the decreases in both years was the decline in agent count in our united american branch office during the year  our largest health producer 
this agency has experienced intense competition  which has resulted in a significant decrease in new health sales and has negatively impacted premium income 
this agency had historically focused on sales of our limited benefit health product  as demand for this product had increased 
accordingly  premium from the limited benefit product grew significantly in relation to medicare supplement premium in recent years 
however  with the decline in the size of this agency beginning in  premium for the limited benefit product has declined 
medicare supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium  but increased competition has also dampened sales of this product  resulting in premium declines in each successive year 
it should be noted  however  that net sales for medicare supplement insurance rose in for the first time in several years 
this was a result of the increase in group medical supplement sales 
we also offer medicare part d insurance 
as most of the country s part d enrollees selected a plan provider in  we do not expect significant growth in our part d business going forward 
see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 
as noted earlier  we no longer offer variable annuities 
while we still offer fixed annuities  we do not emphasize sales of annuity products  favoring life insurance instead 
see the caption annuities for further discussion of the annuity segment 
as previously mentioned  the investment segment s pretax profitability  or excess investment income  increased million in but declined million in profitability in this segment is based on three major components net investment income  required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to and assigned to insurance products  and financing costs 
in recent years  growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio 
one of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of 
another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested 
during these lags  we have held cash at lower yields 
among the most important factors contributing to the relatively lower growth rate in investment income during is the fact that  due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets  we held significantly more cash and short term investments during than we did during and additionally  in  we sold a significant portion of higher yielding but lower rated fixed maturities and reinvested the proceeds in lower yielding but higher rated bonds in to improve our risk adjusted return 
this also contributed to reduced net investment income 
the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income  and generally grows in conjunction with the insurance policy reserves that are supported by the invested assets 
financing costs  which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short term debt  are also deducted from excess investment income 
in  interest expense 
table of contents on our long term debt rose million 
during the year we issued our million senior notes but repaid our million senior debentures  resulting in a higher balance of debt outstanding at a higher interest rate 
however  this segment has benefited from lower short term financing costs in each successive year  as these costs have declined primarily due to lower rates on our short term debt 
prior to  growth in total investment income has been somewhat negatively affected by torchmark s share repurchase program described later under this caption  which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments 
torchmark s current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investment grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives 
approximately of our invested assets at fair value consists of fixed maturities of which was investment grade at december  the average quality rating of the portfolio was bbb 
the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alt a mortgages  no direct investment in residential mortgages  no counterparty risks  no credit default swaps  or derivative contracts 
see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and note investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 
as mentioned earlier in this summary  we wrote down certain securities in each of the years through  as these securities met our criteria for other than temporary impairment 
the pretax impairment losses were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
please refer to note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption other than temporary impairments and under the caption realized gains and losses in this report for more information on these writedowns and our criteria for consideration of other than temporary impairment 
including the writedowns  we had total after tax realized investment losses of million in per share and million in 
per share  compared with a million gain in 
per share 
realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
under the caption realized gains and losses in this report  we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses including the writedowns 
also  as explained in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 
during the second quarter of  we issued a new debt security  our senior notes  par value million 
funds from this offering were used to repay our senior debentures which matured in the third quarter of in the amount of million 
we also used million to strengthen the capital position of certain of our insurance subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions and surplus notes 
the regulatory capital positions of these subsidiaries had been negatively affected by rating agency downgrades of bonds in their investment portfolios 
the subsidiaries in turn invested these funds in investment grade fixed maturities 
more information on these transactions can be found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 
in each of the years through  net income was affected by certain significant  unusual  and nonrecurring nonoperating items 
we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations 
a discussion of these items follows 
as reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption litigation and tax settlements  we have been involved in a number of litigation issues over the course of the three year period through in which we either received settlements net of expenses or incurred settlement losses and expenses 
these issues resulted in after tax charges of thousand in and thousand in additionally  as described under the same caption of note  we received tax settlements in each year in the amounts of million in  million in  and million in all of these litigation and tax issues pertained to issues arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations 
legal and litigation expenses pertaining to current operations are included in either insurance administrative expenses or parent expenses  as appropriate  in our segment analysis 
income from 
table of contents litigation settlements is included in other income 
as explained in note investments under the caption other than temporary impairments  we wrote down certain company occupied property to fair value during both and the write downs resulted in after tax charges of thousand in and million in prior to  liberty began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings  replacing them with rental facilities 
in  buildings were sold for proceeds of million and a pretax gain of million million after tax 
the program began to wind down in as five buildings were sold for proceeds of thousand and a pretax gain of thousand thousand after tax 
because of the significant scale of this nonoperating activity  we have removed these amounts from our core results in and no buildings were sold in five buildings remained to be sold at december  torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in with no specified authorization amount  we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company s excess cash flow  general market conditions  and other alternative uses 
the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable 
additionally  when stock options are exercised  proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises 
due to economic conditions at the time  we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of we may resume the program with a reaffirmation by the board of directors when share repurchases are determined to be the best use of cash 
the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december  analysis of share purchases amounts in thousands purchases shares amount shares amount shares amount excess cash flow and borrowings option proceeds total throughout the remainder of this discussion  share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings 
a discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
life insurance 
life insurance is our largest insurance segment  with life premium representing of total premium 
life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total in additionally  investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 
throughout  we have been in the process of combining selected united american ua exclusive agency branch offices with the liberty national exclusive agency 
for this reason  all premium income and margin data will be reported on a combined basis in this report 
however  we will continue to report sales data and agent counts separately 

table of contents life insurance premium rose to billion in after having increased in to billion 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels 
premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency other agencies we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term annualized premium in force  net sales  and first year collected premium 
annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve month period 
annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue 
net sales is annualized premium issued  net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue  except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired 
we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued 
first year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year 
first year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur  and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december   an increase of over billion a year earlier 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december  the following table shows net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method

table of contents the table below discloses first year collected life premium by distribution channel 
life insurance first year collected premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency other agencies direct response is one of our leading writers of life insurance 
the direct response operation consists of two primary components direct mail and insert media 
direct mail targets primarily young middle income households with children 
the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product 
not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales  but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders 
parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population 
also  both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 
at this time  we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance 
we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response s premier markets 
the insert media area targets primarily the adult market 
it involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media  such as coupon packets  newspapers  bank statements  and billings 
this media was historically placed by direct marketing and advertising distributors  inc dmad  previously an unrelated entity which we acquired and integrated their operations into ours during this acquisition allowed the company to expand marketing opportunities through increased solicitation volume and also improve margins through cost savings in the insert media component 
the direct response operation accounted for of our life insurance premium during  the largest of any distribution group 
life premium for this channel rose in and in net sales rose in to million after an gain in to million 
first year collected premium increased in to million after a gain in the american income exclusive agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions  but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
life premium for this agency rose to million in  after having increased in net sales increased in to million from million in net sales rose in first year collected premium rose in to million  after having increased in as in the case of all of torchmark s agency distribution systems  continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count 
growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency 
the american income agent count was  at december  compared with  a year earlier  an increase of 
the agent count rose in from  at year end this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business 
additionally  the systematic  centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents 
as previously mentioned  we have combined selected ua exclusive agency branch offices with the liberty national exclusive agency 
the liberty national agency has historically marketed life insurance to middle income customers primarily in the southeast 
the ua branch office agency has historically emphasized health products  but is now changing its focus for newly recruited agents to market liberty national s life and health products 
in addition  due to ongoing cuts in medicare advantage funding and changes to the competitive environment in the medicare supplement market  we have also recently renewed our emphasis on medicare supplement sales 
life premium income for this combined agency was 
table of contents million for  a decrease compared with million in life premium for this agency declined in from first year collected premium on a combined basis rose to million in  after having increased in liberty national s net sales declined to million in  after having increased a year earlier 
the liberty agency had  producing agents at december   compared with  a year earlier  a decline of 
the agent count at liberty had increased in from  the decrease in agent count was due primarily to agent compensation issues 
a two tier bonus threshold proved more difficult for producing agents to meet than anticipated 
management reverted to a level bonus threshold during the third quarter of in addition  due to deteriorating first year persistency rates on business written over the past several quarters  management modified compensation incentives in the third quarter of to place more emphasis on retention 
this has resulted in the departure of some of the weaker agents 
management expects the counts to increase in the ua branch office agency produced net sales of million in of liberty national s life products 
as noted earlier  this agency traditionally focused on health product sales 
due to intense competition in recent periods in the health insurance market  the ua branch has experienced sharp declines in agent count 
the ua branch office agency had producing agents at december   compared with  agents a year earlier  a decline of 
the count declined in from  agents 
as is the case with all of our captive agency forces  growing the number of productive agents is critical to the growth in sales 
as mentioned above  we have shifted the emphasis in the ua branch office agency to life and health products currently marketed by liberty national agents  as well as a renewed focus on medicare supplement products 
these products are priced to achieve higher profit margins and have better persistency than the ua branch s limited benefit health insurance 
this agency will continue to offer the current product portfolio  but the majority of our financial incentives will be used to encourage new agents to sell the liberty national product line along with the renewed focus on ua medicare supplement products 
we believe this will improve the stability and profitability of the ua branch office agency 
we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the united investors agency  the military agency  the united american independent agency  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business 
united investors represented of torchmark s life premium income 
the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders 
military premium represented of life premium 
the united american independent agency represented less than of torchmark s total life premium 
this agency is focused on health insurance  with life sales being incidental

table of contents gross margins  as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense  rose in to million after also rising in as a percentage of life insurance premium  gross margins have been stable each year at 
margin growth in all periods was primarily the result of premium growth 
health insurance 
health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limited benefit cancer  accident plans  and hospital surgical plans sold to people under age we also sell medicare supplements to enrollees in the federal medicare program  as well as providing coverage under the medicare part d prescription drug program 
the limited benefit health plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined  a fixed amount surgical schedule  outpatient coverage  and other miscellaneous hospital related charges 
they also contain caps on total per illness benefits 
consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers 
minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limited benefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement  however  the medicare supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates  resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium 
in recent years  sales of the under age limited benefit product have exceeded medicare supplement sales  as customers demand for the limited benefit product increased and price competition and reduced demand for medicare supplements dampened sales of that product 
however  medicare supplement continues to be our largest health product in terms of premium income 
additionally  in the past two years  medicare supplement sales have grown steadily in relation to limited benefit sales  due in part to changes in agent counts in our health distribution groups discussed below 

table of contents total health premium represented of torchmark s total premium income in excluding part d premium  health premium represented in  compared with in and in health underwriting margin  excluding part d  accounted for of the total in  compared with in and in these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment 
health results have also been negatively affected by increased competition in recent periods

this risk sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims  and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis

the medicare part d health product will be presented and discussed separately in this report 
health insurance  excluding medicare part d 
as noted under the caption life insurance  we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health  due to life s superior margins and other benefits 
our health distribution groups have also encountered increased competition in recent periods 
the increased competition has led to losses in agents in our ua branch office and independent agencies 
agent turnover has increased as lower premium  lower margin products offered by competitors have provided agents with products that are easier to sell 
declines in these agent counts have resulted in lower net sales  which in turn have pressured premium growth 
health premium  excluding part d premium  fell to million in  after declining in medicare supplement premium declined to million in  compared with a decline in other limited benefit health premium dropped in to million  after a decline of in net sales  excluding medicare part d  declined to million in net sales fell in to million 
medicare supplement net sales rose in  however  while other health net sales declined 
in  both medicare supplement and other health net sales declined  medicare supplement declined and other limited benefit health fell 
first year collected premium also declined significantly in both and while new sales of our limited benefit health products have been stronger than our medicare supplement plans  medicare supplement net sales have been gaining in recent periods in relation to 
table of contents other limited benefit products 
medicare supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium  representing of non part d health premium in because medicare supplement products are generally more persistent than the limited benefit products  medicare supplement premium grew to in relative proportion to limited benefit premium in compared with for the two prior years 
as previously mentioned under the caption life insurance  we have combined selected ua exclusive agency branch offices with the liberty national exclusive agency 
this combination has resulted in this agency being torchmark s largest in terms of health premium income and net sales 
in  this agency represented of all torchmark non part d income health premium at million 
the ua branch has historically been torchmark s largest health distributor  marketing limited benefit health products and medicare supplements 
liberty also markets limited benefit products  concentrating on cancer insurance 
in  health premium income of million in the combined agency declined from prior year premium of million 
premium also fell in from million 
first year collected premium fell to million in  after declining a year earlier 
as noted earlier  increased competition in the health insurance market has caused declines in agent counts particularly in the ua branch agency 
the decline in agent counts has resulted in decreased new sales  translating into declines in premium 
the ua branch office net sales for declined from million in to million of which million was for sales of liberty national products in 
in  this agency s net sales fell 
as discussed under the caption life insurance  the ua branch office agent count has fallen significantly each year  in to  agents and in to agents 
these declines have negatively impacted net sales and premium growth 
this effect has been more notable in torchmark s health segment as this agency is a more prominent factor in our health operations 
also discussed under the life insurance caption are efforts designed to strengthen this agency 
liberty s health net sales were relatively flat in  but rose to million in on sales of limited benefit health products  primarily cancer 
liberty s net sales as a portion of total non part d health net sales rose from in to in to in the ua independent agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large  multi state organizations down to one person offices 
all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies  of which  were active producing agents for torchmark at december  this agency is our largest carrier of medicare supplement insurance  with million or of our medicare supplement premium income in this agency s relative contribution to torchmark s total health sales has increased in each of the past three years 
net sales for this agency rose to million in medicare supplement net sales of million more than doubled in over net sales of million in and almost doubled sales of million in these increases in were due to increases in group medicare supplement sales 
total health premium income for the ua independent agency was million in  a decline from premium of million 
premium income declined in from the declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses 
the american income exclusive agency  also predominantly a life insurance distribution channel  is our third largest health insurance distributor based on premium collected 
its health plans are comprised of various limited benefit plans for which approximately of the agency s health premium was from accident policies 
sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 
health premium at this agency rose in to million  after having increased to million in net health sales were million in  compared with million in and million in net health sales comprised less than of the american income agency s total net sales in direct response  primarily a life operation  also offers health insurance  which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups 
in  net health sales were million  comprising approximately of direct response s total life and health net sales 
direct response health net sales and premium income have risen each year over the prior year 
net sales increased in and in health premium rose in to million and in medicare part d 
torchmark  through its subsidiary united american  began offering insurance coverage under the government s medicare part d plan as of january  the medicare part d plan 
table of contents is a stand alone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries 
part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american  unlike the traditional medicare program for hospital and doctor services  where cms is the primary insurer and private medicare supplement insurers are secondary insurers 
the program generally calls for cms to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium 
total medicare part d premium was million in  compared with million in and million in changes in part d premium generally result from changes in the number of enrollees 
enrollment for all part d coverages ends on december of the previous year  except for enrollees who reach age in the current year 
at december   united american had approximately thousand enrollees for the part d plan  compared with thousand for the plan year and thousand for the plan year 
our medicare part d product is sold primarily through the direct response operation  but is also sold by the ua independent agency 
part d net sales were million in  compared with million in and million in we count only sales to new first time enrollees in net sales  and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees 
we believe that the medicare part d program is a meaningful component to our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior age market and with medicare supplements  the government assurances with regard to the risk sharing agreements for participating insurers  the incremental income added to our health insurance margins  and the renewal of the business every year 
due to our experience with service to the senior age market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system  entry to this business required little new investment 
however  we do not expect significant growth in the part d product in the near future  as most medicare beneficiaries have already chosen a plan 
additionally  as with any government sponsored program  the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

annuities summary of results dollar amounts in thousands at december  policy charges policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense underwriting income attributable to fixed annuities variable annuities insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense a significant portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements 
this spread sometimes results in negative net policy obligations 
variable annuities generate earnings from periodic policy charges and fees to the account balances  reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs 
instability and declines in equity markets over the past two years have had a significant negative effect on the average variable annuity policyholder account balance  especially in  as market volatility has resulted in declines in the value of the underlying investments and caused increased policyholder withdrawals 
as noted above  we also withdrew from the variable annuity market in and no longer market these products 
these events have pressured annuity revenues and accordingly underwriting income in and particularly in 
table of contents underwriting income on our variable business has been recently affected by two major factors other than policy charges 
our products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits providing a minimum death benefit regardless of policyholder account value upon death 
for this reason  we provide a reserve for this benefit  the cost of which increases as the policyholder account value declines 
additionally  because of changes in the account balance size  we expect that future revenues and profits will also change accordingly 
therefore  the projections with regard to the deferred acquisition costs associated with this business are revised  resulting in a charge or credit to reflect this revision or true up of the projections 
because equity markets declined significantly in the latter part of  the guaranteed death benefit and the true up related to deferred acquisition costs increased substantially in  from thousand in to million 
as a result of the partial recovery of the equity markets in  the charge to underwriting income for the guaranteed death benefit reserve adjustment and true up adjustment was reduced to million 
the variable annuity business is our only business where revenue and margins are significantly impacted by changes in equity markets 
while the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year  policy charges and underwriting income have fluctuated only modestly 
the stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist of surrender charges and are not based on account size 
these charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods 
a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements  which can result in negative net policy obligations 
in  investment income for fixed annuities increased as a result of the assignment of higher yielding new investments to this product as older lower yielding investments matured and rolled off over time 
as the income has grown at a greater rate than the fund balance  the spread has widened 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits 
administrative expenses 
operating expenses are included in the other and corporate segments and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company 
the following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended december  operating expenses selected information dollar amounts in thousands amount of prem

table of contents insurance administrative expenses declined in  after having risen in as a percentage of premium  they declined to in  after having risen from in to in in  increases in salaries were more than offset by declines in other administrative costs and other employee costs 
as a result of the effort to achieve greater consistency in expense classification among our subsidiaries  we deferred million more of deferrable administrative expense to acquisition expense in compared with these reductions in administrative expense were partially offset by increases in pension and other employee benefit costs during the period 
the additional deferred costs will increase the amortization of acquisition costs in future periods 
the increase was primarily a result of higher salary expenses  pension costs  and other costs such as postage and property taxes 
the increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses and medicare part d administrative expense 
management believes that pension cost will stabilize in  because of the partial recovery in financial markets 
parent company expense was lower in than in the two prior periods 
included in and expenses were charges in the amount of million in and million in for expenses incurred related to potential acquisition bids that were not successful 
as mentioned in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we settled litigation in prior periods relating to issues occurring many years ago  but incurred million in legal costs in and thousand in as previously noted  we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations 
stock compensation expense declined in  primarily as a result of the lower stock price caused by the severe market decline in and the effect it had on values at the time of our annual stock and stock option grants for expense related to the new grants replaced the expense for costlier older grants that became fully vested 
stock compensation expense rose in because was the first year after adoption of the accounting rule requiring the expensing of stock options where we had three years of annual employee grants being expensed  and 
the employee grant was fully vested in before adoption and there was no grant in new restricted stock grants in each of the three years through  which generally vest over five years  have also contributed to the increases in and stock compensation expense 
management believes that stock compensation expense will increase slightly in as stated in note business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense  and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 
as described in note investments under the caption other than temporary impairments  we wrote down certain company occupied real estate because it met our criteria as described in that note for other than temporary impairment 
as a result  we incurred a pretax charge of million in and thousand in which is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the respective year 
investments 
we manage our capital resources including investments  debt  and cash flow through the investment segment 
excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations 
it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding  representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company 
since implementing our share repurchase program in  we have used billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives 
share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets  but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding 
in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis  we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment

growth in net investment income growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost one of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of 
another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested 
one of the most important factors contributing to the relatively lower growth rate in investment income during is the fact that  due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets  we held significantly more cash and short term investments during than we did during and had we not done so  and if short term investment rates had not been much lower during than in  the growth rate in investment income during would have been approximately the same as the growth rate in mean assets 

table of contents excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt 
information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 
interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities dollar amounts in millions interest credited average net insurance policy liabilities average crediting rate life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in revised from previously reported to exclude the unrealized gains and losses on deferred acquisition costs 
the average interest crediting rate has risen in each of the last three years 
in  as part of our normal review of policy reserve assumptions  we increased the interest rate assumption basis points on policies issued after january  as this group of policies becomes a larger proportion of our business  the average crediting rate will continue to increase 
for more specific information on life and health crediting rates  please refer to note future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs 
financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income 
the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs 
reconciliation of interest expense to financing costs amounts in thousands interest expense per consolidated statements of operations reclassification of interest due to deconsolidation financing costs see principles of consolidation in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an explanation of deconsolidation

short term interest expense was million lower in  as a result of significantly lower interest rates when compared with the decline resulted from a decrease in short term interest rates during  as well as a decline in our average commercial paper balance for the year to million 
excess investment income benefits from increases in long term rates available on new investments and decreases in short term borrowing rates 
of these two factors  higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short term rates 
investment acquisitions 
torchmark s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment grade fixed maturities generally with long maturities maturity date more than years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives 
we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long term nature of our policy liabilities 
we believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable 
if such longer term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives  new money is invested short term  generally with maturities less than five years 
during calendar years through  torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities 
investments were primarily made in corporate securities  although some municipal bonds were acquired in and there were virtually no below investment grade securities acquired and the average rating of investments acquired in each year was a 
investment grade corporate securities include both bonds and trust preferred securities which are classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors 

table of contents the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases 
the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield 
this date is commonly known as the worst call date 
two different average life calculations are shown  average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date 
fixed maturity acquisitions selected information dollar amounts in millions for the year cost of acquisitions investment grade corporate securities tax exempt municipal securities taxable municipal securities other investment grade securities total fixed maturity acquisitions effective annual yield one year compounded average life in years  to next call average life in years to maturity average rating a a a tax equivalent basis  where the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities 
we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a make whole basis prior to maturity  but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so 
for investments in callable bonds  the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not and if so  when the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date 
given our investments in callable bonds  the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment 
however  the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity 
data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 
during and  we invested considerable funds in fixed maturity securities bonds  trust preferred securities  and redeemable preferred stocks with longer scheduled maturity dates  often exceeding years 
in virtually all cases  such securities have a scheduled maturity date and are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date 
because of the changing investment environment later in  we were able to achieve our yield and quality objectives with investments in securities with somewhat shorter average lives and maturities 
as a result  the average life of funds invested during to both next call and maturity was somewhat lower than that of investments during and new cash flow available to us for investment has been affected by issuer calls as a result of the low interest environment experienced during the past three years  especially issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost 
calls increase funds available for investment  but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called 
issuer calls were million in  million in  and million in the level of calls was unusual  and contributed to the significant increase in funds invested in that year 
the higher level of acquisitions in was primarily due to the additional cash flow available from the special sales transactions noted below 

table of contents sales transactions 
as disclosed in note investments  the company sold million of fixed maturities at amortized cost in the third quarter of  including million of below investment grade securities 
the market value for some of these securities increased significantly during the period to a level where  even though the sales price was less than amortized cost  management determined that better risk adjusted returns could be achieved by selling rather than continuing to hold the securities 
other securities were sold at prices that produced gains to offset these losses for tax purposes 
due in large part to selling below investment grade securities and reinvesting the proceeds in investment grade securities  below investment grade securities as a percentage of total fixed maturities at amortized cost declined from at june  to at december  the reduction in below investment grade securities had a positive impact on the risk based capital position of our insurance subsidiaries 
portfolio analysis 
because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities  the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms 
the following table presents a comparison of torchmark s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december  with the latest industry data 
torchmark amount in millions industry bonds preferred stock redeemable and perpetual common stocks mortgage loans real estate policy loans other invested assets short terms latest data available from the american council of life insurance as of december  includes redeemable preferred of billion or and perpetual preferred of million or 
at december   approximately of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixed maturity portfolio 
policy loans  which are secured by policy cash values  made up an additional 
the remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities  mortgage loans  and other long term and short term investments 

table of contents because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio  the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities 
an analysis of our fixed maturity portfolio by component at december  and december  is as follows fixed maturities by component at december  dollar amounts in millions cost or amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value of total fixed maturities amortized cost fair value corporates redeemable preferred stock municipals government sponsored enterprises governments agencies residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities collateralized debt obligations other asset backed securities total fixed maturities fixed maturities by component at december  dollar amounts in millions cost or amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value of total fixed maturities amortized cost fair value corporates redeemable preferred stock municipals government sponsored enterprises governments agencies residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities collateralized debt obligations other asset backed securities total fixed maturities 
table of contents at december   fixed maturities had a fair value of billion  compared with billion at december  net unrealized losses on fixed maturities declined from billion at december  to million at december  approximately of our fixed maturity assets at december  at amortized cost were corporate bonds and were redeemable preferred stocks 
this compares with corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks at year end at december   less than of the assets at amortized cost were residential and commercial mortgage backed securities  other asset backed securities  and collateralized debt obligations cdos 
the million of cdos at amortized cost made up less than of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies 
the million of mortgage backed securities are rated aaa 
for more information about our fixed maturity portfolio by component at december  and  including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities  see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additional information concerning the fixed maturity portfolio is as follows 
fixed maturity portfolio selected information at december  at december  average annual effective yield average life  in years  to next call maturity effective duration to next call  maturity  tax equivalent basis  whereby the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities 
torchmark calculates the average life and duration of the fixed maturity portfolio two ways a based on the next call date which is the next call date for callable bonds and the maturity date for noncallable bonds  and b based on the maturity date of all bonds  whether callable or not 
effective duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to a particular change in interest rates 
the increase in effective duration during was due in large part to significantly lower discount rates implied by the increase in the market value of the portfolio  which increases sensitivity to changes in rates 

table of contents credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk is the level of certainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
approximately of our fixed maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and asset backed securities 
as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
we mitigate this ongoing risk  in part  by acquiring investment grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis 
we also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors 
the following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at december  fixed maturities by sector at december  dollar amounts in millions cost or amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value of total fixed maturities at amortized cost at fair value financial life health pc insurance financial bank financial financial guarantor financial mortgage insurer financial insurance broker financial other utilities energy consumer non cyclical consumer cyclical communications basic materials transportation other industrials collateralized debt obligations mortgage backed securities government technology total fixed maturities at december   approximately of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost at fair value were in the financial sector  including in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and in banks at amortized cost 
financial guarantors  mortgage insurers  and insurance brokers comprised approximately of the portfolio 
after financials  the next largest sector was utilities  which comprised of the portfolio at amortized cost 
the balance of the portfolio is spread among issuers in a wide variety of sectors 
as previously noted  gross unrealized losses were million at december   declining from billion a year earlier 
approximately of the decrease in net unrealized loss was attributable to improvements in valuations in non financial sectors since year end and was due to a partial recovery in the net unrealized loss position of our financial holdings 
as discussed in note investments  we believe much of the unrealized losses in recent periods were attributable to illiquidity in the financial markets 
we expect to recover the full book value of our investments in impaired securities 
as shown in the table above  the ratio of gross unrealized losses to book value was greater than for our investments in cdos and the financial guarantor mortgage insurer monoline insurer sectors 
we evaluated each of the impaired securities in these and all other sectors to determine whether or not any of 
table of contents the impairments were other than temporary 
certain information about our evaluation of the impaired securities in the cdo and monoline insurer sectors is provided in the following paragraphs 
at december   we held investments in five different cdos 
in our opinion  our investments in four of these cdos million amortized cost and million fair value were other than temporarily impaired and our investment in one cdo million amortized cost and million fair value was not other than temporarily impaired 
in reaching this conclusion  we reviewed and discussed with the collateral managers for each of these cdos the current status of the collateral underlying our investments  the credit events defaults and deferrals in underlying collateral experienced to date  and the possibility of future credit events 
we calculated expected future cash flows using assumptions for expected future credit events that reflect actual historical experience and expected future experience 
we reviewed the actual versus expected cash flows received to date and the impact that potential future credit events would have on our expected future cash flows 
we calculated the magnitude of future credit events that could be experienced without negatively impacting the recovery of our investment and our expected yield rate 
while there is a possibility that future credit events will exceed our current expectations  we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions 
also at december   we held investments issued by five different monoline insurers 
in our opinion  our investments in three of these monoline insurers million amortized cost and million fair value were other than temporarily impaired and our investments in two monoline insurers million amortized cost and million fair value were not other than temporarily impaired 
we collected and analyzed a significant amount of information to form opinions about the reasons for the severity of our impairments  including the illiquidity of some of our holdings and its impact on fair values  the expected future experience in the mortgage market  and the reasonable expectation of the receipt of all future contractual interest and principal payments for these investments 
we reviewed news and information about the economy and the mortgage market in general and about the issuers of our investments 
we reviewed and analyzed financial statements and had discussions with sell side and independent credit analysts who follow this sector  certain regulators  and members of the management teams of some of the issuers of our investments 
while there is a possibility that future experience in the mortgage markets will differ from our current expectations  we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions 
at december   our internal rating for a security was determined as the average of the security s rating from four nationally recognized rating agencies 
the ratings from each agency are evenly weighted when calculating the average  and the average is rounded to the nearest rating when it is between two ratings 
in prior years  the average was rounded down to the next lower rating when it was between two ratings 
the ratings methodology was changed in to more accurately reflect the average ratings of the securities and to make ratings by category be more consistent with the statutory ratings which are instrumental in determining the regulatory required capital for our insurance subsidiaries 
under the new rating methodology  below investment grade bonds would have been of the fixed maturity portfolio at december  at amortized cost  compared with based on the prior rating methodology 

table of contents an analysis of the fixed maturity portfolio by a composite rating at december  is shown in the table below 
fixed maturities by rating at december  dollar amounts in millions amortized cost fair value investment grade aaa aa a bbb bbb bbb investment grade below investment grade bb b below b below investment grade the portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of bbb based on amortized cost 
approximately of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade 
our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alt a mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower 
we have no direct investments in residential mortgages  nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts 
we do not participate in securities lending 
there are no off balance sheet investments  as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we had million at fair value million book value invested in cdos  for which the composite rating at that date was cc 
the collateral underlying these cdos is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies  but no sub prime or alt a mortgages are included in the collateral 
our current investment policy is to acquire only investment grade obligations 
thus  any increases in below investment grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

table of contents market risk sensitivity 
torchmark s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk  meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
since of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixed rate investments  the portfolio is highly subject to market risk 
declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value 
under normal market conditions  we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity 
the long term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio 
the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio 
however  in accordance with gaap  these liabilities are not marked to market 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in basis points at december  at december  realized gains and losses 
our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits  sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future 
in addition to the payment of these benefits  we also incur acquisition costs  administrative expenses  and taxes as a part of insurance operations 
because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods  premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations 
for this reason  we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations 
this portfolio consists primarily of high quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long term insurance product obligations 
as a result  fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities 
expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 
because our investment portfolio is large and diverse  investments are occasionally sold or called  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
these gains and losses occur only incidentally  usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers 
investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments 
we do not engage in trading investments for profit 
therefore  gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield  or which result from events that are beyond our control  are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations  and as a result  can have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period to period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations 
accordingly  they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations 
for these reasons  and in line with industry practice  we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 

table of contents the following table summarizes our tax effected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the three year period ended december  analysis of realized gains losses  net of tax dollar amounts in thousands  except for per share data year ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share fixed maturities and equities sales called or tendered writedowns real estate sales writedowns loss on redemption of debt other total written down due to other than temporary impairment 
as described in note investments under the caption other than temporary impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year through as a result of other than temporary impairment 
the impaired securities met our criteria for other than temporary impairment as discussed in note and in our critical accounting policies in this report 
the writedowns resulted in pretax charges of million in million after tax  million in million after tax  and million in million after tax 
the charge included million on cdos million after tax and million on monoline financial guarantors and mortgage insurers million after tax 
the remaining writedowns in were from losses on a variety of corporate bonds 
in  the significant bonds written down were lehman brothers bonds of million pretax million after tax and washington mutual bonds of million pretax million after tax 
other writedowns in included perpetual preferred stocks of federal national mortgage association and certain non financial securities 
impairment losses on fixed maturities in were related to non financial institution holdings 
additionally  as described in note  we wrote down a real estate investment to fair value in  resulting in a loss of million thousand after tax 
we wrote down an additional thousand thousand after tax in on this investment 

table of contents financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  a portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs 
sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
insurance subsidiary liquidity 
the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs 
sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
the funds to provide for policy benefits  the majority of which are paid in future periods  are invested primarily in long term fixed maturities to meet these long term obligations 
in addition to investment income  maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash 
excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company  subject to regulatory restriction 
the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries prior year earnings calculated on a statutory basis 
parent company liquidity 
an important source of cash flow to the parent company is dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries noted above 
these dividends are used to pay parent company dividends on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayments on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent 
in  million in dividends were paid to the parent company  as compared with million in and million in after paying debt obligations  shareholder dividends  and other expenses but before share repurchases  torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in of approximately million 
parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes  such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases 
in  it is expected that the parent company will receive million in dividends from subsidiaries and that approximately million will be available as excess cash flow 
certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends 
for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries  see the restrictions section of note shareholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 
an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
as of december   we had available million under this facility 
for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility  see the commercial paper section of note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the first half of until early june  torchmark qualified for and participated in the commercial paper funding facility cpff  a facility created by the federal reserve board to purchase commercial paper from eligible issuers 
one condition of participation was that we maintain our commercial paper credit ratings 
as of june   one agency downgraded our commercial paper facility by one notch 
as a result  we no longer qualified to issue commercial paper in the cpff after that date 
however  the company has been able to issue commercial paper in the public market since that time at a considerably lower cost than through the government program 
we issued over one billion dollars of commercial paper during the second half of at an average yield of  compared with an average yield of during the first half of which was primarily issued under the cpff 
the downgrade has not had an impact on our ability to access public commercial paper markets 
in summary  torchmark expects to have readily available funds for and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility 
in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed  the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including  but not limited to  the issuance of additional debt  a short term credit facility  and intercompany borrowing 

table of contents consolidated liquidity 
consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were million in  compared with million in  and million in in addition to cash inflows from operations  our companies have received million in investment calls and tenders and million of scheduled maturities or repayments during maturities  tenders  and calls totaled million in and billion in our cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end additionally  we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need 
these securities had a fair value of billion at december  however  our strong cash flows from operations  investment maturities  and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as fully described and discussed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt  torchmark had outstanding million par amount trust preferred securities at both december  and the capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders 
the trust is an off balance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules 
deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest 
therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity  even though we own all of the entity s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity s performance 
while these liabilities are not on our consolidated balance sheets  they are represented by torchmark s junior subordinated debentures due to the trust 
these junior subordinated debentures were a torchmark liability of million par and book value at both december  and these securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption capital resources in this report 
the preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our interest payment on our debt to the trusts 
as described in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 
as a part of its above mentioned credit facility  torchmark has outstanding million in stand by letters of credit 
however  these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole 
as of december   we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities other than as described above 
all of our guarantees  other than the trust preferred guarantee  were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries  as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies 

table of contents the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december  amounts in millions actual liability total payments less than one year one to three years four to five years more than five years fixed and determinable debt principal debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations uncertain tax positions future insurance obligations total funded debt is itemized in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and includes short term commercial paper 
interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations 
pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans 
they are offset by invested assets in the trusts  which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due 
therefore  our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on torchmark s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   these pension obligations were million  but there were also assets of million in the pension entities 
the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations  except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted 
please refer to note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations 
uncertain tax positions do not include thousand of accrued interest 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force and separate account obligations at december  these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown 
management believes that the assets supporting the liability of billion at december   along with future premiums and investment income  will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations 
capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of short term debt the commercial paper facility described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term funded debt  junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark s capital trust iii which is liable for its trust preferred securities 
in accordance with gaap  these instruments are included in due to affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
a complete analysis and description of long term debt issues outstanding is presented in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
our senior debentures matured and were repaid in august  at a redemption amount of million plus accrued interest 
at year end  they were classified as short term debt because they were due within a year 
as a result  reported long term debt at december  was million 
as fully explained in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  in june of we issued million principal amount of senior notes due in for proceeds of million 
as noted above  a portion of these proceeds were used to repay the million due upon the august  maturity of our senior debentures 
of the million balance of the proceeds  million was contributed to our insurance subsidiaries in the subsidiaries then in turn invested these funds in investment grade corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
the capital contributions were made as a result of our desire to maintain subsidiary regulatory capital at levels adequate to meet the requirements of rating agencies 
poor economic conditions experienced during caused the ratings of many bonds in our insurance subsidiaries portfolios to be downgraded and have also resulted in increased other than 
table of contents temporary impairments taken 
because of the large volume of ratings downgrades and impairments  these items have had a significant negative effect on the subsidiaries regulatory capital 
the subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least of required regulatory capital under risk based capital rbc  a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital 
the target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows  the relatively low risk of their product mix  and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark 
rbc has been favorably impacted by these capital contributions and the sales of below investment grade securities discussed under the caption investments sales transactions in this report 
at december   our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios in excess of 
should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future and the ratio falls below  management could utilize cash on hand at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 
due to its strong liquidity and capital position  torchmark has no intent at this point in time to issue equity  and  in fact  has recently declared an increase in its dividend on it common stock from 
to 
per share each quarter 
as noted under the caption highlights in this report  we suspended our share repurchase program indefinitely in march  due to general economic conditions at that time 
reactivation of this program is subject to board approval 
no share purchases have been made since march  however  we did acquire million shares at a cost of million per share in the first quarter of under the program 
share purchases in and were more significant  as we acquired million shares for million in and million shares in for million under the program 
please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption highlights in this report 
shareholders equity was billion at december   compared with billion at december  during the twelve months since december   shareholders equity was reduced by the million in share purchases but has been increased by a reduction of million of net unrealized losses after tax in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved 
as explained in note investments unrealized loss analysis  unrealized losses in and early have resulted primarily from illiquidity in the financial markets in recent periods as a result of general economic conditions 
we plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future but we will be cautious in doing so 
excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases  acquisitions  increases in shareholder dividends  investment in fixed maturities  or repayment of short term debt 
we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies 
as mentioned previously  our share repurchase program was suspended in the first quarter of due to general economic conditions at the time 
the program could be resumed with approval by the board of directors if share repurchases are determined to be the best use of excess cash 
historically  management has felt that share purchases have been beneficial to the company 
we believe that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings and to return on equity  and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value 
as noted earlier in this report  we acquired over million shares at a cost of million in with excess cash flow 
in  a much more significant purchase of million shares at a cost of million was made 
in  if the free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds  an estimated million of additional investment income  after tax  would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have declined to 
because share purchases were made  actual net income per share was  a lesser decline of 
the majority of purchased shares are retired each year 
we maintain a significant available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities 
current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
the period to period changes in fair value  net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets 
while invested assets are revalued  accounting rules do not permit interest bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as assets  with changes in value applied directly to shareholders equity 
due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our 
table of contents shareholders equity  this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders equity 
if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets  the effect on equity would be largely offset 
fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period to period presentation of our shareholders equity  capital structure  and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets 
more recently  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio has been depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity resulting in a significant decrease in shareholders equity 
because of the long term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries  we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity 
as such  we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets 
accordingly  our management  credit rating agencies  lenders  many industry analysts  and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet  capital structure  and financial ratios 
the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources 
additionally  the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items  so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark s capital structure 
selected financial data at december  at december  at december  gaap effect of accounting rule requiring revaluation gaap effect of accounting rule requiring revaluation gaap effect of accounting rule requiring revaluation fixed maturities millions deferred acquisition costs millions total assets millions short term debt millions long term debt millions shareholders equity millions book value per diluted share debt to capitalization diluted shares outstanding thousands actual shares outstanding thousands amount added to deducted from comprehensive income to produce the stated gaap item includes torchmark s junior subordinated debentures in   and in the amount of million 
torchmark s debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting rule requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio 
effective in  the fasb issued new guidance  offering an option which  if elected  would permit us to value our interest bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our available for sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income  the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings 
because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt  the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile  causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results 
therefore  we have not elected this option 
as discussed earlier in this report  the fixed maturity portfolio incurred billion in net unrealized investment losses in billion after tax and adjustments of deferred acquisition costs 
these unrealized losses are believed by management to have been brought on by widening credit spreads in financial markets  and were the primary factor in the decline in our shareholders equity in in  as conditions in financial markets have begun to improve  unrealized losses have declined billion

torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was times in  compared with times in and times in a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 
credit ratings 
the credit quality of torchmark s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies 
in  moody s affirmed our credit ratings 
in  however  they modified their outlook on our senior debt from stable to negative 
they cited their expectation of rising asset losses as well as tighter liquidity and reduced financial flexibility 
in  standard poor s affirmed all credit ratings on torchmark and its subsidiaries 
however  it revised its outlook to negative from stable for the company 
standard poor s cited our increased risk within our investment portfolio which had experienced significant unrealized losses concentrated in the financial sector 
they also noted that our share repurchase program has reduced our capitalization  but that we were still well within a level adequate to support their rating 
during  standard poor s lowered its credit rating on torchmark s outstanding debt from a to a  and lowered the rating of its preferred stock from a to bbb 
the credit rating change was attributed to weaker agent productivity  recruiting  and retention  as well as changes in direct response strategy  all of which have contributed to lower new sales 
during  am best affirmed our funded debt rating at a  but downgraded our preferred stock from bbb to bbb 
they also revised their outlook to negative on the funded debt 
also in  fitch downgraded our senior debt from a to bbb two notches  our preferred stock from a to bbb two notches  and our commercial paper from f to f one notch 
fitch stated that the downgrades were a result of the weakness in the statutory capital position of torchmark s insurance subsidiaries brought on by the ratings downgrades of fixed maturity securities held in the subsidiaries investment portfolios 
they also expressed concern with the level of intercompany financing by the parent company from the subsidiaries  the ongoing exposure to financial market turmoil  and the expectation of continued investment deterioration going forward 
fitch had previously revised its outlook to negative from stable in and maintained the negative outlook in the chart below presents torchmark s credit ratings as of december  standard poor s fitch moody s am best commercial paper a f p amb funded debt a bbb baa a preferred stock bbb bbb baa bbb in january   fitch further downgraded our preferred stock one notch to bbb 
at that time  fitch downgraded over hybrid securities issued by insurance industry entities  as their assessments of these securities in our industry changed 
the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by standard poor s and am best 
in  am best affirmed the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 
in  standard poor s lowered its financial strength rating of united investors to a from a and the ratings of liberty  globe  united american and american income from aa to aa  as a result of an expected lag in new business sales in the short term 
the following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at december  standard poor s am best liberty aa a superior globe aa a superior united investors a a excellent united american aa a superior american income aa a superior am best states that it assigns a superior ratings to those companies which  in its opinion  have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life health insurance industry 
a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
the am best a excellent rating is assigned to those companies which  in its opinion  have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the life health insurance industry 
a excellent companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 

table of contents the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard poor s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics  differing only slightly from those rated higher 
the minus sign shows the relative standing within the major rating category 
the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics  somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings 
transactions with related parties information regarding related party transactions is found in note related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries 
such punitive damage claims that are tried in alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material 
for more information concerning litigation  please refer to note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
new unadopted accounting rules the fasb has issued new accounting guidance potentially applicable to torchmark  effective in future periods transfers of financial assets this guidance  effective for torchmark as of january   amends previous guidance concerning transfers of financial assets to disallow the use of qualifying special purpose entities 
such entities are required to be evaluated for consolidation 
torchmark has no such entities and does not expect any impact from adoption 
variable interest entities this new guidance  effective for torchmark as of january   amends previous guidance concerning variable interest entities  modifying the determination of the primary beneficiary  and requiring ongoing assessment of primary beneficiary status of the variable interest entity for consolidation purposes 
at present  the adoption of this guidance will have no effect on torchmark 
while the trust that holds torchmark s trust preferred securities is a variable interest entity  and torchmark has voting control  torchmark is not the primary beneficiary 
therefore  we will not consolidate the trust under the new guidance  following the same treatment as in current practice 
fair value disclosures new guidance has been issued concerning disclosures about the fair value of financial assets 
this guidance will require us to separately disclose transfers in and out of level and level in the fair value hierarchy as we currently only disclose transfers in and out of level the point at which the transfer is recognized must be disclosed 
all purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements of level assets must be reported on a gross basis  contrary to our previous permitted practice of reporting on a net basis 
a more detailed disclosure of classes of investments will be required  although torchmark currently complies with the required level of detail 
valuation techniques for level and level assets must be fully disclosed 
the new guidance will be effective for torchmark beginning january   except for the detail breakout gross up of level assets which is effective beginning january  prior period comparisons are not required in the initial adoption periods 
early adoption is permitted 

table of contents critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry 
the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefit reserves 
approximately of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december  were traditional insurance liabilities whereby the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits 
the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue 
these assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts  except where there is a premium deficiency  as defined in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits 
otherwise  variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies 
a premium deficiency event for torchmark s traditional business is very rare  and did not occur during the three years ended december  the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business  whereby the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date 
accordingly  there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 
deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption value of insurance purchased as indicated in note deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december  were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums 
the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue 
these assumptions are locked in at that time and  except where there is a loss recognition issue  are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts 
absent a premium deficiency  variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume 
we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december  the remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits 
these contracts are not subject to lock in 
the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
with the exception of variable annuities  as discussed earlier in this report  revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december  the variable annuity block could sustain further increases in the level of amortization if equity markets were to decline 
amortization for deposit business is not expected to have a material impact on operations for the foreseeable future 
policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us 
however  the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns 
factors involved include the litigation environment  regulatory mandates  and the introduction of 
table of contents policy types for which claim patterns are not well established  and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims 
changes in these estimates  if any  are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made 
we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  are the most appropriate under the circumstances 
however  there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation 
at this time  we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 
revenue recognition 
premium income from our subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is due 
however  in accordance with gaap  revenues on limited payment contracts and universal life type contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently 
revenues on limited payment contracts are recognized over the contract period 
premium for deposit balance products  such as our annuity and interest sensitive life policies  is added to the policy account value 
the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability 
this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance  administration  surrender  and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder 
in each case  benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 
we report investment income as revenue  less investment expenses  when it is earned 
our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations 
because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future  the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested 
anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates  contract liabilities  and other product contract features 
these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products 
for more information concerning revenue recognition  investment accounting  and interest sensitivity  please refer to note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities  investments  and market risk sensitivity in this report 
valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in high quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time 
while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity  they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time  primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards 
we report this portfolio at fair value 
fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction 
the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets  having a greater impact on longer term maturities 
because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio  small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company 
this impact is disclosed in basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report 
however  as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report  we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and  as such  we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 
during recent periods  the values of our fixed maturities have also been affected by illiquidity in the financial markets  which has contributed to a spread widening  and accordingly unrealized losses  on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable 
even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale  we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products 
considerable information concerning the policies  procedures  classification levels  and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note investments under the caption fair value measurements 
impairment of investments 
we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value  where fair value has declined below carrying value 
while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary 
the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the 
table of contents captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other than temporary impairment  it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are offset  at least in part  by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
at december   our net liability under these plans was million 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans 
while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected 
our discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised  if necessary  based on more current information available to us 
note also contains information about pension plan assets  investment policies  and other related data
