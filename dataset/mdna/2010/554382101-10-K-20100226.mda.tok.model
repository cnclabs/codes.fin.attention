redevelopment and development activity northgate mall  the company s  square foot regional mall in marin county  california  opened the first phase of its redevelopment on november  new anchor kohl s was joined by retailers h m  bj s restaurant  children s place  chipotle  gymboree  hot topic  pacsun  panera bread  see s candies  sunglass hut  tilly s and vans 
as of december   the company incurred approximately million of redevelopment costs for this center and is estimating it will incur approximately million of additional costs in santa monica place in santa monica  california  is scheduled to open in august with anchors bloomingdale s and nordstrom 
the company recently announced deals with tony burch  ben bridge jewelers and charles david 
as of december   the company incurred approximately million of redevelopment costs for this center and is estimating it will incur approximately million of additional costs in inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the consumer price index cpi 
in addition  about of the leases expire each year  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  historically the majority of the leases required the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
in january  the company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses  generally excluding property taxes  regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center 
this change shifts the burden of cost control to the company 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectible accounts  impairment of long lived assets  the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets  and estimates for environmental matters 
the company s significant accounting policies are described 
table of contents in more detail in note summary of significant accounting policies in the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following policies are deemed to be critical 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the straight line rent adjustment 
currently  of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
percentage rents are recognized when the tenants specified sales targets have been met 
estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
property the company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment and development of properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited 
the company considers a construction project as completed and held available for occupancy and ceases capitalization of costs when the areas under development have been substantially completed 
maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
costs for major replacements and betterments  which includes hvac equipment  roofs  parking lots  etc  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings 
property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years tenant improvements years equipment and furnishings years accounting for acquisitions the company first determines the value of land and buildings utilizing an as if vacant methodology 
the company then assigns a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition 
the balance of the purchase price is allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities 
tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms 
the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms 
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in place operating leases which come in three forms i leasing commissions and legal costs  which represent the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in place leases  such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the company s markets  ii value of in place leases  which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the 
table of contents occupancy level when purchased  and iii above or below market value of in place leases  which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition  discounted for tenant credit risks 
leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms 
the value of in place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases 
above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities  depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market  and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases 
asset impairment the company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such factors include the tenant s ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases 
the company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment 
such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center 
the company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other than temporary 
the investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically  and as deemed necessary  for recoverability and valuation declines that are other than temporary 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions 
level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
the company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments 
when the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value  no additional disclosure is made 
deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight line method 
costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are 
table of contents deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
in place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of the renewal term 
leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the individual remaining lease years 
the ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows deferred lease costs years deferred financing costs years in place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal leasing commissions and legal costs years results of operations many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the transactions described above including the acquisition property  the joint venture centers  the mervyn s properties and the redevelopment centers

for the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december   the redevelopment centers include the oaks  northgate mall  santa monica place  shoppingtown mall  westside pavilion  the marketplace at flagstaff  santan village regional center and promenade at casa grande 
the us economy  the real estate industry as a whole  and the local markets in which the centers are located have in recent years experienced adverse economic conditions  resulting in an economic recession as well as disruptions in the capital and credit markets 
these difficult economic conditions have adversely impacted consumer spending levels and the operating results of the company s tenants 
regional mall sales per square foot for declined by approximately from to a level of per square foot  continuing the downward trend that began in regional mall portfolio occupancy also has declined since  with occupancy at december  at compared to at december  the company s ability to lease space and negotiate rents at advantageous rates has been  and may continue to be  adversely affected in this type of economic environment  and more tenants may seek rent relief 
the spread between rents on executed leases and expiring leases remains positive but decreased in compared to while the company cannot predict how long these adverse conditions will continue  a further continuation could harm the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

the decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures is due to the receipt of the company s pro rata share of loan proceeds from the refinance transactions at various unconsolidated joint ventures in financing activities cash flow provided by financing activities decreased from million in to million in the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributed to the issuance of million of senior notes in  the repurchase of million of senior notes in see liquidity and capital resources and the purchase of the capped calls in connection with the issuance of the senior notes in liquidity and capital resources the company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses and debt service and dividend requirements through cash generated from operations  working capital reserves and or borrowings under its unsecured line of credit

the company expects to incur between million and million in for development  redevelopment  expansion and renovations 
capital for these major expenditures  developments and or redevelopments has been  and is expected to continue to be  obtained from a combination of equity or debt financings  which include borrowings under the company s line of credit and construction loans 
in addition  the company has generated additional liquidity in the past through joint venture transactions and the sale of non core assets  and may continue to do so in the future  as evidenced by the non core asset sales in and the recent sale of ownership interests in queens center  flatiron crossing  freehold raceway mall and chandler fashion center  to joint venture partners 
recent turmoil in the capital and credit markets  however  has significantly limited access to debt and equity financing for many companies 
as demonstrated by the company s recent activity  including its october equity offering  the company was able to access capital throughout  however  there is no assurance the company will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions 
many factors impact the company s ability to access capital  such as its overall debt level  interest rates  interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions 
as a result of the current state of the capital and commercial lending markets  the company may be required to finance more of its business activities with borrowings under its line of credit rather than with public and private unsecured debt and equity securities  fixed rate mortgage financing and other traditional sources 
in addition  in the event that the company has significant tenant defaults as a result of the overall economy and general market conditions  the company could have a decrease in cash flow from operations  which could create further borrowings under its line of credit 
these events could result in an increase in the company s proportion of variable rate debt  which would cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future

table of contents funds from operations the company uses ffo in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers ffo and ffo diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to gaap measures 
nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company also adjusts ffo for the noncontrolling interest due to redemption value on the rochester properties 
see note discontinued operations in the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
ffo and ffo on a fully diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods 
this is especially true since ffo excludes real estate depreciation and amortization as the company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight line basis over time 
in addition  consistent with the key objective of ffo as a measure of operating performance  the adjustment of ffo for the noncontrolling interest in redemption value provides a more meaningful measure of the company s operating performance between periods without reference to the non cash charge related to the adjustment in noncontrolling interest due to redemption value 
the company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other reits 
further  ffo on a fully diluted basis is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
the company also cautions that ffo  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
the reconciliation of ffo and ffo diluted to net income available to common stockholders is provided below 
management compensates for the limitations of ffo by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to gaap  along with this detailed discussion of ffo and a reconciliation of ffo and ffo diluted to net income available to common stockholders 
management believes that to further understand the company s performance  ffo should be compared with the company s reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with gaap  as presented in the company s consolidated financial statements

the computation of ffo diluted shares outstanding includes the effect of share and unit based compensation plans and the senior notes using the treasury stock method 
it also assumes the conversion of macwh  lp common and preferred units to the extent that they are dilutive to the ffo computation
