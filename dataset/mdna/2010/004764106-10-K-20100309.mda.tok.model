our headquarters is located in burlington  massachusetts and we plan to relocate to bedford  massachusetts in june we maintain sales offices in madrid  spain  seoul  korea  tokyo  japan  and ipswich  united kingdom 
we also have sales personnel in argentina  australia  belgium  brazil  canada  china  croatia  czech republic  france  germany  hong kong  india  italy  jordan  malaysia  mexico  the netherlands  new zealand  peru  poland  russia  singapore  south africa  sweden  taiwan  and thailand and throughout the united states 
we expect to selectively add personnel to provide additional geographic sales and technical support coverage 
business combination on april   we acquired covergence inc  or covergence  an emerging  innovative provider of software based session border controllers for delivering voip ip telephony  unified communications and service oriented architecture applications within global enterprises 
the aggregate purchase price was million  consisting of  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million   in cash payments to the stockholders of covergence and the payment of withholding taxes due for the former chief executive officer of covergence  of approximately  we also incurred approximately  of fees associated with the registration of the common stock issued  which has been recorded as a reduction to the purchase price 
the transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of covergence have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction have been recognized at their acquisition date fair values which have been finalized at december  the acquisition of covergence was deemed a bargain purchase for accounting purposes and a gain of million was recorded in other income in our consolidated statement of income in we also incurred million of merger and integration related costs associated with our acquisition of covergence which we recorded as an expense in our consolidated statement of income during industry background service providers traditionally have delivered voice and data services over two separate networks the public switched telephone network  or pstn  and the internet 
the pstn provides high reliability and security but is costly to operate and is limited in its ability to support high bandwidth video and other interactive multimedia services 
the internet is capable of cost effectively transmitting any form of traffic that is internet protocol  or ip  based  including interactive voice  video and data  but it transmits only on a best efforts basis  because all forms of traffic have the same priority 
therefore  the internet attempts to deliver all traffic without distinction  which can result in significantly varying degrees of service quality for the same or similar types of traffic transmissions 
internet based services are also subject to disruptive and fraudulent behavior  including identity theft  viruses  unwanted and excessively large input data  known as spam  and the unauthorized use and attempts to circumvent or bypass security mechanisms associated with those services  known as hacking 
service providers are migrating to a single ip network architecture to serve as the foundation for their next generation voice  video and data service offerings 
during the last two years  an increasing number of enterprises  contact centers and government agencies have begun to migrate to a single ip network architecture as well 
in order to provide secure and high quality interactive communications on a converged ip network  service providers and enterprises must be able to manage and integrate the communications flows that comprise communication sessions for applications such as interactive video and voip  which allows the routing of voice conversations over the internet 

table of contents prior to the advent of the sbc  ip network infrastructure equipment  such as softswitches  routers and data firewalls  was able to initiate and route undifferentiated data but lacked the ability to target specifically the management of interactive communication sessions 
we believe that there is significant demand for sbcs that can facilitate the delivery of secure and high quality real time interactive communications across all ip network borders 
infonetics research  a market research and consulting firm specializing in networking and ip communications  projects that the cumulative worldwide addressable market opportunity for sbcs over the next four years from to will be million and million in the service provider and enterprise markets  respectively 
we see emerging opportunities for our solutions within large enterprises  contact centers  government agencies and wireless service providers 
we believe that enterprise ip telephony  or ipt  is now mainstream  and that unified communications  or uc  or the integration of interactive voice  video  messaging and collaboration applications over ip  will soon follow 
both are critical components of enterprise information technology strategies to improve business agility  increase employee efficiency and responsiveness  build customer satisfaction and loyalty  and reduce overhead costs 
we believe that these components are indispensable tools for success in a newly competitive global marketplace 
the full scale deployment of enterprise ipt has revealed deficiencies in network and security infrastructure originally deployed for data 
consequently  we believe that enterprises will likely be adding further controls to their ipt uc infrastructure to improve its security  extend its application reach  meet service level commitments  optimize capital and minimize operating costs  and comply with relevant commercial and government regulations 
enterprises are deploying sbcs to successfully deliver network security  availability  and performance as well as to achieve control over the four key borders within their ipt uc infrastructure  ip trunking  private network  internet  and hosted services interconnect borders 
we believe that the majority of large enterprises today having already deployed ip private branch exchanges  or ippbxs are about to rapidly embrace sip trunking to reduce costs and set the foundation for enabling end to end ip communication 
within today s modern contact center  the migration of voice services from time division multiplexing  or tdm  to ip is underway 
this migration is essential to the contact center s strategic goals meeting customers growing service expectations  achieving increased performance and quality metrics  improving agent retention rates  growing revenues and reducing capital and operating costs 
however  existing network and security infrastructure that was originally deployed for tdm voice services and data applications have demonstrated deficiencies for ip interactive communications 
we believe that contact center strategists are deploying sbcs to assert control over the four critical ip network borders found in most contact centers its connections to ip trunking service providers  to managed private ip networks  to the public internet  and to virtual contact center locations 
with sbcs to reinforce these borders in five key functional areas  security  application reach  service level agreement assurance  cost optimization  and regulatory compliance  contact centers can successfully and safely navigate the transition to an ip infrastructure 
our early customers within this market have included the contact center operations of our tier service providers throughout north america  europe  asia  as well as central and latin america 
key financial highlights key financial highlights for include the following total revenue was million for compared to million in  net income was million for compared to million in net income was per share on a diluted basis for compared to per share on a diluted basis in  and cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million in 
table of contents the acme packet strategy principal elements of our strategy include continuing to satisfy the evolving border requirements of large service providers  enterprises  government agencies and contact centers 
our sbc deployments in the wireline  wireless and cable networks of tier and other large service providers  as well as in enterprises and contact centers  position us to gain valuable knowledge that we can use to expand and enhance our products features and functionality 
exploiting new technologies to enhance product performance and scalability 
we will seek to leverage new technologies as they become available to increase the performance  capacity and functionality of our product family  as well as to reduce our costs 
we may acquire these new technologies through organic growth or through selective acquisitions 
investing in quality and responsive support 
as we broaden our product platform and increase our product capabilities  we will continue to provide comprehensive service and support targeted at maximizing customer satisfaction and retention 
facilitating and promoting service interconnects among our customers 
we intend to increase demand for our products by helping our customers to extend the reach of their services and  consequently  to increase the value of their services to their customers 
leveraging distribution partnerships to enhance market penetration 
we will continue to invest in training and tools for our distribution partners sales  systems engineering and support organizations  in order to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of these partnerships 
actively contributing to architecture and standards definition processes 
we will utilize our breadth and depth of experience with sbc deployments to contribute significantly to organizations developing standards and architectures for next generation ip networks 
factors that may affect future performance global macroeconomic conditions 
we believe that the capital budgets and spending initiatives of some of our core customers  service providers  enterprises  government agencies and contact centers  may be affected by current worldwide economic conditions 
our ability to generate revenue from these core customers is dependent on the status of such capital budgets 
gross margin 
our gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our products and services  b the average selling price of our products  which in turn depends  in part  on the mix of product and product configurations sold  c the level of software license upgrades  d new product introductions  e the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  and f the costs of manufacturing our hardware products and the provision of our related support services 
customers license our software in various configurations depending on each customer s requirements for session capacity  feature groups and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of the system sold 
systems with higher software content higher session capacity and a larger number of feature groups will generally have a higher average selling price than those systems sold with lower software content 
if customers begin to purchase systems with lower software content  this may have a negative impact on our gross margins 
competition 
the market for sbcs is competitive and constantly evolving 
while we believe we are currently the market leader in the service provider and enterprise market  we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future as the sbc market grows 
our primary competitors generally consist of start up vendors  such as genband inc  and more established network and component companies such as cisco systems  inc and huawei technologies co  ltd 
we also compete with some of the companies with which we have distribution partnerships  such as sonus networks inc  telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson  and alcatel lucent 
we believe 
table of contents we compete successfully with all of these companies based upon our experience in interactive communications networks  the breadth of our applications and standards support  the depth of our border control features  the demonstrated ability of our products to interoperate with key communications infrastructure elements  and our comprehensive service and support 
we also believe our products are priced competitively with our competitors offerings 
as the sbc market opportunity grows  we expect competition from additional networking and ip communications equipment suppliers  including our distribution partners 
evolution of the sbc market 
the market for sbcs is in its early stages and is still evolving  and it is uncertain whether these products will continue to achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
our success will depend  to a substantial extent  on the willingness of interactive communications service providers and enterprises to continue to implement sbcs 
research and development 
to continue to achieve market acceptance for our products  we must effectively anticipate and adapt  in a timely manner  to customer requirements and must offer products that meet changing customer demands 
prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that our current products do not have 
the market for sbcs is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry requirements 
we intend to continue to invest in our research and development efforts  which we believe are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
managing growth 
we significantly expanded our operations in and during the period from december  through december  we increased the number of our employees and full time independent contractors by  from to in connection with the acquisition of covergence in april  we added employees 
we anticipate that further expansion of our infrastructure and headcount will be required to achieve planned expansion of our product offerings  projected increases in our customer base and anticipated growth in the number of product deployments 
in the future  we expect to continue to carefully manage the increase of our operating expenses based on our ability to expand our revenues  the expansion of which could occur organically or through future acquisitions 
revenue we derive product revenue from the sale of our net net hardware and the licensing of our net net software 
we generally recognize product revenue at the time of product delivery  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for arrangements that include customer acceptance or other material non standard terms  we defer revenue recognition until after delivery  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we generate maintenance  support and service revenue from a maintenance associated with software licenses  b technical support services for our product software  c hardware repair and maintenance services  d implementation  training and consulting services and e reimbursable travel and other out of pocket expenses 
we offer our products and services indirectly through distribution partners and directly through our sales force 
our distribution partners include networking and telecommunications equipment vendors throughout the world 
our distribution partners generally purchase our products after they have received a purchase order from their customers and  generally  do not maintain an inventory of our products in anticipation of sales to their customers 
generally  the pricing offered to our distribution partners will be lower than to our direct customers 
the product configuration  which reflects the mix of session capacity and requested features  determines the price for each sbc sold 
customers can purchase our sbcs in either a standalone or high availability configuration and can license our software in various configurations  depending on the customers requirements for session capacity  feature groups and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of the system sold 
as the market continues to develop and grow  we expect to experience increased price pressure on our products and services 

table of contents we believe that our revenue and results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of long sales and deployment cycles  variations in customer ordering patterns  and the application of complex revenue recognition rules to certain transactions 
some of our arrangements with customers include clauses under which we may be subject to penalties for failure to meet specified performance obligations 
we have not incurred any such penalties to date 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue consists primarily of a third party manufacturers fees for purchased materials and services  combined with company expenses for b salaries  wages and related benefits for our manufacturing personnel  c related overhead  d provision for inventory obsolescence  e amortization of intangible assets and f stock based compensation 
amortization of intangible assets represents the amortization of developed technologies from our acquisition of covergence 
cost of maintenance  support and service revenue consists primarily of a salaries  wages and related benefits for our support and service personnel b related overhead  c billable and non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket expenses  d contract services for repairs and warranty services and e stock based compensation 
gross profit our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our products and services  b the average selling price of our products  which in turn depends  in part  on the mix of product and product configurations sold  c the mix between product and service revenue  d new product introductions  e the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  f the volume and costs of manufacturing of our hardware products and g personnel and related costs for manufacturing  support and services 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
during the period from december  through december   we increased the number of our employees and full time independent contractors by  from to  including the employees we added through the acquisition of covergence in april we expect to continue to hire new employees to support our expected growth 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  b commissions  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  d marketing programs such as trade shows  e stock based compensation and f other related overhead 
commissions are recorded as expense when earned by the employee 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales force to continue to increase our revenue and market share 
however  we anticipate that sales and marketing expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
research and development expense consists primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  b payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  c prototype and equipment costs relating to the design and development of new products and enhancement of existing products  d quality assurance and testing  e stock based compensation and f other related overhead 
to date  all of the costs related to our research and development efforts have been expensed as incurred 
we intend to continue to invest in our research and development efforts  which we believe are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars 
however  we anticipate that research and development expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of a salaries  wages and personnel costs related to our executive  finance  human resource and information technology organizations  
table of contents b accounting and legal professional fees  c expenses associated with uncollectible accounts  d stock based compensation and e other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in infrastructure to support continued growth and incur ongoing expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including increased audit and legal fees  costs of compliance with securities and other regulations  investor relations expense  and higher insurance premiums 
however  we anticipate that general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
merger and integration related expenses primarily consist of transaction expenses and severance related charges relating to employees of covergence who were separated from employment as a result of our acquisition of covergence 
stock based compensation cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock based compensation expense 
we expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expense of million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards 
based on share based awards granted from through  a future expense of non vested options of million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in july  our board of directors approved an offer  referred to as the offer  to our employees  excluding members of our board of directors and our section officers  to exchange option grants that had i an exercise price greater than or equal to the higher of a and b a price at least higher than the closing price of our common stock on the expiration date of the offer  ii were granted under the acme packet  inc equity incentive plan  and iii were held by eligible option holders 
eligible participants were all persons who were employees including employees on an expatriate assignment hired on or before pm  eastern daylight savings time  on july  and who remained employees through the date on which the new options were granted  and included certain independent contractors who continued to provide services to us through the date on which the new options granted 
the offer expired on august   and upon the expiration  we exchanged the tendered options that had exercise prices equal to or greater than per share for new options 
the tendered options that were exchanged for new option were cancelled on the expiration date of the offer 
as a result  an aggregate of  options  with exercise prices ranging from to per share  were cancelled and exchanged for  options with an exercise price per share of 
the new options began to vest on the new option grant date  whereby of the new options vest on the first anniversary of the new option grant date  and the remainder vesting ratably on a quarterly basis over the final three years of the vesting period 
on the date of the exchange  the estimated fair value of the new options did not exceed the estimated fair value of the exchanged stock options calculated immediately prior to the exchange 
as such  there was no incremental stock based compensation expense associated with the new options  and we did not record additional compensation expense related to the exchange 
we will continue to recognize the remaining compensation expense related to the exchanged options over the vesting period of the new options 
other income expense  net other income expense consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalent and investments 
we historically have invested cash primarily in high quality securities of a short duration and are not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
other income expense also includes losses gains from foreign currency translation adjustments of our international subsidiaries 
the functional currency of our international operations in europe and asia is the us dollar 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these international subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  or historical rate  as appropriate 
revenue and expenses of these international subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars at the average rates in effect during the period 
any differences resulting from the re measurement of assets  liabilities and 
table of contents operations of the european and asian subsidiaries are recorded within other income expense 
lastly  for the year ended december   other income expense includes a gain we recognized related to the acquisition of covergence in april resulting from the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeding the aggregate purchase price 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report on form k 
we believe that some of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the accounting standard addressing software revenue recognition  as we have determined that the software element of our product is more than incidental to our products as a whole 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related accounts receivable is deemed probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by the customer and us to be representative of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when product has been delivered to the customer and no significant post delivery obligations exist 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
certain of our agreements contain products that might not conform to published specifications or contain a requirement to deliver additional elements which are essential to the functionality of the delivered element 
revenue associated with these agreements is recognized when the customer specifications have been met or delivery of the additional elements has occurred 
fees are fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenue when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms exceed our normal terms  we recognize revenue as the amounts become due and payable or upon the receipt of cash 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue is deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 

table of contents a substantial percentage of our sales involve multiple element arrangements  such as products  maintenance  professional services and training 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we allocate the total fee among the various elements using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the arrangement 
each arrangement requires us to analyze the individual elements in the transaction and to estimate the fair value of each undelivered element  which typically represents maintenance and services 
revenue is allocated to each of the undelivered elements based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
maintenance  support and services revenue include sales of maintenance and other services  including professional services  training and reimbursable travel 
maintenance and support services include telephone support  return and repair services  and unspecified rights to product upgrades and enhancements  and are recognized ratably over the term of the service period  which is generally twelve months 
maintenance and support revenue is generally deferred until the related product has been accepted and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
professional services and training revenue is recognized as the related service is performed 
our products and services are sold indirectly through distribution partners and directly by our sales force 
revenue generated through arrangements with distribution partners is recognized when the above criteria are met and only when the distribution partner has an order from an end user customer 
we typically do not offer contractual rights of return  stock balancing or price protection to our distribution partners  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
as a result  we do not maintain reserves for product returns and related allowances 
allowance for doubtful accounts we offset gross trade accounts receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis  and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
if our historical collection experience does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables  our future provision for doubtful accounts could be materially affected 
to date  we have not incurred any significant write offs of accounts receivable and have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
stock based compensation for stock options issued under our stock based compensation plans  the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  and an estimated forfeiture rate is used when calculating stock based compensation expense for the period 
for restricted stock awards and units issued under our stock based compensation plans  the fair value of each grant is calculated based on our stock price on the date of grant and an estimated forfeiture rate is used when calculating stock based compensation expense for the period 
we recognize the compensation cost of stock based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation are reported as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in the statements of cash flows 
this requirement reduces net operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows in certain periods 

table of contents as there was no public market for our common stock prior to october   we determined the volatility for options granted in based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies as well as the historical volatility of our common stock beginning in january the expected life of options has been determined utilizing the simplified method as prescribed by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
the risk free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
in addition  as discussed above  we utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period 
we have applied estimated forfeiture rates derived from an analysis of historical data of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  in determining the expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
inventory we recognize inventory losses based on obsolescence and levels in excess of forecasted demand 
in these cases  inventory is written down to its estimated realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technical obsolescence of our products 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in the cost of revenue in the period the revision is made 
to date  we have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our inventory valuations 
when products have been delivered  but the product revenue associated with the arrangement has been deferred as a result of not meeting the revenue recognition criteria  we also defer the related inventory costs for the delivered items and classify these items as deferred product costs 
product warranties substantially all of our products are covered by a standard warranty of ninety days for software and one year for hardware 
in the event of a failure of hardware or software covered by this warranty  we must repair or replace the hardware or software or  if those remedies are insufficient  and at our discretion  provide a refund 
our customers typically purchase maintenance and support contracts  which encompass our warranty obligations 
our warranty reserve reflects estimated material and labor costs for potential or actual product issues in our installed base that are not covered under maintenance contracts  but for which we expect to incur an obligation 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts 
we periodically assess the adequacy of the warranty allowance and adjust the amount as necessary 
during the years ended december  and we decreased our warranty allowance by  and  respectively  as a result of an analysis performed on historical data 
if the historical data we use to calculate the adequacy of the warranty allowance is not indicative of future requirements  additional or reduced warranty reserves may be required 
some of our arrangements with customers include clauses whereby we may be subject to penalties for failure to meet certain performance obligations 
we have not incurred any such penalties to date 

table of contents research and development expense for software products research and development expense includes costs incurred to develop intellectual property 
the costs for the development of new software and substantial enhancements to existing software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized 
we have determined that technological feasibility is established at the time a working model of software is completed 
because we believe our current process for developing software will be essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  no costs have been capitalized to date 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and international jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
this process requires us to project our current tax liability and estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities  including net operating loss  or nol  and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered our recent operating results  future taxable income projections and feasible tax planning strategies 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  as it applied to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
at the adoption date and as of december   and  we had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to liabilities  retained earnings or operations were required 
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
if the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds our purchase price  the excess is recognized currently as a gain 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
we have used the excess earnings method to value the acquired intangible assets related to developed technology  customer relationships and in process research and development 
this method is an income approach that identifies the future cash flows specifically related to the individual assets 
the trademarks and patents were valued via a relief from royalty method 
this method identifies similar licensing transactions for trademarks and patents and then applies those rates to the acquired assets 
each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
if different assumptions are used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
impairment of intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from three to sixteen years 
in process research and development is carried at its 
table of contents initial fair value and will be amortized to expense upon completion of development 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life

the product configuration  which reflects the mix of session capacity and requested features  determines the prices for each sbc sold 
customers can license our software in various configurations  depending on requirements for session capacity  feature groups and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of a system sold 
systems with higher software content higher session capacity and a higher number of feature groups will generally have a higher average selling price than those systems sold with a lower software content

the  increase in cost of maintenance  support and service revenue was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits of  corresponding with a increase in employee headcount for our support and services organization  an increase in third party services of  and a  increase in stock based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by decrease of  in repair and warranty costs as our products mature and product reliability continues to improve

indirect product revenues decreased million  with million and  contributed by our international and united states and canadian customers  respectively 
while the decrease in the number of units shipped had an adverse effect on our product revenues in  the decline was partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of our systems due to changes in our product software configuration mix and an increase in the level of software license upgrades

use of non gaap financial measures we use the financial measures non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share to supplement our consolidated financial statements  which are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the presentation of non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share is not meant to be a substitute for net income or net income per share  presented in accordance with gaap  but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with net income and net income per share 
our management believes that the presentation of non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share provides useful information to investors because this financial measure excludes stock based compensation expense which is a non cash charge 
non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share for the years ended december  also excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets  merger and integration related costs and gain associated with our acquisition of covergence inc on april  by excluding stock based compensation expense  amortization of acquired intangible assets  merger and integration related expenses and the gain associated with our acquisition of covergence  we can compare our ongoing operations to prior periods and to the ongoing operations of other companies in our industry who may have materially different unusual charges 
we do not consider any of stock based compensation expense  amortization of acquired intangible assets  merger and integration related expenses and the gain associated with our acquisition of covergence to be part of our ongoing operating activities or meaningful in evaluating our past financial performance or future prospects 
we believe that excluding these items is useful to investors because it is more representative of ongoing costs and therefore more comparable to historical operations 
non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share are primary financial indicators that our management uses to evaluate our financial results and forecast anticipated financial results for future periods 
we also use these non gaap figures to make 
table of contents financial and operational decisions as these numbers exclude non operational activities 
these non gaap measures should not be considered measures of the our liquidity 
our definition of non gaap net income and or non gaap net income per share may differ from similar measures used by other companies and may differ from period to period 
we may make other adjustments for expenses and gains that it does not consider reflective of core operating performance in a particular period and may modify non gaap net income and or non gaap net income per share by excluding these expenses and gains

the cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
restricted cash  which totaled million at december  and  at december  and is not included in cash and cash equivalents  and was held in certificates of deposit as collateral for letters of credit related to the lease agreements for our current corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts  our sales office in madrid  spain as well as our new corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts to which we will relocate in june accounts receivable  net 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
the fluctuations vary depending on the timing of our shipping and billing activity  cash collections  and changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in some situations we receive cash payment from a customer prior to the time we are able to recognize revenue on a transaction 
we record these payments as deferred revenue  which has a positive effect on our accounts receivable balances 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on a quarterly basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  divided by b total revenue for the most recent quarter  multiplied by c days 
dso was days at december  and days at december  the decrease in dso at december  was primarily due to improved collection effort during the year as well as the timing of shipments during the three months ended december  operating activities

anticipated cash flows 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments and our cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our revenue growth  our introduction of new products and enhancements  and our expansion of sales and marketing and product development activities 
to the extent that our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies and products that will complement our existing operations 
in the event additional funding is required  and given the current condition of the global financial markets  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or affect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
income taxes 
we currently expect to realize recorded net deferred tax assets as of december  of million 
our conclusion that these assets will be recovered is based upon its expectation that our current and future earnings will provide sufficient taxable income to realize the recorded tax assets 
the realization of our net deferred tax assets cannot be assured  and to the extent that future taxable income against which these tax assets may be applied is not sufficient  some or all of our recorded net deferred tax asset would not be realizable 
approximately million of the deferred tax assets recorded as of december  is attributable to benefits associated with stock based compensation charges 
in accordance with the guidance in asc  no valuation allowance has been recorded against this amount 
however  in the future  if the underlying amounts expire with an intrinsic value less than the fair value of the awards on the date of grant  some or all of the benefits may not be realizable 
as of december   we had state research and development tax credits of million of which approximately million related to excess tax deductions  the benefit of these credits will be realized as an increase in additional paid in capital when it results in a reduction in state taxable income 
these state tax credits begin to expire in  and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the taxing authorities

our only significant contractual obligations relate to the lease of our corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts which expires in june of  our new facility in bedford  massachusetts which we will be relocating to in june and our office facilities in madrid  spain 
on december  we entered into a lease dated as of november  with mscp crosby  llc to secure office space for our future corporate headquarters at crosby drive  bedford  massachusetts 
the commencement date for occupancy under the lease is june  the lease for our current corporate headquarters at third ave  burlington  massachusetts expires on june  the lease for our future corporate headquarters provides for the rental of  square feet of space and has an initial term of six years and six months 
we can  subject to certain conditions  extend this term for an additional period of five years 
we are not required to pay any rent for the first six months of the initial lease term 
thereafter  the annual rent on the new lease will be million  or approximately  per month 
the total base rent payable in the initial lease term is million 
in addition to base rent  the lease for our future corporate headquarters requires us to pay our proportionate share of certain taxes and operating expenses  as further set forth in the lease 
we are receiving lease incentives  including free rent for the first six months of occupancy  which totals approximately million  and allowances for tenant improvements totaling approximately million 
we will recognize the total base rent payable of million ratably over the initial lease term of the lease which is months 
the allowances for tenant improvements will be amortized on a straight line basis over the initial lease term as a reduction of rental expense 
in connection with the signing of the lease for our future headquarters  we have deposited with the landlord an unconditional  irrevocable letter of credit in the landlord s favor in the amount of the following table sets forth our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash after december  more than total year or less years years years in thousands operating leases obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k as promulgated by the sec 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu   subsequent events topic  to remove the requirement for sec filers to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events 
this change removes potential conflicts with current sec guidance 
asu also clarifies the intended scope of the reissuance disclosure provisions 
asu is effective upon issuance and had no impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb ratified asu  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which would modify the objective and reliable evidence of fair value threshold as it relates to assigning value to specific deliverables in a multiple element arrangement 
this authoritative guidance would allow the use of an estimated selling price for undelivered elements for purposes of separating elements included in multiple element arrangements and allocating arrangement consideration when neither vsoe nor acceptable third party evidence of the selling price of the undelivered element are 
table of contents available 
additionally  the fasb ratified asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  which provides that tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality should be considered non software deliverables  and therefore  will no longer be within the scope of the revenue recognition guidance 
both fasb updates are required to be adopted in annual periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of both pieces of authoritative guidance may have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued the asc as the single source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
while the adoption of the asc as of september  changes how we reference accounting standards  the adoption did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  or accounting policies 
in may  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events asc 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption of asc had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asc  business combinations asc 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applies to all business combinations 
asc provides that  upon initially obtaining control  an acquirer shall recognize percent of the fair values of acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions  even if the acquirer has not acquired percent of its target 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated 
additionally  asc changes current practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs will be expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  pre acquisition contingencies  such as legal issues  will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value  in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  the requirements in asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  would have to be met at the acquisition date  and in process research and development charges will no longer be recorded 
with the adoption of asc  goodwill is no longer reduced when utilizing net operating loss carry forwards for which a full valuation allowance exists 
the adoption of asc was effective for our acquisition of covergence in april item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk to date  substantially all of our international customer agreements have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
the functional currency of our international operations in europe and asia is the us dollar 
accordingly  all operating assets and liabilities of these international subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of these international subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars at the 
table of contents average rates in effect during the year 
any differences resulting from the re measurement of assets  liabilities and operations of the european and asian subsidiaries are recorded within other income in the consolidated statements of income 
if the foreign currency exchange rates fluctuated by as of december   our foreign exchange exposure would have fluctuated by less than  interest rate risk at december   we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in high quality securities of a short duration and are not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short nature of our short term investments and low current market yields of our long term investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future interest income
