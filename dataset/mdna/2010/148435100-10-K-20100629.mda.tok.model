item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and market premium and super premium brands in the following beverage alcohol categories rum  whiskey  liqueurs  vodka  tequila and fine wine 
we distribute our products in all us states and the district of columbia  in twelve primary international markets  including ireland  great britain  northern ireland  germany  canada  bulgaria  france  russia  finland  norway  sweden  china and the duty free markets  and in a number of other countries in continental europe and latin america 
we market the following brands  among others  gosling s rum  jefferson stm  jefferson s reserve and jefferson stm presidential select bourbons  clontarf irish whiskey  pallini liqueurs  boru vodka  knappogue castle whiskey  tierrastm tequila and betts scholltm wines 
our objective is to continue building a distinctive portfolio of global premium and super premium spirits and wine brands 
we have shifted our focus from a volume oriented approach to a profit centric focus 
to achieve this  we continue to seek to increase revenues from existing brands 
we are focusing our existing distribution relationships  sales expertise and targeted marketing activities to concentrate on our more profitable brands by expanding our domestic and international distribution relationships to increase the mutual benefits of concentrating on our most profitable brands  while continuing to achieve brand recognition and growth and gain additional market share for our brands within retail stores  bars and restaurants  and thereby with end consumers  improve value chain and manage cost structure 
we have undergone a comprehensive review and analysis of our supply chain and cost structure both on a company wide and brand by brand basis 
this has included restructurings and personnel reductions throughout our company 
we further intend to map  analyze and redesign our purchasing and supply systems to reduce costs in our current operations and achieve profitability in future operations  selectively add new premium brands to our portfolio 
we intend to continue developing new brands and pursuing strategic relationships  joint ventures and acquisitions to selectively expand our premium spirits and wine portfolio  particularly by capitalizing on and expanding our already demonstrated partnering capabilities 
our criteria for new brands focuses on underserved areas of the beverage alcohol marketplace  while examining the potential for direct financial contribution to our company and the potential for future growth based on development and maturation of agency brands 
we will evaluate future acquisitions and agency relationships on the basis of their potential to be immediately accretive and their potential contributions to our objectives of becoming profitable and further expanding our product offerings 
we expect that future acquisitions  if consummated  would involve some combination of cash  debt and the issuance of our stock  and cost containment 
we have taken significant steps to reduce our costs  which has resulted in a significant decrease in selling expense and general and administrative expense 
these steps included reducing staff in our us and international operations  restructuring our international distribution system  changing distributor relationships in certain markets  restructuring the gosling castle partners  inc working relationship  moving production of certain products to a lower cost facility in the us  and reducing general and administrative costs  including professional fees  insurance  occupancy and other overhead costs 
efforts to reduce expenses further continue 
recent developments betts scholl acquisition in september  we acquired the assets of betts scholl llc  a premium wine maker formed in by master sommelier richard betts and dennis scholl 
in the transaction  we issued to the sellers a total of million shares of our common stock and approximately million of notes  of which million was paid at closing 
dennis scholl has joined our board of directors  where he serves as an independent director  and richard betts has joined us as a vice president and head of our newly formed fine wine division 
the fine wine division has been created to market and sell a select portfolio of premium wines from around the world 
as part of our fine wine strategy  we seek to recruit and represent the wines of a small number of premium  like minded brand owners and wineries 
the goal is to establish enough high quality wine expressions to provide a reasonable offering to customers 
at the same time  however  we expect to limit the number of brands so each brand receives the attention it deserves 
the division will take advantage of our existing infrastructure  including our distribution system 
in june  we entered into an agreement with grand cru selections  a new york city fine wine distributor  under which we will act as us importer and marketer for cerbaie brunello di montalcino and grand cru will act as a wholesaler in new york and new jersey for a select range of our fine wines 
bourbon purchase in december  we acquired a rare stock of aged bourbon which will supply our currently forecasted supply needs for jefferson s and jefferson s reserve very small batch kentucky bourbons 
to concentrate our efforts on the jefferson s bourbons  which have experienced double digit growth during the past year  we divested our sam houston bourbon brand and existing inventory for million in cash 
we expect the bourbon category to be an area for continued growth 
we believe that the jefferson s brand has strong potential to develop an avid following among bourbon connoisseurs 
reincorporation effective as of february   we completed a reincorporation transaction under which castle brands inc  a delaware corporation castle delaware  merged with and into castle brands florida inc  a florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of castle delaware castle florida  with castle florida being the surviving entity and being renamed castle brands inc as a result of the reincorporation  the legal domicile of the surviving entity is now the state of florida 
in the reincorporation  each outstanding share of castle delaware common stock  par value per share  was converted into one share of castle florida common stock  par value per share 
credit facility in december  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with  among others  frost gamma investments trust  vector group ltd  a principal shareholder of ours  lafferty ltd  a principal shareholder of ours  ivc investors  lllp  an entity affiliated with glenn halpryn  a director of ours  mark andrews  our chairman  and richard j 
lampen  our president and chief executive officer 
under the credit agreement  we may borrow from time to time up to million to be used for working capital or general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit agreement mature on april  and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly 
the credit agreement provides for the payment of an aggregate commitment fee of  payable to the lenders over the three year period 
amounts may be repaid and reborrowed under the credit agreement without penalty 
in april  we borrowed million under this credit agreement 
the note issued under the credit agreement contains customary events of default  which if uncured  entitle the holders to accelerate the due date of the unpaid principal amount of  and all accrued and unpaid interest on  such note 
the note is secured by million of inventory and million in trade accounts receivable of castle brands usa corp  our wholly owned subsidiary  which we refer to as cb usa  under a security agreement 
promissory note in june  we issued a million promissory note to frost gamma investments trust  an entity affiliated with phillip frost  md  a director and principal shareholder of ours frost note 
borrowings under the frost note mature on june  and bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest is accrued quarterly and due at maturity 
the frost note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity without penalty  but with payment of accrued interest to the date of prepayment 
the frost note does not contain any financial covenants 
share repurchase in june  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a privately negotiated transaction 
also  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to buy up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
operations overview we generate revenue through the sale of our products to our network of wholesale distributors or  in control states  state owned agencies  which  in turn  distribute our brands to retail outlets 
in the us  our sales price per case includes excise tax and import duties  which are also reflected in a corresponding increase in our cost of sales 
most of our international sales are sold in bond  with the excise taxes paid by our customers upon shipment  thereby resulting in lower relative revenue as well as a lower relative cost of sales  although some of our united kingdom sales are sold tax paid  as in the united states 
the difference between sales and net sales principally reflects adjustments for various distributor incentives 
our gross profit is determined by the prices at which we sell our products  our ability to control our cost of sales  the relative mix of our case sales by brand and geography and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
our cost of sales is principally driven by our cost of procurement  bottling and packaging  which differs by brand  as well as freight and warehousing costs 
we purchase certain products  such as the gosling s rums  pallini liqueurs and tierras tequila  as finished goods 
for other products  such as the boru vodkas  we purchase the components  including the distilled spirits  bottles and packaging materials  and have arrangements with third parties for bottling and packaging 
our us sales typically have a higher absolute gross margin than in other markets  as sales prices per case are generally higher in the us than elsewhere 
selling expense principally includes advertising and marketing expenditures and compensation paid to our marketing and sales personnel 
our selling expense  as a percentage of sales and per case  is higher than that of our competitors because of our brand development costs  level of marketing expenditures and established sales force versus our relatively small base of case sales and sales volumes 
however  we believe that maintaining an infrastructure capable of supporting future growth is the correct long term approach for us 
while we expect the absolute level of selling expense to increase in the coming years  we expect selling expense as a percentage of revenues and on a per case basis to decline  as our volumes expand and our sales team sells a larger number of brands 
general and administrative expense relates to corporate and administrative functions that support our operations and includes administrative payroll  occupancy and related expenses and professional services 
we expect general and administrative expense in fiscal to be comparable to fiscal  as we continue to control core spending 
we expect our general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales to decline due to economies of scale 
we expect to increase our case sales in the us and internationally over the next several years through organic growth  and through the extension of our product line via line extensions  acquisitions and distribution agreements 
we will seek to maintain liquidity and manage our working capital and overall capital resources during this period of anticipated growth to achieve our long term objectives  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we continue to believe the following industry trends will create growth opportunities for us  including the divestiture of smaller and emerging non core brands by major spirits companies as they continue to consolidate  increased barriers to entry  particularly in the us  due to continued consolidation and the difficulty in establishing an extensive distribution network  such as the one we maintain  the trend by small private and family owned spirits brand owners to partner with  or be acquired by  a company with global distribution 
we expect to be an attractive alternative to our larger competitors for these brand owners as one of the few modestly sized publicly traded spirits companies  and growth in the non spirits segments of the beverage alcohol industry  particularly wine  which may allow us to grow our portfolio and leverage our distribution network 
our growth strategy is based upon partnering with other brands  acquiring smaller and emerging brands and growing existing brands 
to identify potential partner and acquisition candidates we plan to rely on our management s industry experience and our extensive network of industry contacts 
we also plan to maintain and grow our us and international distribution channels so that we are more attractive to spirits companies who are looking for a route to market for their products 
with respect to foreign and small private and family owned spirits brands  we will continue to be flexible and creative in the structure and form of our proposals and present an alternative to the larger spirits companies 
we intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources  bank borrowings and  in appropriate circumstances  the further issuance of equity and or debt securities 
acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position  and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
additionally  the pursuit of acquisitions and other new business relationships may require significant management attention 
we may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates  obtain financing on favorable terms or complete these types of transactions in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
financial performance overview the following table provides information regarding our case sales for the periods presented based on nine liter equivalent cases  which is a standard industry metric 
years ended march  cases united states international total rum vodka liqueurs whiskey tequila wine total percentage of cases united states international total rum vodka liqueurs whiskey tequila wine total critical accounting policies and estimates a number of estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  amounts of sales and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions discussed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations in that they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to a customer generally a distributor  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale fob shipping point or fob destination and collection is reasonably assured 
we do not offer a right of return but will accept returns if we shipped the wrong product or wrong quantity 
revenue is not recognized on shipments to control states in the united states until such time as product is sold through to the retail channel 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value 
this value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts 
we calculate this allowance based on our history of write offs  level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with  and economic status of  our customers 
inventory valuation our inventory  which consists of distilled spirits  bulk wine  dry good raw materials bottles  labels and caps  packaging and finished goods  is valued at the lower of cost or market  using the weighted average cost method 
we assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
reduction to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of march   of goodwill that arose from acquisitions was recorded 
no goodwill that arose from acquisitions was recorded as of march  goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of rights  trademarks  trade names and formulations 
we are required to analyze our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as well as when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
certain factors that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to  operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry or market economic trends 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
in the first step the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting units 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined at each of march  and by weighting a combination of the present value of our discounted anticipated future operating cash flows and values based on market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable companies 
we did not record an impairment on goodwill or other intangible assets for fiscal the valuations resulted in us recording a goodwill impairment of approximately million and an impairment on other intangible assets of million for fiscal intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we are required to amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and to review intangible assets with estimable useful lives for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
stock based awards we follow current authoritative guidance regarding stock based compensation  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense  based on their fair values on the date of grant 
stock based compensation for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted 
the assumptions used in valuing the options granted during fiscal and are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments asc  financial instruments asc  defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments 
we believe that there is no material difference between the fair value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the balance sheets due to the short term maturity of these instruments  or with respect to the debt  as compared to the current borrowing rates available to us 
further  our investments have been classified within level of asc and are reported at fair value

the table below presents the increase or decrease  as applicable  in case sales by product category for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  increase decrease percentage in case sales increase decrease overall us overall us rum vodka liqueurs whiskey tequila wine total our international case sales and revenue decreased during the year ended march  as evidenced by a reduction in case sales when compared to the prior year period 
this decrease was due to our continued efforts to focus on our more profitable brands and markets  difficult market conditions in most markets  particularly ireland  northern ireland  great britain and italy  the effects of the restructuring of our international operations  and certain distributor changes necessary in germany and the uk gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended march   from million for the prior year period  while our gross margin increased to for the year ended march  compared to for the prior year period 
during the year ended march  and  we recorded reversals of our allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory of million and million  respectively 
we recorded these reversals because we were able to sell certain goods included in the allowance recorded during previous fiscal years 
we recorded the reversals as a decrease in cost of sales 
absent the reversals of the allowance  our gross profit was million and million for each of the years ended march  and  and our gross margin was and  respectively 
selling expense 
selling expense decreased to million for the year ended march  from million for the prior year period 
this decrease in selling expense was attributable to our continued cost containment efforts  including a decrease in advertising  marketing and promotion expense of million for the year ended march  compared to the prior year period 
we also reduced sales and marketing staff in both our domestic and international operations  resulting in a decrease of employee expense  including salaries  related benefits and travel and entertainment  of million for the year ended march  compared to the prior year period  which prior year period included million in severance charges and million in stock based compensation expense

a decrease of million in professional fees and decreases of million in occupancy and million in insurance expense  respectively  were due to our ongoing cost containment efforts 
as a result  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the prior year period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to a million charge to fiscal expense from a change in the estimated useful life of our supply agreement with the carbery group ltd 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment 
under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the fair value of each of our reporting units was determined at march  and by weighting a combination of the present value of our discounted anticipated future operating cash flows and values based on ebitda of comparable companies 
we did not record an impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal the valuations resulted in a goodwill impairment of approximately million and an impairment on other intangible assets of million for fiscal loss from operations 
as a result of the foregoing  our loss from operations improved million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the prior year period 
as a result of our continued cost containment efforts  our focus on our more profitable brands and markets  and expected organic growth of our brands  we anticipate continued improved results of operations in the near term as compared to prior year periods  although there is no assurance that we will attain such results 
foreign exchange gain loss 
foreign exchange gain for the year ended march  was million as compared to a loss of million for the year ended march  due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound and its effect on our euro and british pound denominated intercompany advances to our foreign subsidiaries 
in november  to improve the liquidity of our foreign subsidiaries  we converted our intercompany balances into an additional investment in these subsidiaries 
beginning december   the translation gain or loss from the restatement of the investments in our foreign subsidiaries is included in other comprehensive income 
prior to this conversion  we considered these transactions to be trading balances and short term funding subject to transaction adjustment under asc  foreign currency matters 
as such  at each balance sheet date  we restated the euro denominated intercompany balances included on the books of the foreign subsidiaries in us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  with the resulting foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in net loss 
interest income expense  net 
we had interest income  net of million for the fiscal as compared to interest expense  net of million for fiscal we eliminated this expense by converting and exchanging all of our senior notes and convertible subordinated notes for equity during fiscal and fiscal in december  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement as described below in liquidity and capital resources 
we anticipate that from time to time over the next three years we may borrow up to the full limit of our credit facility to fund operations  inventory requirements and potential acquisition opportunities 
these borrowings would result in additional interest expense in future periods 
gain on sale of intangible asset 
in november  we sold our sam houston bourbon brand to a third party for million in cash

net loss per common share basic and diluted was positively affected by the increase in common shares outstanding resulting from the common stock issued in connection with the fiscal series a preferred stock transaction and the fiscal betts scholl  llc acquisition 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our industry is subject to seasonality with peak sales in each major category generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter  which is our third fiscal quarter

beginning december   the translation gain or loss from the restatement of the investments in our foreign subsidiaries is included in other comprehensive income 
prior to this conversion  we considered these transactions to be trading balances and short term funding subject to transaction adjustment 
as such  at each balance sheet date  we restated the euro denominated intercompany balances included on the books of the foreign subsidiaries in us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  with the resulting foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in net loss 
where in this annual report we refer to amounts in euros or british pounds  we have for your convenience also in certain cases provided a conversion of those amounts to us dollars in parentheses 
where the numbers refer to a specific balance sheet account date or financial statement account period  we have used the exchange rate that was used to perform the conversions in connection with the applicable financial statement 
in all other instances  unless otherwise indicated  the conversions have been made using the exchange rates as of march   each as calculated from the interbank exchange rates as reported by oanda 
com 
on march   the exchange rate of the euro and the british pound in exchange for us dollars were us equivalent to us for euros and us equivalent to us for british pounds 
these conversions should not be construed as representations that the euro and british pound amounts actually represent us dollar amounts or could be converted into us dollars at the rates indicated 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations during fiscal or severe increases in inflation  however  could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations
