item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item  included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion also contains forward looking statements that include risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview we are an automated global electronic market maker and broker specializing in routing orders and executing and processing trades in securities  futures and foreign exchange instruments on more than electronic exchanges and trading venues around the world 
since our inception in  we have focused on developing proprietary software to automate broker dealer functions 
the advent of electronic exchanges in the last years has provided us with the opportunity to integrate our software with an increasing number of exchanges and trading venues into one automatically functioning  computerized platform that requires minimal human intervention 
in connection with the ipo priced on may   ibg  inc purchased of the membership interests in ibg llc  became the sole managing member of ibg llc and began to consolidate ibg llc s financial results into its financial statements 
overview of recapitalization transactions and our organizational structure prior to the ipo  we had historically conducted our business through a limited liability company structure 
our primary assets are our ownership of approximately of the membership interests of ibg llc  the current holding company for our businesses  and our controlling interest and related contractual rights as the sole managing member of ibg llc 
the remaining approximately of ibg llc membership interests are held by ibg holdings llc  a holding company that is owned by our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  thomas peterffy  and his affiliates  management and other employees of ibg llc  and certain other members 
the ibg llc membership interests held by ibg holdings llc will be subject to purchase by us over time in connection with offerings by us of shares of our common stock 
purchases of ibg llc membership interests  held by ibg holdings llc  by the company are governed by the exchange agreement by and among the company  ibg holdings llc  ibg llc and the members of ibg llc  dated as of may  the exchange agreement  a copy of the fully executed agreement was filed as an exhibit to our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and filed with the sec on november  under the exchange agreement  ibg holdings llc may request redemption of its membership interests in ibg llc and the company is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate a public offering of a number of shares of class a common stock approximately equal to the aggregate number of the ibg holdings llc membership interests for which redemption has been requested 
upon consummation of such public offering  the company is required to purchase from ibg holdings llc that number of ibg llc membership interests equal to the aggregate number of the ibg holdings llc membership interests subject to redemption  at a purchase price per membership interest equal to the offering price in such public offering 
however  under the exchange agreement  the company is not obligated to effect any purchase of the ibg llc membership interests held by ibg holdings llc unless and until the company has consummated a public offering of a number of shares of class a common stock approximately equal to the aggregate number of the ibg holdings llc membership interests subject to redemption 
in both and  public offerings were not consummated 

table of contents as an alternative  at the option of  and upon mutual agreement of  the company  ibg holdings llc and ibg llc  instead of  or in addition to  consummating one or more public offerings  redemptions of ibg holdings llc membership interests may be effected by using cash on hand at ibg llc and corresponding redemptions by ibg llc of its membership interests held by ibg holdings llc 
this alternative funding method would not impose any obligations on the company 
in and  some of the ibg holdings llc membership interests were  in fact  redeemed using cash from ibg llc 
business segments the company reports its results in two business segments  market making and electronic brokerage 
these segments are analyzed separately as we derive our revenues from these two principal business activities as well as allocate resources and assess performance 
market making 
we conduct our market making business through our th subsidiaries 
as one of the largest market makers on many of the world s leading exchanges  we provide liquidity by offering competitively tight bid offer spreads over a broad base of over  tradable  exchange listed products 
as principal  we commit our own capital and derive revenues or incur losses from the difference between the price paid when securities are bought and the price received when those securities are sold 
because we provide continuous bid and offer quotations and we are continuously both buying and selling quoted securities  we may have either a long or a short position in a particular product at a given point in time 
our entire portfolio is evaluated each second and continuously rebalanced throughout the trading day  thus minimizing the risk of our portfolio at all times 
this real time rebalancing of our portfolio  together with our real time proprietary risk management system  enables us to curtail risk and to be profitable in both up market and down market scenarios 
electronic brokerage 
we conduct our electronic brokerage business through our ib subsidiaries 
as an electronic broker  we execute  clear and settle trades globally for both institutional and individual customers 
capitalizing on the technology originally developed for our market making business  ib s systems provide our customers with the capability to monitor multiple markets around the world simultaneously and to execute trades electronically in these markets at a low cost  in multiple products and currencies from a single trading account 
we offer our customers access to all classes of tradable  exchange listed products  including stocks  bonds  options  futures and forex  traded on more than exchanges and market centers and in countries around the world seamlessly 
business environment during  we witnessed a significant shift in market conditions that affect our profitability as market makers 
unlike  which was an extraordinary year in the financial markets and during which we posted record profits  the drivers that determine our trading gains shifted away from our favor in these drivers include trading volume  our share of that volume  and the bid offer spread in the market  the last of which is determined by competition among market participants 
these factors  together with other random elements such as rising or falling volatilities  relationship of implied vs 
actual volatilities in the market  currency fluctuations  and the frequency of sudden  large price moves in certain securities that may be correctly foreseen by some traders will determine our profitability for any period 
during  bid offer spreads narrowed substantially  particularly in the u 
s  due to the increasing level of competition in the listed options market 
this effect was more pronounced earlier in the year and appeared to have leveled off by the end of the year 
we believe much of this competition comes 
table of contents from the ever growing presence of high frequency traders hfts in the listed options market 
these traders compete with market makers  but receive certain customer preferences on exchanges  in particular  they pay no exchange fees and their orders are given priority over market makers quoting at the same prices 
at the end of and in the beginning of  two large us options exchanges implemented new rules to identify and properly classify hfts as professionals  thus removing these advantages from them 
in addition  hfts will now be required to pay exchange fees on these exchanges  further leveling the playing field with market makers 
while we are not yet able to gauge the full impact of these rules  we anticipate a positive impact on our market share and our ability to interact with customer orders if the rules are fully implemented and effectively enforced 
market volatilities descended from the extreme levels witnessed at the end of  though they remained at levels that are favorable for our trading strategies 
generally  we maintain an overall long volatility position  which protects us against a severe market dislocation in either direction and enables us to provide liquidity to buyers in up markets and sellers in down markets 
when volatility rose to unusually high levels  as a protective measure we chose to curtail our long volatility position  which resulted in fewer trading opportunities for us 
however  in the second half of  we were able to re establish our long volatility strategy 
when we are long volatility  the ratio of actual to implied volatility is more meaningful to our results 
a higher ratio is generally favorable  while a lower ratio generally has a negative effect on our trading gains  due to the resulting high cost of hedging our positions 
during  this ratio fell to an average of approximately from an average of in the electronic brokerage segment is primarily driven by growth in customer trading volumes  which are impacted by trends in volatility levels and global trade volumes  and to a lesser extent by market prices 
the majority of our customer base is comprised of experienced  professional traders who have shown greater resilience to severe market swings than average retail investors 
our customer accounts continue to grow and activity levels of cleared customers  which generate direct revenues for the brokerage segment  remain healthy 
according to data received from exchanges worldwide  volumes in exchange listed equity based options increased in by approximately in the us and globally  compared to while investors are more cautious than they were prior to the market turmoil in  we believe the growth of the equity culture will continue and will have a long term positive effect on trading volumes 
during we accounted for approximately of the exchange listed equity based options including options on etfs and stock index products volume traded worldwide and approximately of exchange listed equity based options volume traded in the us this compares to approximately of the exchange listed equity based options volume traded worldwide and approximately of the exchange listed equity based options volume traded in the us in the decrease in our market share can be attributed to our reduced participation in low priced high volatility stocks  which are not ideal for our option pricing model  an increase in trading by hfts  which by virtue of their priority over us  has been taking a larger share of the listed option volume  and the fact that many high volume options are now quoted so tightly  often a penny wide  that we are no longer on both the best bid and offer in every option 
see the tables on pages of this annual report on form k for additional details regarding our trade volumes  contract and share volumes and brokerage statistics 
in september  the sec approved an expansion of the penny pilot program 
the program was first introduced in february to cover classes of options and has since been extended to cover options classes that account for over of us options volume 
options in the pilot program trade in minimum increments of one cent  rather than the five and ten cent increments quoted in other option classes 
this most recent sec approval will extend the proposed pilot through december  and add an additional issues to the penny quoted classes  for a total of issues 
table of contents representing of us options volume 
the additional options classes will be phased in on a quarterly basis 
the first additional classes being quoted in pennies began in october the effect of this expansion on our results is difficult to estimate at this time  as it will depend on the increase in trading volumes due to tighter bid offer spreads relative to the increase in our market maker share as a result of new exchange rules to classify hfts as professional customers 
certain other potential regulatory changes are currently being reviewed and publicly debated  such as permanent adoption of regulations to curb abusive short selling of stocks  measures to increase transparency of the securities lending markets and a proposal to ban naked sponsored access on exchanges 
if passed  these changes may impact our business 
we generally take the view that in a more efficient and more transparent market through our emphasis on building technology we can provide better service to our customers and share in the benefit 
accordingly  we see these developments as  on balance  positive 
financial overview diluted earnings per share were for year ended december  the calculation of diluted earnings per share is detailed in note  initial public offering and recapitalization  to the audited consolidated financial statements  in part ii  item of this annual report on form k

our pre tax margin for the year ended december  was  compared to for during the year ended december   income before income taxes in our market making segment decreased  compared with trading gains were hampered by increased competition from high frequency traders and the continued tightening of bid offer spreads in the market 
pre tax margin decreased to in compared to in during the year ended december   income before income taxes in our electronic brokerage segment grew compared to a decrease in net revenues was offset by a decrease in non interest expenses 
the decrease in net revenues was driven by a decline in net interest income  as lower interest rates had a negative impact on interest earned on customer cash balances

for the year ended december  commission and execution fees were down as compared to same period in total daily average revenue trades darts for cleared and execution only customers decreased to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  market making  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period may be materially affected by volumes in the global financial markets  the level of competition and other factors 
electronic brokerage is more predictable  but it is dependent on customer activity  growth in customer accounts and assets  interest rates and other factors 
for a further discussion of the factors  that may affect our future operating results  please see the description of risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 

table of contents the following two tables present net revenues and income before income taxes for each of our business segments for the periods indicated 
net revenues of each of our business segments and our total net revenues are summarized below year ended december  in millions market making electronic brokerage corporate total corporate includes corporate related activities as well as inter segment eliminations 
income before income taxes of each of our business segments and our total income before income taxes are summarized below year ended december  in millions market making electronic brokerage corporate total corporate includes corporate related activities as well as inter segment eliminations 
revenue trading gains our revenue base is comprised largely of trading gains generated in the normal course of market making 
trading revenues are  in general  proportional to the trading activity in the markets 
our revenue base is highly diversified and comprised of millions of relatively small individual trades of various financial products traded on electronic exchanges  primarily stocks  options and futures 
trading gains accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trading gains also include translation gains and losses on cash and positions in foreign currency held primarily by our foreign market making subsidiaries as well as revenues from net dividends 
market making activities require us to hold a substantial inventory of equity securities 
we derive significant revenues in the form of dividend income from these equity securities 
this dividend income is largely offset by dividend expense incurred when we make significant payments in lieu of dividends on short positions in securities in our portfolio 
dividend income and expense arise from holding market making positions over dates on which dividends are paid to shareholders of record 
when a stock pays a dividend  its market price is generally adjusted downward to reflect the value paid to the shareholders of record  which will not be received by those who purchase the stock after the dividend date 
hence  the apparent gains and losses due to these price changes must be taken together with the dividends paid and received  respectively  in order to accurately reflect the results of our market making operations 
as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading gains and our net interest income from the market making segment are interchangeable and 
table of contents depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income 
our trading gains are geographically diversified 
in  and  we generated  and  respectively  of our trading gains from operations conducted internationally 
commissions and execution fees we earn commissions and execution fees from our cleared customers for whom we act as executing and clearing brokers and from our non cleared customers for whom we act as an executing broker only 
we have a commission structure that allows customers to choose between an all inclusive bundled rate or an unbundled rate that has lower commissions for high volume customers 
for unbundled commissions  we charge regulatory and exchange fees  at our cost  separately from our commissions  adding transparency to our fee structure 
commissions and execution fees accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our commissions and execution fees are geographically diversified 
in  and we generated  and  respectively of commissions and execution fees from operations conducted internationally 
interest income and interest expense we earn interest on customer funds segregated in safekeeping accounts  on customer borrowings on margin  secured by marketable securities these customers hold with us  from our investment in government treasury securities  from borrowing securities in the general course of our market making and brokerage activities  and on bank balances 
interest income accounted for  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income is partially offset by interest expense 
we pay interest on cash balances customers hold with us  for cash received from lending securities in the general course of our market making and brokerage activities  and on our borrowings 
interest expense was  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have automated and integrated our securities lending system with our trading system 
as a result  we have been able to tailor our securities lending activity to produce more optimal results when taken together with trading gains see description under trading gains above 
our net interest income accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other income other income consists primarily of payment for order flow income  market data fee income and mark to market gains or losses on non traded securities primarily investments in exchanges 
our other income accounted for approximately   and of our total revenues for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs and expenses execution and clearing expenses our largest single expense category is execution and clearing expenses  which includes the costs of executing and clearing our market making and electronic brokerage trades  as well as other direct 
table of contents expenses  including payment for order flow  regulatory fees and market data fees 
execution fees are paid primarily to electronic exchanges and market centers on which we trade 
clearing fees are paid to clearing houses and clearing agents 
payments for order flow are made as part of exchange mandated programs and to otherwise attract order volume to our system 
market data fees are fees that we must pay to third parties to receive streaming quotes and related information 
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits includes salaries  bonuses  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs and other related employee costs 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization occupancy expense consists primarily of rental payments on office and data center leases and related occupancy costs  such as utilities 
depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of fixed assets such as computing and communications hardware as well as amortization of leasehold improvements and capitalized in house software development 
communications communications expense consists primarily of the cost of voice and data telecommunications lines supporting our business including connectivity to exchanges around the world 
general and administrative expenses in this category are primarily incurred for professional services  such as legal and audit work  and other operating expenses such as advertising and exchange membership lease expenses 
income tax expense historically  our business was operated through a limited liability company that was not subject to us federal and certain state income taxes  our income tax expense consisted primarily of corporate subsidiary taxes  and our net income did not reflect cash distributions to ibg llc s members to pay their taxes related to their proportionate shares of our net income 
those distributions reduced ibg llc s members capital 
after the ipo  we became subject to taxes applicable to c corporations 
as a corporation  we are required to pay us federal  state and local income taxes on our taxable income  which is proportional to the percentage of ibg llc owned by ibg 
our subsidiaries will continue to be subject to income tax in the respective jurisdictions in which they operate 
non controlling interest we are the sole managing member of ibg llc and  as such  operate and control all of the business and affairs of ibg llc and its subsidiaries and consolidate ibg llc s financial results into our financial statements 
we hold approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
ibg holdings llc is owned by the original members of ibg llc and holds approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
we reflect ibg holdings llc s ownership as a non controlling interest in our statement of financial condition and statement of income 
our historical results are those of ibg llc  as our predecessor company 
as a result  our net income  after excluding ibg holdings llc s non controlling interest  represents approximately of ibg llc s net income and similarly  outstanding shares of our common stock represent approximately of the outstanding membership interests of ibg llc 

table of contents certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our continuing operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
over the past several years  the effects of market structure changes  competition and market conditions have  during certain periods  exerted downward pressure on bid offer spreads realized by market makers 
retail broker dealer participation in the equity markets has fluctuated over the past few years due to investor sentiment  market conditions and a variety of other factors 
retail transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable 
in recent years  in an effort to improve the quality of their executions as well as increase efficiencies  market makers have increased the level of automation within their operations  which may allow them to compete more effectively with us 
there has been increased scrutiny of equity and option market makers  hedge funds and soft dollar practices by the regulatory and legislative authorities 
new legislation or modifications to existing regulations and rules could occur in the future 
there has been consolidation among market centers over the past few years  which may adversely affect the value of our smart routing software 
a driver of our market making profits is the relationship between actual and implied volatility in the equities markets 
the cost of maintaining our conservative risk profile is based on implied volatility  while our profitability  in part  is based on actual volatility 
hence  our profitability is increased when actual volatility runs above implied volatility and it is decreased when actual volatility falls below implied volatility 
implied volatility tends to lag actual volatility

as part of managing our overall exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we maintain a portion of our capital in foreign currencies 
translation losses of million were recognized in the year ended december   on foreign currency balances held by our subsidiaries  compared to translation losses of million for the year ended december  a discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
commissions and execution fees 
commissions and execution fees for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  this was due to a decrease in futures volume and a decrease in options volume offset  in part  by a increase in stock share volume 
total darts for cleared and execution only customers for the year ended december  decreased to approximately  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  darts for cleared customers  ie  customers for whom we execute trades as well as clear and carry positions  remained consistent at approximately  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the number of customer accounts grew by to approximately  at december   compared to approximately  at december  average commission per dart for cleared customers  for the year ended december   increased by  to  as compared to for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the average trade sizes across the products our customers traded 
interest income and interest expense 
net interest income interest income less interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  net interest income was derived entirely from the electronic brokerage segment during the year ended december  for market making  net interest declined million from the same period last year to a net expense of million 
as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading income and our net interest income are interchangeable and depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income 
the relative interest rates during resulted in a mix of positions that produced more trading income and less interest income 
average securities borrowed decreased by  to billion and average securities loaned decreased by  to million  for the year ended december   as market making short stock positions contracted and our strong liquidity position reduced our financing needs in the securities lending markets 
customer cash balances increased by  to billion  end of period  and customer fully secured margin borrowings increased  to billion  end of period  at december   as compared to billion and billion  end of period  respectively  at december  lower interest rates had a negative effect on the net interest income we earned on customer cash balances 
the average fed funds effective rate dropped approximately to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  net interest earned in electronic brokerage decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  other income 
other income  for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in payment for order flow income received by our brokerage unit  resulting from increased options volume executed on exchanges using the make or take model  
table of contents where we do not receive payments for order flow  and the expansion of the options penny pricing program in the us  which was introduced in february and extended to options classes in march and classes in october of  under which payments for order flow are smaller on a per contract basis 
also contributing to other income was a million mark to market loss on non trading securities recognized during the year ended december  compared to million in mark to market gains on non trading securities recognized during the year ended december  and a decrease of million in liquidity rebates earned by our us market making unit 
this was partially offset by a million increase in market data fee income 
non interest expenses non interest expenses  for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  to million from million  during the year ended december  execution and clearing expenses made up and employee compensation and benefits were of non interest expenses 
as a percentage of total net revenues  non interest expenses increased to for the year ended december  from during the same period in execution and clearing 
execution and clearing expenses  for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to decreased trading volume across the futures and options markets in which the group and its customers traded as well as to a shift in volume towards products with lower execution costs or liquidity rebates 
trading volume for options and futures decreased and respectively while stock shares volume increased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits expenses  for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  this increase reflected the growth in the average number of employees to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the continued phase in of our stock incentive plan also increased employee compensation and benefits expense 
as we continue to grow  our focus on automation has allowed us to maintain a relatively small staff 
as a percentage of total net revenues  employee compensation and benefits expenses were and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to increased expenses for additional office and data center space and expenses related to the termination of an office lease 
as a percentage of total net revenues  occupancy  depreciation and amortization expenses were in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  communications 
communications expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by additional telecommunications bandwidth required to support increased trading volume at electronic exchanges and the expansion in the number of markets in which ibg llc operates 
as a percentage of total net revenues  communications expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreased expenses for legal contingencies and customer bad debts  partially offset by increased local value added and other non income tax expenses incurred by our foreign operating companies and increased advertising expenses

certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements ibg  inc may be exposed to a risk of loss not reflected in the consolidated financial statements for futures products  which represent obligations of the company to settle at contracted prices  which may require repurchase or sale in the market at prevailing prices

critical accounting policies valuation of financial instruments due to the nature of our operations  substantially all of our financial instrument assets  comprised of securities owned  securities purchased under agreements to resell  securities borrowed and receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations are carried at fair value based on published market prices and are marked to market daily  or are assets which are short term in nature such as u 
s 
government treasury bills or spot foreign exchange and are reflected at amounts approximating fair value 
similarly  all of our financial instrument liabilities that arise from securities sold but not yet purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  securities loaned and payables to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations are short term in nature and are reported at quoted market prices or at amounts approximating fair value 
our long and short positions are valued at either the last consolidated trade price or the last consolidated bid offer mid point where applicable at the close of regular trading hours  in the respective markets 
given that we manage a globally integrated market making portfolio  we have large and substantially offsetting positions in securities and commodities that trade on different exchanges that close at different times of the trading day 
as a result  there may be large and anomalous swings in the value of our positions daily and  accordingly  in our earnings in any period 
this is especially true on the last business day of each calendar quarter  although such swings tend to come back into equilibrium on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter 
contingencies our policy is to estimate and accrue for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings  to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with asc  contingencies formerly sfas no 

potential losses that might arise out of tax audits  to the extent that such losses are more likely than not  would be estimated and accrued in accordance with asc which incorporates former fin no 

significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability accrued with respect to litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses based on  among other factors  the progress of each case  our experience with and industry experience with similar cases and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
we have been from time to time subject to litigation and other legal proceedings 
as of december   we  along with certain of our subsidiaries  have been named parties to legal actions  which we and or such subsidiaries intend to defend vigorously 
although the results of legal 
table of contents actions cannot be predicted with certainty  it is the opinion of management that the resolution of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect  if any  on our business or financial condition  but may have a material impact on the results of operations for a given period 
as of december  and  reserves provided for potential losses related to litigation matters were not material 
use of estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states accounting standards 
in applying these standards  management is required to use certain assumptions and make estimates that could materially affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions  estimates and or judgments  however  are often subjective and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates  the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
these estimates are periodically reevaluated by management 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions  estimates and or judgments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
our exposures to market risks arise from assumptions built into our pricing models  equity price risk  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations  changes in interest rates which impact our variable rate debt obligations  and risks relating to the extension of margin credit to our customers 
pricing model exposure our strategy as a market maker is to calculate quotes a few seconds ahead of the market and execute small trades at tiny but favorable differentials as a result 
this is made possible by our proprietary pricing model  which continuously evaluates and monitors the risks inherent in our portfolio  assimilates market data and reevaluates the outstanding quotes in our entire portfolio each second 
certain aspects of the model rely on historical prices of securities 
if the behavior of price movements of individual securities diverges substantially from what their historical behavior would predict  we might incur trading losses 
we attempt to limit such risks by diversifying our portfolio across many different options  futures and underlying securities and avoiding concentrations of 
table of contents positions based on the same underlying security 
historically  our losses from these events have been immaterial in comparison to our annual trading profits 
foreign currency exposure as a result of our international market making activities and accumulated earnings in our foreign subsidiaries  our income and net worth is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our european operations and some of our asian operations are conducted by our swiss subsidiary  the 
the is regulated by the swiss federal banking commission as a securities dealer and its financial statements are presented in swiss francs 
accordingly  the is exposed to certain foreign exchange risks as described below the buys and sells futures contracts and securities denominated in various currencies and carries bank balances and borrows and lends such currencies in its regular course of business 
at the end of each accounting period the s assets and liabilities are translated into swiss francs for presentation in its financial statements 
the resulting gains or losses are reported as translation gain or loss in the s income statement 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  the s swiss franc balances are translated into us dollars for us gaap purposes 
the s translation gains or losses appear as such on ibg  inc s income statement  included in trading gains 
the s net worth is carried on the s books in swiss francs in accordance with swiss accounting standards 
at the end of each accounting period  the s net worth is translated at the then prevailing exchange rate into us dollars and the resulting gain or loss is reported in our consolidated statement of financial condition as other comprehensive income  which is neither an income nor an expense item in our statement of income  in accordance with us gaap 
historically  we have taken the approach of not hedging the above exposures to the us dollar  based on the notion that the cost of constantly hedging over the years would amount to more than the random impact of rate changes on our non us dollar balances 
for instance  an increase in the value of the swiss franc would be unfavorable to the earnings of the but would be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that the yearly translation gain or loss into us dollars is likely to move in the opposite direction 
in late  we began to expand our market making systems to incorporate cash forex and forex options in order to hedge our currency exposure at little or no cost 
in september  we began hedging our currency exposure throughout the day on a continuous basis 
in connection with the development of our currency hedging strategy  we have determined to base our net worth in globals 
we define global as consisting of a basket of major currencies that currently includes us dollar  euro  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar 
with the growth of our international operations  we foresee including other currencies in our definition of the global 
as our forex market making systems continue to develop  and as more exchanges trade more forex based products electronically  we expect more trading volume to flow through this system and  accordingly  we expect to be able to manage the risks in forex in the same low cost manner as we currently manage the risks of our market making in equity based products 
interest rate risk under our senior secured revolving credit facility  we have the ability to choose borrowing tenors from overnight to twelve months  which permits us to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of december  we pay our electronic brokerage customers interest based on benchmark overnight interest rates in various currencies 
in a normal rate environment  we typically invest a portion of these funds in us 
table of contents government treasury securities with maturities of up to three months 
under these circumstances  if interest rates were to increase rapidly and substantially  in increments that were not reflected in the yields on these treasury securities  our net interest income from customer deposits would decrease 
based upon investments outstanding at december   we had no exposure of this nature 
we also face the potential for reduced net interest income from customer deposits due to interest rate spread compression in a low rate environment 
due to a currently low rate environment  a decrease of us benchmark interest rates to zero  or roughly  would reduce our net interest income by approximately million on an annualized basis 
we also face substantial interest rate risk due to positions carried in our market making business to the extent that long or short stock positions may have been established for future or forward dates on options or futures contracts and the value of such positions are impacted by interest rates 
we hedge such risks by entering into interest rate futures contracts 
to the extent that these futures positions do not perfectly hedge this interest rate risk  our trading gains may be adversely affected 
the amount of such risk cannot be quantified 
dividend risk we face dividend risk in our market making business as we derive significant revenues and incur significant expenses in the form of dividend income and expense  respectively  from our substantial inventory of equity securities  and must make significant payments in lieu of dividends on short positions in securities in our portfolio 
projected future dividends are an important component of pricing equity options and other derivatives  and incorrect projections may lead to trading losses 
the amount of these risks cannot be quantified 
margin credit we extend margin credit to our customers  which is subject to various regulatory requirements 
margin credit is collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
the risks associated with margin credit increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of a liquidation 
we are also exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities  that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
we expect this kind of exposure to increase with growth in our overall business 
because we indemnify and hold harmless our clearing firms from certain liabilities or claims  the use of margin credit and short sales may expose us to significant off balance sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers fail to satisfy their obligations 
as of december   we had billion in margin credit extended to our customers 
the amount of risk to which we are exposed from the margin credit we extend to our customers and from short sale transactions by our customers is unlimited and not quantifiable as the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices 
our account level margin credit requirements meet or exceed those required by regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve 
as a matter of practice  we enforce real time margin compliance monitoring and liquidate customers positions if their equity falls below required margin requirements 
we have a comprehensive policy implemented in accordance with regulatory standards to assess and monitor the suitability of investors to engage in various trading activities 
to mitigate our risk  we also continuously monitor customer accounts to detect excessive concentration  large orders or positions  patterns of day trading and other activities that indicate increased risk to us 

table of contents our credit exposure is to a great extent mitigated by our policy of automatically evaluating each account throughout the trading day and closing out positions automatically for accounts that are found to be under margined 
while this methodology is effective in most situations  it may not be effective in situations where no liquid market exists for the relevant securities or commodities or where  for any reason  automatic liquidation for certain accounts has been disabled
