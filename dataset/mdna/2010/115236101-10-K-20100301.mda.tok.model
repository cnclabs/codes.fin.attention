part i item business 
general we are a diversified insurance agency  wholesale brokerage  insurance programs and service organization with origins dating from  headquartered in daytona beach and tampa  florida 
we market and sell to our customers insurance products and services  primarily in the property  casualty and employee benefits areas 
as an agent and broker  we do not assume underwriting risks 
instead  we provide our customers with quality  non investment insurance contracts  as well as other targeted  customized risk management products and services 
we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and by fees paid by customers for certain services 
the commission is usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured 
commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance  the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us 
in some cases  a commission is shared with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction 
we may also receive from an insurance company a profit sharing contingent commission  which is a profit sharing commission based primarily on underwriting results  but may also contain considerations for volume  growth and or retention 
fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division  which provides insurance related services  including third party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers compensation and all lines liability arenas  as well as medicare set aside services  and our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions  which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers 
the amount of our revenue from commissions and fees is a function of  among other factors  continued new business production  retention of existing customers  acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units 

table of contents as of december   our activities were conducted in locations in states as follows and one office in london  england florida kentucky massachusetts new jersey michigan missouri california oklahoma nevada new york new mexico new hampshire texas north carolina oregon georgia arizona tennessee indiana arkansas wisconsin pennsylvania connecticut hawaii washington minnesota kansas illinois montana nebraska louisiana south carolina ohio virginia delaware west virginia colorado industry overview premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting risk bearing industry has historically been cyclical  displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions 
from the mid s through  the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a soft market during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded  stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions 
the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production 
as a result of increasing loss ratios the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through  premium rates generally increased beginning in the first quarter of and continuing into during  the increases in premium rates began to moderate and  in certain lines of insurance  the premium rates decreased 
in  as general premium rates continued to moderate  the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since when hurricane andrew hit south florida 
the insured losses from the hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during during the third quarter of  the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded 
as a result of the significant losses incurred by the insurance companies from these hurricanes  the insurance premium rates in increased on coastal property  primarily in the southeastern region of the united states 
in the other regions of the united states  the insurance premium rates  in general  declined during in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in florida  as discussed below  insurance premium rates continued to decline during the to period in most of the other us regions 
during and  the home building industry in southern california  and to a lesser extent nevada  arizona and florida was especially hit hard 
we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that home building segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents 
these operations revenues were significantly impacted during through by these national economic trends 
although premium insurance rates declined during and in most lines of coverages  the rate of declines appeared to be slowing 
however  during the second half of and all of  insurable exposure units  such as sales and payroll expenditures  declined significantly due to the weakening economy  primarily in the southeast and western parts of the united states 
for  declining exposure units will most likely continue to have a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than will declining insurance premium rates 
segment information our business is divided into four reportable operating segments the retail division  the national programs division  the wholesale brokerage division  and the services division 
the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial  public entity  professional and individual customers

the services division provides clients with third party claims administration  consulting for the workers compensation insurance market  comprehensive medical utilization management services in both workers compensation and all lines liability arenas  and medicare secondary payer statute compliance related services 
the following table sets forth a summary of the commissions and fees revenue generated by each of our reportable operating segments for  and   and the percentage of our total commissions and fees revenue represented by each segment for each such period in thousands  except percentages retail division national programs division wholesale brokerage division services division other total we conduct all of our operations within the united states of america  except for one wholesale brokerage operation based in london  england that commenced business in march this operation earned million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively

in addition  the services division provides managed care services  including medical networks  case management and utilization review services  certified by the american accreditation health care commission 

table of contents employees at december   we had  full time equivalent employees 
we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their right to solicit our insured customers and employees after separation from employment with us 
the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes  judicial decisions and factual circumstances 
the majority of these agreements are at will and terminable by either party  however  the covenants not to solicit our insured customers and employees generally extend for a period of two years after cessation of employment 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union  and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
competition the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive  and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets 
competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation  quality of service and price 
a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere  particularly outside of florida 
a number of insurance companies engage in the direct sale of insurance  primarily to individuals  and do not pay commissions to third party agents and brokers 
in addition  the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business 
to date  such direct sales efforts have had little effect on our operations  primarily because our retail division is commercially rather than individually oriented 
in addition  the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate 
as a result  the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation  which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions  including competition for acquisition prospects 
regulation  licensing and agency contracts we and or our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents  brokers or third party administrators by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business 
regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 
the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities  and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting  revocation  suspension and renewal of licenses 
the possibility exists that we and or our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in  or otherwise subjected to penalties by  a particular state

table of contents item a 
risk factors we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies  which historically have varied and  as a result  have been difficult to predict 
we are primarily engaged in the insurance agency  wholesale brokerage  and insurance programs business  and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies 
commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products 
the amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies 
we do not determine insurance premiums 
premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market 
historically  property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions 
as traditional risk bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non affiliated brokers or agents such as us  those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers 
the reduction of these commission rates  along with general volatility and or declines in premiums  may significantly affect our profitability 
because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes  we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues  including whether they will significantly decline 
as a result  we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions  capital expenditures  dividend payments  loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues  and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 
the current economic conditions in the u 
s 
economy continue to affect our business 
since late  global consumer confidence has recently eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values  potential inflation  volatility in energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  high unemployment  and the stability and solvency of financial institutions  financial markets  businesses  and sovereign nations 
these concerns have slowed economic growth and resulted in a recession in the united states 
recent economic conditions have had a negative impact on our results of operations during the year ended december   due to reduced customer demand which is expected to continue for the next several fiscal quarters 
if these economic conditions continue or worsen  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including further declines in values of insurable exposure units  further declines in insurance premium rates  and the financial insolvency  or reduced ability to pay  of certain of our customers 
any of these effects could decrease our net revenue and profitability 
we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
traditionally  we have maintained cash and investment balances  including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts  at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the fdic insurance limits 
while we began in the fall of re focusing our investment and cash management strategy by moving more of our cash into non interest bearing accounts which are fdic insured until june   but not subject to any limits and money market accounts a portion of which became fdic insured in the fall of  we still maintain cash and investment balances in excess of the fdic insurance limits 
as the credit crisis persists  the financial strength of some depository institutions has diminished and this trend may continue 
if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail  our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited  and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 
our business  and therefore our results of operations and financial condition  may be adversely affected by the further disruption in the us based credit markets and by further instability of financial systems 
the recent disruption in the us based credit markets  the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies 
these conditions include significant losses  greater volatility  significantly less liquidity  widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets 
while these conditions have somewhat abated since the fall of  it is difficult to predict when these conditions will completely end and the extent to which our markets  products and business will be adversely affected 

table of contents these unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit  the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility  which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures 
continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings 
we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance 
if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties  we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us  which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business  and therefore our results of operations and financial condition  may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 
our results of operations are depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage  which depends in turn on insurance companies ability to procure reinsurance 
we have no control over these matters 
to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available  we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited 
inflation may adversely affect our business operations in the future 
given the current macroeconomic environment  it is possible that us government actions  in the form of a monetary stimulus  a fiscal stimulus  or both  to the us economy  could lead to inflationary conditions that would adversely affect our cost base  particularly resulting in an increase in our employee compensation benefits and our other operating expenses 
this may harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or cut costs enough to offset the effects of inflation in our cost base 
we are exposed to intangible asset risk  specifically  our goodwill may become impaired in the future 
as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year  we have  of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november  and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 
a further significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test 
if we were to conclude that a future write down of our goodwill is necessary  we would then record the appropriate charge  which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position 
see notes summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill to the consolidated financial statements and management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 
the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry  including our practices and arrangements  are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities 
the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements  including laws prohibiting such arrangements  and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds 
various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters 
while we cannot predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators  any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations 
further  if such resolution included a material decrease in our profit sharing contingent commissions  it would likely adversely effect our results of operations 
our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
we are subject to various actual and potential claims  lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance in the ordinary course of business 
because we often assist clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money  including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims clients may assert  errors and omissions claims against us alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question 
claimants may seek large damage awards  and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs 
such claims  lawsuits and other proceedings could  for example  include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub agents improperly failed to procure coverage  report claims on behalf of clients  provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis 
we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice  and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

table of contents while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our self insured deductibles  have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance  our business results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if  in the future  our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable  or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure 
our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies  the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 
for the year ended december   approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies 
for the year ended december   of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company 
for the year ended december   approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies 
should either of these insurance companies seek to terminate their arrangements with us  we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business  although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result 
no other insurance company accounts for or more of our total revenues 
because our business is highly concentrated in california  florida  indiana  michigan  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  texas and washington  adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 
a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california  florida  indiana  michigan  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  texas and washington 
for the years ended december   and december   we derived million or  million or and million  or  of our commissions and fees  respectively  from our operations located in these states 
we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to clients in these states 
we believe the regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states currently is no more restrictive than in other states 
the insurance business is a state regulated industry  and therefore  state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry 
because our business is concentrated in a few states  we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states 
in addition  the occurrence of adverse economic conditions  natural or other disasters  or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries  which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which  if consummated  may not be advantageous to us 
our growth strategy includes the acquisition of insurance agencies  brokers and other intermediaries 
our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired businesses into our operations  and expand into new markets requires us to implement and improve our operations  financial  and management information systems 
integrated  acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenue  profitability  or productivity comparable to our existing operations  or otherwise perform as expected 
in addition  we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities that have substantially greater resources than we do 
acquisitions also involve a number of special risks  such as diversion of management s attention  difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel  entry into unfamiliar markets  unanticipated problems or legal liabilities  and tax and accounting issues  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we recently expanded our operations internationally  which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve profitability 
in  we expanded our operations to the united kingdom 
this was the first time we have opened an office outside the united states 
in addition  we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities 
our international operations may be subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  less flexible employee relationships  which may make it difficult and expensive to terminate employees and which limits our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment ceases  
table of contents political and economic instability including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war  coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws  adverse trade policies  and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the us or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate  adverse changes in tax rates  legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices  governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws  including those relating to export and import duties  environmental policies and privacy issues 
our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 
the insurance intermediaries business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for clients and insurance companies  many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us 
because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature  this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida 
a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance  primarily to individuals  and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers 
in addition  as and to the extent that banks  securities firms and insurance companies affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation  and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry  as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly  and aggressively  offer a wider variety of financial services  including insurance  than we currently offer 
proposed tort reform legislation  if enacted  could decrease demand for liability insurance  thereby reducing our commission revenues 
legislation concerning tort reform has been considered  from time to time  in the united states congress and in several state legislatures 
among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards  including punitive damages  and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits 
enactment of these or similar provisions by congress  or by states in which we sell insurance  could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold  thereby reducing our commission revenues 
we compete in a highly regulated industry  which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 
we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business 
the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders 
the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to  among other things  licensing of entities to transact business  licensing of agents  admittance of assets  regulating premium rates  approving policy forms  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards  requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms  and restricting payment of dividends 
also  in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance  states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools  which compete directly  on a subsidized basis  with private insurance providers 
we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and certain other states 
these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive 
any such reductions  in a state in which we have substantial operations  such as florida  california or new york  could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state  or cause us to change our marketing focus 
further  state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually re examine existing laws and regulations  and such re examination may result in the enactment of insurance related laws and regulations  or the issuance of interpretations thereof  that adversely affect our business 
although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local  state and federal laws  rules and regulations  there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws  rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive 
specifically  recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years  which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

table of contents profit sharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual  which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 
we derive a portion of our revenues from profit sharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies 
profit sharing contingent commissions are special revenue sharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability  volume and or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year 
we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year 
these commissions generally have accounted for to of our previous year s total annual revenues over the last three years 
due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies  we cannot predict the payment of these profit sharing contingent commissions 
further  we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves  which affects our ability to make profit sharing calculations 
override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year 
because profit sharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues  any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 
we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that will be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry  which may adversely affect our business and operating results 
frequent technological changes  new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business 
the internet  for example  is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to clients and to facilitate business to business information exchange and transactions 
we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future 
we have not determined  however  the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require  which may result in short term  unexpected interruptions to our business  or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price and or efficiency  as we develop or implement new technologies 
quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 
our commission income including profit sharing contingent commissions and override commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production 
we do not control the factors that cause these variation 
specifically  customers demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals  new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed  and cancellations 
in addition  as discussed  we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions 
because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies  we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in one of our quarters or years until after the end of that period  which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures 
quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely effect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors  including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our future earnings  changes in securities analysts predictions regarding the short term and long term future of our industry  and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors 
our common stock s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts earnings and other expectations 
any failure to meet such expectations  even if minor  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
in the past  securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies securities 
if any such litigation is initiated against us  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the loss of any member of our senior management team could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results 
we believe that our future success partly depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel  including senior management  brokers and other key personnel 
although we operate with a decentralized management system  the loss of any of our senior managers or other key personnel  or our inability to identify  recruit and retain such personnel  could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology and or data security and or outsourcing relationships 
our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers  process claims  and timely and accurately report results to carriers 
an interruption of  or inability to  access our information technology  telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis 
if sustained or repeated  such a business interruption  system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 
computer viruses  hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches 
these increased risks  and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security  could expose us to data loss  monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 
we are taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
maintaining  protecting and enhancing these capabilities  to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards  and changing customer preferences  requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity  we could have operational disruptions  have regulatory or other legal problems  have increases in operating expenses  lose existing customers  have difficulty in attracting new customers  or suffer other adverse consequences 
our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are complete  or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected  which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses 
if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio  or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect  our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 
improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 
we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our clients confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees 
we have put in place policies  procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information  however  we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed 
disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data  resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 
further  privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate 
our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

table of contents we are subject to litigation which  if determined unfavorably to us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we are and may be subject to a number of claims  regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we cannot  and likely will not be able to  predict the outcome of these claims  actions and proceedings with certainty 
an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period 
in addition  regardless of monetary costs  these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier  client or employee relationships  or divert personnel and management resources 
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities  other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  some types of damages  like punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance 
insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion 
our inability to retain or hire qualified employees could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel 
there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees  especially in key positions 
if we are not able to successfully attract  retain and motivate our employees  our business  financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 
losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
also  if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company  some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 
in addition  we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our of our key executives 
while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 
consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 
companies that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies 
if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations  it may decrease the overall amount of work that we perform for these clients 
if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services  we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work 
the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us 
any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

table of contents healthcare reform and increased costs of current employees medical and other benefits could have a materially adverse affect on our business 
our profitability is affected by the cost of current employees medical and other benefits  as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits 
in recent years  we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of economic factors beyond our control 
although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs  there can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting future cost increases  and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 
in addition  the us house of representatives and the us senate passed separate health care reform bills late in both chambers are seeking to reconcile their bills and therefore we do not currently know the ultimate outcome of the reconciliation process or the legislation 
depending on the provisions contained in the final law  this legislation could have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events 
our operations may be subject to natural disasters or other business disruptions  which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses 
we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes including in florida  where our headquarters are located  earthquakes  power shortages  telecommunications failures  water shortages  floods  fire  extreme weather conditions  geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters 
our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits 
such coverage may not be adequate  or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms

hyatt brown  our chairman  and his family members  which include his son powell brown  our president and chief executive officer  beneficially owned approximately 
as a result  our executive officers  directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval  and our affairs and policies 
changes in the laws and regulations may increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of has required changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of that act  the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects 
compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs 
while these costs are no longer increasing  they may in fact increase in the future 
these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
likewise  these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 
from time to time new regulations are enacted  or existing requirements are changed  and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced 
we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted 
for example  as global warming issues become more prevalent  the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues 
this increasing governmental focus on global warming may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers 
this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations  as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us 
these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
due to inherent limitations  there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud  or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of a control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time  a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 
if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  and future year ends as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section requirements 
however  if our independent auditors interpret the section requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do  or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented  operated or reviewed  they may issue a report other than an unqualified opinion 
a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we are a diversified insurance agency  wholesale brokerage and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa  florida 
as an insurance intermediary  our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and  to a lesser extent  fees paid directly by customers 
commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds underlying insurable exposure units  which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values  sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured 
insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors  including reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies  none of which we control 
the volume of business from new and existing insured customers  fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues 
for example  level rates of inflation or a continuing general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units 
conversely  the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
historically  our revenues have typically grown as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 
we foster a strong  decentralized sales culture with a goal of consistent  sustained growth over the long term 
in  our senior leadership group included executive officers with regional responsibility for oversight of designated operations within the company 
in july  j 
powell brown  who serves as president of brown brown  inc  succeeded his father  j 
hyatt brown  as chief executive officer 
mr 
hyatt brown continues to serve as chairman of the board  and remains actively involved with acquisitions and recruitment 
as previously announced  jim w 
henderson  vice chairman and chief operating officer  will retire from the company in august we increased revenues every year from to however  in  our revenues declined from the prior year to million 
our revenue growth from to reflects a compound annual growth rate of 
in the same period  we increased net income from million to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
the past three years have posed significant challenges for us and for our industry in the form of a prevailing decline in insurance premium rates  commonly referred to as a soft market  increased significant governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace since  resulting in a substantial loss of revenues for us  and  beginning in the second half of and throughout  increased pressure on the values of insurable exposure units as the consequence of the general weakening of the economy in the united states 
beginning in the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of we experienced negative internal revenue growth each quarter 
this was due primarily to the soft market  and  beginning in the second half of and throughout  the decline in insurable exposure units  which further reduced our commissions and fees revenues 
part of the decline in was the result of the increased governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace  as described below in the florida insurance overview 
one industry segment that was hit especially hard during these years was the home building industry in southern california and  to a lesser extent in nevada  arizona and florida 
we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents 
these operations revenues were negatively affected by these national economic trends primarily in and  but continuing into while insurance premium rates continued to decline for most lines of coverage during  the rate of decline appears to have been less than in in  continued declining exposure units had a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than declining insurance premium rates 
even though we do not anticipate significant additional declines in exposure units or pricing in  we currently do not see any indications of improvement in these areas 
we also earn profit sharing contingent commissions  which are profit sharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results  but may also reflect considerations for volume  growth and or retention 
these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year  based on the aforementioned considerations for the prior year s 
over the last three years  profit sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately of the previous year s total commissions and fees revenue 
profit sharing contingent commissions are typically included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received 
the term core commissions and fees excludes profit sharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold  and specific fee based services rendered 
in recent years  five national insurance companies have replaced the loss ratio based profit sharing contingent commission calculation with a guaranteed fixed based methodology  referred to as guaranteed supplemental commissions gsc 
since these gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios  they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written 
as of december   we earned million from gscs during most of this total will not be collected until the first quarter of for the twelve month periods ended december  and  we earned million and million  respectively  from gscs 
fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions  which are recognized as services are rendered 
fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division  which provides insurance related services  including third party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers compensation and all lines liability arenas  as well as medicare set aside services  and our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions  which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies 
these services are provided over a period of time  typically one year 
fee revenues  as a percentage of our total commissions and fees  represented in  in and in historically  investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies 
our policy is to invest available funds in high quality  short term fixed income investment securities 
as a result of the bank liquidity and solvency issues in the united states in the last quarter of  we moved substantial amounts of our cash into non interest bearing checking accounts so that they would be fully insured by the federal depository insurance corporation fdic or into money market investment funds a portion of which recently became fdic insured of suntrust and wells fargo  two large national banks 
investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 
in  we sold our investment in rock tenn company for a net gain of million 

table of contents florida insurance overview many states have established residual markets  which are governmental or quasi governmental insurance facilities that provide coverage to individuals and or businesses that cannot buy insurance in the private marketplace  ie  insurers of last resort 
these facilities can be designed to cover any type of risk or exposure  however  the exposures most commonly subject to such facilities are automobile or high risk property exposures 
residual markets can also be referred to as fair plans  windstorm pools  joint underwriting associations  or may even be given names styled after the private sector like citizens property insurance corporation in florida 
in august  the florida legislature created citizens property insurance corporation citizens  to be the insurer of last resort in florida 
initially  citizens charged insurance rates that were higher than those generally prevailing in the private insurance marketplace 
in each of and  four major hurricanes made landfall in florida 
as a result of the ensuing significant insurance property losses  florida property insurance rates increased in to counter the increased property insurance rates  the state of florida instructed citizens to essentially reduce its property insurance rates by half beginning in january by state law  citizens guaranteed these rates through january  as a result  citizens became one of the most  if not the most  competitive risk bearers for a large percentage of florida s commercial habitational coastal property exposures  such as condominiums  apartments  and certain assisted living facilities 
additionally  citizens became the only insurance market for certain homeowner policies throughout florida 
today  citizens is one of the largest underwriters of coastal property exposures in florida 
effective january   citizens raised its insurance rates  on average  for properties with values of less than million  and more than for properties with values in excess of million 
as a result  the impact of citizens should continue to decline in in  citizens became the principal direct competitor of the insurance companies that underwrite the condominium program administered by one of our indirect subsidiaries  florida intracoastal underwriters  limited company fiu  and the excess and surplus lines insurers represented by our wholesale brokers such as hull company  inc  another of our subsidiaries 
consequently  these operations lost significant amounts of revenue to citizens 
during and  fiu s revenues were relatively flat and therefore  citizens impact was not as dramatic as in citizens continued to be competitive with the excess and surplus lines insurers  however  and therefore negatively affected the revenues of our florida based wholesale brokerage operations  such as hull company  inc  from through citizens impact on our florida retail division was less severe than on our national program and wholesale brokerage divisions  because our retail offices have the ability to place business with citizens  although at slightly lower commission rates and with greater difficulty in placing coverage 

table of contents current year company overview for the third consecutive year  we recorded negative internal revenue growth of our commissions and fees revenues as a direct result of the general weakness of the economy since the second half of and the continuing soft market 
our total commissions and fees revenues excluding the effect of recent acquisitions  profit sharing contingencies and sales of books of business over the last twelve months  had a negative internal growth rate of 
during  investment income and other income were substantially less than in and due principally to the fact that investment yields dropped significantly in each of the last two years and to the fact that we had more infrequent gain transactions in and acquisitions approximately  independent insurance agencies are estimated to currently be operating in the united states 
part of our continuing business strategy is to attract high quality insurance agencies to join our operations 
from through  we acquired insurance intermediary operations  including acquired books of business customer accounts  that had aggregate estimated annual revenues of million for the calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition 
acquisition activity slowed in in part because potential sellers were unhappy with reduced agency valuations that were the consequences of lower revenues and operating profits due to the continuing soft market and decreasing exposure units  and therefore opted to defer the sales of their insurance agencies 
a summary of our acquisitions over the last three years is as follows in millions  except for number of acquisitions number of acquisitions estimated annual revenues net cash paid notes issued liabilities assumed recorded earn out payable aggregate purchase price asset stock results of operations for the years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues core commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions investment income other income  net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock based compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december 
table of contents commissions and fees commissions and fees revenue  including profit sharing contingent commissions  decreased in  but increased in and in profit sharing contingent commissions decreased million to million in  and million to million in primarily due to higher loss ratios  and therefore  lower profitability for insurance carriers 
core commissions and fees revenue decreased in  in and in  when excluding commissions and fees revenue generated from acquired and divested operations 
the decrease of represents million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue  of which million is related to our retail  wholesale and services operations based in florida 
the decrease in our non florida retail and wholesale brokerage operations in was million  but that was substantially offset by another year of strong revenue growth of million in proctor financial  inc  a subsidiary that provides lender placed insurance coverage 
the decrease of represents million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue  of which million was related to our retail  wholesale and services operations based in florida 
the decrease in our non florida retail and wholesale brokerage operations in was million  which was substantially offset by strong revenue growth of million in proctor financial 
investment income investment income decreased to million in  compared with million in and million in the million decrease in from was primarily due to substantially lower investment yields in  even though the average daily invested balance was higher in than in the million decrease in from was primarily due to the sale of our investment in rock tenn company in for a net gain of million 
the remaining million decrease in investment income in was primarily due to lower investment yields 
other income  net other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets 
in  gains of million were recognized from sales of books of business customer accounts as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
although we are not in the business of selling books of business  we periodically will sell an office or a book of business that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth

during  the irs concluded its audit of our tax years in which it disputed our method of recognizing profit sharing contingent commissions for tax purposes 
we recognize profit sharing contingent commissions when determinable  which is when such commissions are received 
however  the irs believes that we should estimate those amounts as of each december we agreed to resolve this dispute for a million payment of interest and our agreement to accrue at each december  for tax purposes only  a known amount of profit sharing contingent commissions represented by the actual amount of profit sharing contingent commissions received in the first quarter of the related year  with a true up adjustment to the actual amount received by the following march because this method  now required for tax purposes  differs from the method used for book purposes  it will result in a current deferred tax asset as of december each year  which will be reversed by the following march  when the related profit sharing contingent commissions are recognized for financial accounting purposes

table of contents retail division the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial  public and quasi public  professional and individual insured customers

most of the negative internal growth resulted from continued competitive insurance pricing  primarily in florida 
additionally  even though there are signs that declines in insurance rates are slowing  the second half of was marked by indications of additional slowing of the economy  which resulted in a reduction in insurable exposure units 
for  the slowing economy will most likely have a greater impact on the premium volume of our customers than will the insurance premium rates

on february   million in series d senior notes due january   with a fixed interest rate of per annum were issued 
as of december  there was an outstanding balance of million under the master agreement 

table of contents on june   the company entered into an amended and restated revolving loan agreement the loan agreement with a national banking institution that was dated as of june   amending and restating the existing revolving loan agreement dated september   as amended the revolving agreement  in order to increase the lending commitment to million subject to potential increases up to million and to extend the maturity date from december  to june  the revolving agreement initially provided for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of million 
after a series of amendments that provided covenant exceptions for the notes issued or to be issued under the master agreement and relaxed or deleted certain other covenants  the maximum principal amount was reduced to million 
the calculation of interest and fees is generally based on the company s quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non cash stock based compensation 
interest is charged at a rate equal to to above the london interbank offering rate libor or below the base rate  each as more fully defined in the loan agreement 
fees include an upfront fee  an availability fee of to  and a letter of credit usage fee of to 
the loan agreement contains various covenants  limitations  and events of default customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers 
the day libor was and as of december  and  respectively 
there were no borrowings against this facility at december  or in january  brown brown entered into a million unsecured seven year term agreement with a national banking institution the term agreement  bearing an interest rate based upon the  or day libor plus to  depending upon brown brown s quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash stock based compensation 
the day libor was as of december  this loan was fully funded on january  and was to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of million through december as of december  the outstanding balance had been paid in full 
all four of these credit agreements require  or required  brown brown to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants 
brown brown was in compliance with all such covenants as of december  and neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred off balance sheet obligations through the use of  or investment in  off balance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations  partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investment portfolio and funds generated from operations  together with our master agreement and the loan agreement described above  will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of additionally  we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs  including the required annual principal payments on our long term debt 
historically  much of our cash has been used for acquisitions 
if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow  we believe that given our relatively low debt to total capitalization ratio  we would have the ability to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities  which values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer  whichever is later 
at that date  the earnings process has been completed  and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly 
management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances 
subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification concerning matters necessitating such adjustments from the insurance companies 
profit sharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable  which is when such commissions are received from insurance companies  or when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments 
fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

table of contents business combinations and purchase price allocations we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions 
these assets consist of purchased customer accounts  non compete agreements  and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill 
the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 
all of our business combinations initiated after june  have been accounted for using the purchase method 
in connection with these acquisitions  we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased  which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and non compete agreements 
purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies  customers and other matters essential to policy renewals 
however  they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts 
the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency  expenses and discount rates 
any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts 
non compete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of particular agreements 
purchased customer accounts and non compete agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods  which range from five to years 
the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized 
intangible assets impairment goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
fair value is estimated based on multiples of earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis  and assesses the recoverability of our amortizable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant negative industry or economic trends  iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and iv significant decline in our market capitalization 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above referenced factors  an impairment analysis is performed 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to revise the assessment and  if appropriate  record an impairment charge 
we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november  and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 
non cash stock based compensation the company grants stock options and non vested stock awards to its employees  which requires that the related compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
litigation claims we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
management  with the assistance of in house and outside counsel  determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues 
new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income 

table of contents derivative instruments in  we entered into one derivative financial instrument an interest rate exchange agreement  or swap to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our million variable rate debt 
as of december   we maintained this swap agreement  whereby we paid a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank paid us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base libor 
we assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge  and accordingly  changes in the fair market value of the swap were reflected in other comprehensive income 
the fair market value of this instrument was determined by quotes obtained from the related counter parties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows 
the valuation of this derivative instrument was a significant estimate that was largely affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december  this interest rate swap agreement expired in conjunction with the final payment on the related million variable rate debt 
new accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and equity prices 
we are exposed to market risk through our investments  revolving credit line and term loan agreements 
our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments  available for sale marketable equity securities  non marketable equity securities and certificates of deposit 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments  and certificates of deposit at december  and approximated their respective carrying values due to their short term duration and  therefore  such market risk is not considered to be material
