water activities the water activities segment is comprised of our core regulated water activities to supply public drinking water to our customers 
this segment encompasses all transactions of our regulated water company with the exception of certain real estate transactions 
real estate transactions our real estate transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our real estate holdings 
these transactions can be effected by any of our subsidiary companies 
through land donations and discount sales in previous years  the company earned tax credits to use in future years 
the company is limited by time and the amount of taxable income when using these credits 
each year  the company assesses its ability to use these credits going forward and makes adjustments to its valuation allowances  accordingly 
during  the company completed the sale of a conservation easement of approximately acres to the town of windsor locks  ct 
additionally  the company made adjustments to tax valuation allowances associated with land donations made in previous years 
finally  chester realty sold a non regulated rental property in killingly  ct for a small profit 
the company currently has no other specific plans for land transactions in and beyond 
during  the company did not sell any land  however  the company did make adjustments to valuation allowances for land sold in prior periods 
during  the company engaged in two land transactions totaling acres and increased its valuation allowance  resulting in a net profit of  a breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows income loss from real estate transactions from continuing operations regulated unregulated total services and rentals our services and rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties through our unregulated companies 
the types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities  linebacker  our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers  and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck 
our lease and rental income comes primarily from the renting of residential and commercial property 
linebacker is an optional service line protection program offered by the company to eligible residential and commercial customers through newus covering the cost of repairs for leaking or broken water service lines which provide the drinking water to a customer s home or business 
for customers who enroll in this program  the company will repair or replace a leaking or broken water service line  curb box  curb box cover  meter pit  meter pit cover  meter pit valve plus in home water main shut off valve before the meter 
the program does not cover non standard items such as pressure reducing valves  booster pumps  and lawn and or fire sprinkler protection systems 
the linebacker program costs per year for residential customers and per year for commercial customers 
the program has no deductible or limits on number or cost of leaks repaired each year 
as of december  and  the company had  and  customers enrolled in its linebacker protection program  respectively 
some of the services listed above  including the service line protection plan  have little or no competition 
but there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems 
however  we have sought to develop a niche market by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition 
the services and rentals segment  while still a relatively small portion of our overall business  has grown significantly over the past five years and now provides approximately of our overall net income in net income generated by this segment of our business was   and  for the years  and  respectively 
item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth below  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results 
for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  see the discussion in forward looking information in item below management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements 
because we incur significant capital expenditures annually  we depend on the rates we charge our customers 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers 
these rates are subject to approval by the dpuc 
the company is entitled to file rate increase requests  from time to time  to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses 
once a rate increase petition is filed with the dpuc  the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
we can provide no assurances that any future rate increase requests will be approved by the dpuc  including the rate application applied for on january   and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that any such rate increase requests will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
additionally  the dpuc may rule that a company must reduce its rates 
under a law  the dpuc may authorize regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism  known as a water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica  for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers 
for more information related to wica  please refer to the executive overview found in item of this form k 
if we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due  or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents  our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as of december   we had million in long term debt outstanding and million in bank loans payable 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  and  if necessary  borrowing under our existing and planned credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due 
if  however  we do not generate sufficient cash  we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity  which may be on terms that are not favorable to the company as current terms 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default on these documents  which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness 
credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt  borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt 
the credit market volatility lessened in the second half of during certain periods over the past two years  the volatility and disruption reached unprecedented levels 
in many cases  the markets contained limited credit capacity for certain issuers  and lenders had requested shorter terms 
the market for new debt financing was limited and in some cases not available at all 
in addition  the markets had increased the uncertainty that lenders will be able to comply with their previous commitments 
the company noted improvements during the second half of if market disruption and volatility return  the company may not be able to refinance our existing debt when it comes due  draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt  which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our liquidity needs or to fund our capital expenditures budget 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain our existing credit ratings could affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position 
since  standard poor s ratings services has rated our outstanding debt and has given credit ratings to us and our subsidiary the connecticut water company 
their evaluations are based on a number of factors  which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 
on august   standard poor s ratings services reaffirmed their a credit rating on the connecticut water service and the connecticut water company  both with an outlook of stable 
in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the difficult financial markets  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current strong credit ratings 
failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position 
market disruptions caused by the worldwide financial crisis could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long term commitments  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
during  the company increased its lines of credit from million to million 
we rely on our revolving credit facilities and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs 
a return to disruptions in the credit markets or further deterioration of the banking industry s financial condition  may discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments  extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments 
market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets 
our inability to comply with debt covenants under our credit facilities could result in prepayment obligations 
we are obligated to comply with debt covenants under our loan and debt agreements 
failure to comply with covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay or finance these borrowings before their due date  could limit future borrowings  and result in cross default issues and increase borrowing costs 
the covenants are normal and customary in bank and loan agreements 
the company was in compliance with the covenants at december  market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position 
as detailed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has significant obligations in these areas and the company holds significant assets in these trusts 
these assets are subject to market fluctuations  which may affect investment returns  which may fall below the company s projected return rates 
a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value 
additionally  the company s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates decrease  the liabilities increase  potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements 
further  changes in demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
also  future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers  and our the results of operations and financial position of the company could be negatively affected 
our operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our water and wastewater operations are governed by extensive federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal safe drinking water act  the clean water act and similar state laws  and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies 
these laws and regulations establish  among other things  criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the united states and or connecticut 
pursuant to these laws  we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations 
we cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently 
these laws  and the enforcement thereof  have tended to become more stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits  it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the dpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs 
in summary  we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with  or discharging liabilities under  current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
climate change laws and regulations may be adopted that could require compliance with greenhouse gas emissions standards and other climate change initiatives 
additional capital expenditures could be required and our operating costs could be increased in order to comply with new regulatory standards imposed by federal and state environmental agencies 
climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide 
many scientists  legislators  and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
possible new climate change laws and regulations  if enacted  may require us to monitor and or change our utility operations 
it is possible that new standards could be imposed that will require additional capital expenditures or raise our operating costs 
because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted  we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
although these expenditures and costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the various state public utility commissions or similar regulatory bodies that govern our business would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs 
we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with new standards or laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
new streamflow regulations could potentially impact our ability to serve our customers 
the connecticut department of environmental protection is seeking to promulgate new regulations relative to the flow of water in the state s rivers and streams and we are assessing the impact that any such regulation would have on our operations  capital requirements and our ability to serve our customers with sufficient quantities of water 
it is uncertain if the state will adopt the streamflow rule as it is currently drafted 
however  any new streamflow regulation has the potential to restrict our access to water  raise our capital and operating expenses and adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance the dpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could adversely affect demand for our water services and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 
declining per customer residential water usage may reduce our revenues  financial condition and results of operations in future years 
a trend of declining per customer residential water usage in connecticut has been observed for the last several years  which we would attribute to increased water conservation  including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users 
our regulated business is heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use 
the rate we charge for our water is regulated by the dpuc and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand 
declining volume of residential water usage may have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect any usage declines in the rate setting design process 
potential regulatory changes or drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers demand for water and our financial results 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers 
changes in regulatory requirements could affect our ability to utilize existing supplies and or secure new sources  as required 
insufficient supplies or an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
although not occurring in  drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers 
an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions  which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems 
we rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business  especially with respect to customer service and billing  accounting and  in some cases  the monitoring and operation of our treatment  storage and pumping facilities 
a loss of these systems or major problems with the operation of these systems could affect our operations and have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the failure of  or the requirement to repair  upgrade or dismantle  any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we own and operate dams throughout the state of connecticut 
while the company maintains robust dam maintenance and inspection programs  a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any failure of our reservoirs  storage tanks  mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 
connecticut water distributes water through an extensive network of mains and stores water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across connecticut 
a failure of major mains  reservoirs  or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of major mains  reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs 
such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators  including the dpuc  and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and reputation 
any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas 
since the beginning of  we have acquired five water systems 
as of the date of this filing  which includes small acquisitions completed after december   the connecticut water company now serves more than  customers  or a population of over  people  in connecticut towns 
we will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
it is our intent  when practical  to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management s time and resources 
future acquisitions by us could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting  fluctuations in quarterly results  and other acquisition related expenses 
some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements 
the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process  including in the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting  could interfere with our operations  reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 
water supply contamination may adversely affect our business 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  and possible terrorist attacks 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment 
we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
the need to increase security may continue to increase our operating costs 
in addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
we are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
the accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition 
we make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding  among others the number of years to depreciate certain assets  amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses  our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims  including medical and workers compensation claims  future costs for pensions and other post retirement benefit obligations  and  possible tax allowances 
the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs at the end of each accounting period 
if our estimates are not accurate  we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period 
key employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results

unresolved staff comments none item properties the properties of our regulated water company consist of land  easements  rights including water rights  buildings  reservoirs  standpipes  dams  wells  supply lines  treatment plants  pumping plants  transmission and distribution mains and conduits  mains and other facilities and equipment used for the collection  purification  storage and distribution of water 
in certain cases  our water company may be a party to limited contractual arrangements for the provision of water supply from neighboring utilities 
we believe that our properties are in good operating condition 
water mains are located  for the most part  in public streets and  in a few instances  are located on land that we own in fee simple and or land utilized pursuant to easement right  most of which are perpetual and adequate for the purpose for which they are held 
the net utility plant of the company at december  was solely owned by connecticut water 
connecticut water s net utility plant balance as of december  was  approximately million more than the balance of net utility plant as of december   due primarily to normal plant additions and construction spending related to infrastructure improvements 
sources of water supply owned  maintained  and operated by connecticut water include eighteen reservoirs and eighty seven well fields 
in addition  connecticut water has agreements with various neighboring water utilities to provide water  at negotiated rates  to our water systems 
collectively  these sources have the capacity to deliver approximately fifty two million gallons of potable water daily to the thirteen major operating systems in the following table 
in addition to the principal systems identified  connecticut water owns  maintains  and operates forty seven small  non interconnected satellite and consecutive water systems that  combined have the ability to deliver about two million gallons of additional water per day to their respective systems 
for some small consecutive water systems  purchased water may comprise substantially all of the total available supply of the system 
during  the company integrated the former ellington acres water system and somers system with and into the western system 
connecticut water owns and operates water filtration facilities  having a combined treatment capacity of approximately million gallons per day 
the company s estimated available water supply  including purchased water agreements  but excluding non principal systems  is as follows system estimated available supply million gallons per day chester system collinsville system danielson system gallup system guilford system naugatuck system northern western system plainfield system stafford system terryville system thomaston system thompson system unionville system total as of december   the transmission and distribution systems of connecticut water consisted of approximately  miles of main 
on that date  approximately percent of our mains were eight inch diameter or larger 
substantially all new main installations are cement lined ductile iron pipe of eight inch diameter or larger 
we believe that our properties are maintained in good condition and in accordance with current regulations and standards of good waterworks industry practice 
item legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings from time to time

in  approximately of the company s net income was attributable to the water activities of its largest subsidiary  connecticut water  a regulated water utility with  customers throughout connecticut towns  as of december  the rates charged for service by connecticut water are subject to review and approval by the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
in the mid s  connecticut water made a conscious decision to minimize its reliance on rate increase requests to drive its financial performance 
instead  it relied upon unregulated operations and cost containment to grow the earnings of the company without seeking higher rates 
after a successful extended period of meeting these objectives  it became clear in that a rate increase was needed to continue to provide shareholder value through increased earnings 
the company decided to return to the more traditional model of recurring rate increase filings to efficiently collect its cost of both annual expenses and its investment in the infrastructure of the regulated business 
in  the connecticut water communicated to its customers  regulators and shareholders that it expected to seek rate relief on a more recurring basis 
on january   the company s regulated water subsidiary  the connecticut water company  filed a rate application with the dpuc  requesting a multi year increase totaling million  over a three year period 
the company has proposed options for regulatory consideration  including a multi year phase in of rates that  if approved  would be a first in connecticut for water utilities 
in addition to the phased in rate increase  the company is also seeking a water conservation adjustment mechanism wcam  to allow the company to continue to aggressively promote water conservation in an effective manner while addressing the financial impact of increased conservation by its customers 
the wcam seeks to minimize the effects of conservation on the company s revenues through a recovery mechanism that would be limited to a change in non weather related residential sales  while at the same time allowing for the promotion of conservation to the benefit of customers and the environment  usually two opposing concerns 
in addition to the conservation efforts that have impacted sales  the need for an increase in rates is  in part  based upon an investment of approximately million in net utility plant since  the last time the company filed a general rate increase 
in addition  increased operating costs for labor  employee benefits and other general operating needs  including chemicals  is being requested 
no assurance can be given that the dpuc will approve any or all of the rate relief  the phased in approach or the wcam requested by the company 
the company expects a decision in this rate case in july  with new rates effective at that time 
over the next twenty years  the environmental protection agency expects water companies to spend over billion in infrastructure costs nationwide to ensure compliance with existing and future water regulations 
recognizing the importance of timely infrastructure replacement and improvement  the company  along with other investor owned regulated water companies in the state  campaigned for the passage of the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica act in the connecticut general assembly  which was adopted in wica allows the company to add a surcharge to customers bills  subject to an expedited review and approval by the dpuc and no more than twice a year  to reflect the replacement of certain types of aging utility plant  principally water mains  meters  service lines and water conservation related investments 
the passage of the wica legislation has helped augment the company s current strategy of seeking to collect its costs of operating the regulated utility on a timely basis through a mechanism even more efficient than a general rate filing with the dpuc 
the use of wica minimizes the regulatory lag from the time the company invests in infrastructure replacement  or certain qualified new  plant and when it can begin to recover that investment in the rates charged to customers 
on october   the company filed its infrastructure assessment report iar under wica 
the purpose of the iar is to clearly define the criteria for determining the priority of future replacement projects 
the company received approval of its iar from the dpuc on march  the company filed for a surcharge under the wica mechanism on april  on july   the company was approved to add a wica surcharge on customers bills issued on and after july  on october   the company filed its second wica application with the dpuc  requesting a surcharge to customers bills  inclusive of the surcharge approved in july the surcharges can be placed on customers bills at the start of a calendar quarter following the receipt of dpuc approval 
the dpuc approved a cumulative wica surcharge of on december  the surcharge mechanism became effective january  the company has and will continue to focus on minimizing operating costs that are passed along to its customers without sacrificing the quality service it values and the customers demand 
at the same time  the company will continue to employ its current strategy of timely collection of appropriate costs and a fair rate of return for its shareholders through appropriate rates for its regulated water service 
recognizing the economic hardship seen in connecticut over the preceding months  on april   the company filed with the dpuc an agreement negotiated by and between the company and the office of consumer counsel to accomplish three goals first  a request to equalize depreciation rates across divisions  which would lower depreciation expense  resulting in a temporary reduction of rates for all connecticut water customers  during the period july through december  secondly  an increase in allowed operation and maintenance expense equal to the of the company s previously allowed revenue requirements  effective january  finally  an extension of the stay out period such that connecticut water would not file a new general rate adjustment prior to january   which would result in new rates prior to july  the net effect of these three items was a reduction in depreciation expense  offset by a temporary rate reduction of for the last six months of  and a delay of at least six months in connecticut water s next general rate filing 
the dpuc approved the agreement on july  and the new rates took effect at that time 
effective january   the company s rates reverted to the rates that were in effect during the first half of the company prides itself on being able to help water systems that do not have the resources to deliver the best water possible to their customers 
on august   the company completed the acquisition of a small water system serving a condominium complex in the town of madison  ct that was found to have uranium levels above established standards 
by acquiring the system  the company was able to solve a problem for the condominium residents and to assist the town of madison  ct in addressing uranium found in the water of two public schools adjacent to the system 
the company has already installed the treatment system necessary to remove the uranium from the system and was able to connect to the schools prior to the start of the school year 
due to the contamination issues  the company acquired the system for a nominal fee 
the acquisition added the equivalent of approximately customers to the company 
as discussed in item  above  the company announced  in february  the acquisition of another water system with water quality issues in killingworth  ct 
in and beyond  the company will continue to look for acquisition candidates that we would easily be able to tuck in to existing service territories  as well as possible acquisitions outside of our service territories  including outside the state of connecticut 
additionally  the company plans to continue its efforts to tie in private well owners whose homes are in close proximity to our mains 
in  connecticut water added private well owners in our existing service territories 
lastly  the company will continue to work with developers to encourage public water use for new residential construction within connecticut water s service areas 
while the company plans to file timely rate cases  continue to make acquisitions and  in the future  utilize the wica adjustment to allow for more timely recovery of investment in utility plant  it will also look to newus to increase its earnings in the unregulated business 
the company will continue to seek out maintenance and service contracts with new customers and renew existing contracts that have proven to be beneficial to the company  as well as to continue the expansion of the linebacker program 
in january  newus acquired the assets of home service usa 
prior to the acquisition home service usa offered connecticut water customers coverage for failure of home plumbing and septic drainage lines 
newus agreed to purchase the right to provide the service to connecticut water customers and began offering its own comparable coverage 
as part of the agreement  home service usa will not offer its products to connecticut water customers for a period of ten years 
the new products offered by newus will be integrated into the linebacker program 
in  the company completed the sale of a conservation easement on a well field property no longer needed as a source of supply to the town of windsor locks  connecticut for million 
windsor locks was awarded a grant from the connecticut department of environmental protection to assist in purchasing the conservation easement in order to permanently protect the approximate acre property from development and guarantee public access to the land for passive recreation 
the company filed an application with the dpuc and submitted the draft agreement and the form of conservation easement to the dpuc on april  the dpuc approved the transaction on september  and the transaction closed on september  the sale of the conservation easement generated approximately million in net income for the real estate segment for the year ending december  the company currently has no other specific plans for land transactions in and beyond 
regulatory matters and inflation the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capabilities 
the cumulative effect of inflation over time results in significantly higher operating costs and facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
connecticut water s ability to recover its increased expenses and or investment in utility plant is dependent on the rates we charge our customers 
changes to these rates must be approved by the dpuc through formal rate proceedings 
due to the subjectivity of certain items involved in the process of establishing rates such as customer usage  future customer growth  inflation  and allowed return on investment  we have no assurance that we will be able to raise our rates to a level we consider appropriate  or to raise rates at all  through any future rate proceeding 
connecticut water is also subject to environmental and water quality regulations  which are continually modified and refined to ensure the safety of the company s water sources and  ultimately  the public s health 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
while there can be no guarantee that all expenditures related to increased regulation will be recoverable in rate proceedings  the company believes that the regulatory environment in connecticut would allow prudent expenditures to be recovered in rates 
to date  the company has never had any costs associated with water quality and environmental spending refused in a general rate proceeding 
the company believes that it is in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
during  the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures on safe drinking water act projects 
the company expects to spend approximately million on safe water drinking act projects in  primarily to bring newly acquired systems up to the company s standards 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and as directed by the regulatory commissions to which the company s subsidiaries are subject 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the company believes the following policies and estimates are critical to the presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
public utility regulation financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc regulated operations fasb asc  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as connecticut water to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc material regulatory assets  other than deferred revenue  are earning a return 
revenue recognition the company s accounting policies regarding revenue recognition by segment are as follows water activities most of our water customers are billed quarterly  with the exception of larger commercial and industrial customers  as well as public and private fire protection customers who are billed monthly 
most customers  except fire protection customers  are metered 
revenues from metered customers are based on their water usage multiplied by approved  regulated rates and are earned when water is delivered 
public fire protection revenues are based on the length of the water main  and number of hydrants in service and are earned on a monthly basis 
private fire protection charges are based on the diameter of the connection to the water main 
our water companies accrue an estimate for metered customers for the amount of revenues earned relating to water delivered but unbilled at the end of each quarter 
real estate transactions revenues are recorded when a sale or other transaction has been completed and title to the real estate has been transferred 
services and rentals revenues are recorded when the company has delivered the services called for by contractual obligation 
employee benefit plan accounting management evaluates the appropriateness of the discount rate through the modeling of a bond portfolio which approximates the pension and postretirement plan liabilities 
management further considers rates of high quality corporate bonds of approximate maturities as published by nationally recognized rating agencies consistent with the duration of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the discount rate assumption we use to value our pension and postretirement benefit obligations has a material impact on the amount of expense we record in a given period 
our and pension expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
our and post retirement welfare expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
in  our pension and postretirement welfare expense will be calculated using an assumed discount rate of and  respectively 
the following table shows how much a one percent change in our assumed discount rate would have changed our reported pension and postretirement expense increase decrease in pension expense increase decrease in postretirement expense increase in the discount rate decrease in the discount rate other assumptions that affect the costs associated with our benefit plans include the assumed rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation increase 
the company has a assumed an return on plan investments and a rate of compensation increase for our pension and post retirement welfare plans  in and outlook the company s earnings and profitability are primarily dependent upon the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
the company s earnings and profitability in future years will also depend upon a number of other factors  such as the ability to maintain our operating costs at current or lower levels  customer growth in the company s core regulated water utility business  growth in revenues attributable to non water sales operations  and the timing and adequacy of rate relief when requested  from time to time  by our regulated water company 
the company believes that the factors described above and those described in detail below under the heading commitments and contingencies may have significant impact  either alone or in the aggregate  on the company s earnings and profitability in fiscal years and beyond 
please also review carefully the risks and uncertainties described in item a risk factors and those described above under the heading special note regarding forward looking information 
based upon the company s need to seek a rate increase  and the timing of an increase  if granted  the company can not characterize its expectations for net income in when compared to the company will likely have the ability to better gauge its financial results at the conclusion of the rate proceeding  which is expected in the second quarter of during and subsequent years  the ability of the company to maintain and increase its net income will principally depend upon the effect on the company of the factors described above in this outlook section  those factors described in the section entitled commitments and contingencies and the risks and uncertainties described in the special note regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors

pension and post retirement contributions cannot be reasonably estimated beyond and may be impacted by such factors as return on pension assets  changes in the number of plan participants and future salary increases 
the amounts included for pension and post retirement contributions are management s best estimate  including the company s planned million pension contribution in we pay refunds on advances for construction over a specific period of time based on operating revenues related to developer installed water mains or as new customers are connected to and take service from such mains 
after all refunds are paid  any remaining balance is transferred to contributions in aid of construction 
the refund amounts are not included in the above table because the refund amounts and timing are dependent upon several variables  including new customer connections  customer consumption levels and future rate increases  which cannot be accurately estimated 
portions of these refund amounts are payable annually through and amounts not paid by the contract expiration dates become non refundable 
we intend to fund these contractual obligations with cash flows from operations and liquidity sources held by or available to us

wica charges will continue to appear on customer s bills until the company s next general rate case  including increases to wica charges between cases  while the rate reduction was eliminated on january  water production for the year ended december  decreased by 
a portion of this decline was related to lower residential demand due to the extremely wet and cool weather experienced in the second quarter of in addition  our residential customers continued the declining usage throughout industrial revenues decreased by  or  to  when compared to  primarily due to the economic downturn affecting companies in our service regions 
a portion of the decrease was due to industrial customers cutting back on shifts and other budget cuts

rate relief connecticut water is a regulated public utility  which provides water services to its customers 
the rates that regulated companies charge their water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory authority of the dpuc 
connecticut water s allowed rate of return on equity and return on rate base are and  respectively 
in june  the state of connecticut adopted legislation which permits regulated water companies to recapture money spent on eligible infrastructure improvements without a full rate case proceeding 
the dpuc may authorize regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism  such as a water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica  for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers 
regulated water companies may only charge customers such an adjustment to the extent allowed by the dpuc based on a water company s infrastructure assessment report  as approved by the dpuc and upon semiannual filings which reflect plant additions consistent with such report 
on october   the company filed its second wica application with the dpuc  requesting a surcharge to customers bills  inclusive of the surcharge approved in july the surcharges can be placed on customers bills at the start of a calendar quarter following the receipt of dpuc approval 
the dpuc approved a cumulative wica surcharge of on december  the surcharge mechanism became effective january  on january   the company s regulated water subsidiary  the connecticut water company  filed a rate application with the dpuc  requesting a multi year increase totaling million  over a three year period 
the company has proposed options for regulatory consideration  including a multi year phase in of rates that  if approved  would be a first in connecticut for water utilities 
in addition to the phased in rate increase  the company is also seeking a water conservation adjustment mechanism wcam  to allow the company to continue to aggressively promote water conservation in an effective manner while addressing the financial impact of increased conservation by its customers 
the wcam seeks to minimize the effects of conservation on the company s revenues through a recovery mechanism that would be limited to a change in non weather related residential sales  while at the same time allowing for the promotion of conservation to the benefit of customers and the environment  usually two opposing concerns 
in addition to the conservation efforts that have impacted sales  the need for an increase in rates is  in part  based upon an investment of approximately million in net utility plant since  the last time the company filed a general rate increase 
in addition  increased operating costs for labor  employee benefits and other general operating needs  including chemicals  is being requested 
no assurance can be given that the dpuc will approve any or all of the rate relief  the phased in approach or the wcam requested by the company 
the company expects a decision in this rate case in july  with new rates effective at that time

perry street litigation connecticut water s unionville division has for many years operated a well field located at perry street  farmington  connecticut  pursuant to a year lease entered into in with the property owner 
this well field provides approximately half of the daily water supply requirements to the customers of the unionville division 
in  the original property owner ceased business operations 
the property is now owned by perry street  llc  which obtained the property through a foreclosure proceeding 
in june  the new property owner commenced a lawsuit in hartford superior court housing section  asserting that connecticut water is in unlawful possession of the property under several theories  including that the lease is invalid and that connecticut water has failed to pay rent when due 
we asserted that we have a valid lease  and did not vacate the premises 
a trial before a judge was held in november  and a decision was issued on april  in its decision  the court ruled that the lease is valid 
however  in deciding the parties contentions regarding the proper form and amount of rental payments due  the court ruled that connecticut water was in breach of its obligation to pay rent on the property and therefore entered an order of eviction 
on may   connecticut water filed a timely appeal of the decision in the connecticut appellate court 
subsequently  the connecticut supreme court transferred the case to itself for determination 
on february   the connecticut supreme court issued its decision reinstating the lease and allowing connecticut water to retain possession of the premises  contingent upon the company paying the property owner all back rent  together with interest and court costs 
we have presented the property owner with our calculations as to the rent and interest due  and have requested the property owner s calculation as to court costs 
on august   connecticut water was served with a related lawsuit in which perry street  llc seeks the payment of back rent with respect to the property 
in february   the lawsuit for back rent was stayed pending the resolution of the appeal related to the eviction case 
we have been accruing rent going back to when perry street  llc became the property owner 
however  we have not yet confirmed that the property owner agrees with our calculation as to either the amount due or the time over which back rent is owed 
if the property owner does not agree with our calculation and chooses to pursue this case  we intend to vigorously defend the action for back rent as to all amounts over the amount which has been set aside 
that action notwithstanding  with the supreme court decision  the company maintains its use of the property to provide water to customers of its unionville division
