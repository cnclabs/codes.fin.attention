see note of consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that relate to estimates that require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimate or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
management s estimates are generally based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are judged to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
management believes its critical accounting policies and estimates include its allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable  merchandise inventory valuation  accounting for goodwill  and self insurance liabilities 

table of contents allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable 
the company maintains valuation allowances based upon the expected collectability of accounts and notes receivable 
the allowances include specific amounts for accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as customer bankruptcies and disputed amounts  and general allowances for accounts that may become uncollectible 
these allowances are estimated based on a number of factors  including industry trends  current economic conditions  creditworthiness of customers  age of the receivables  changes in customer payment patterns  and historical experience 
at december   the company had accounts and notes receivable of million  net of allowances of million 
an unexpected bankruptcy or other adverse change in the financial condition of a customer could result in increases in these allowances  which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
the company actively manages its accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
inventory valuation 
the company values its merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made only at the end of the year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time 
lifo calculations are required for interim reporting purposes and are based on the company s estimates of the expected mix of products in year end inventory 
in addition  inventory valuation includes estimates of allowances for obsolescence and variances between actual inventory on hand and perpetual inventory records that can arise between physical inventory dates 
these estimates are based on factors such as the age of inventory and historical trends 
at december   the carrying value of the company s inventory was million  which is million less than the value of inventory accounted for on a current cost or first in  first out fifo basis 
goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in performing the impairment test  the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using valuation techniques which can include multiples of the unit s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  present value of expected cash flows  and quoted market prices 
the ebitda multiples are based on an analysis of current market capitalizations and recent acquisition prices of similar companies  if available 
the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value to determine potential impairment 
the company s goodwill totaled million at december  the impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
the application of alternative assumptions  such as different discount rates or ebitda multiples  or the testing for impairment at a different level of organization or under a different organization structure  could produce materially different results 
self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for most employee healthcare  workers compensation and automobile liability costs  however  the company maintains insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits 
the company estimates its liabilities for healthcare costs using current and historical claims data 
liabilities for workers compensation and automobile liability claims are estimated using historical claims data and loss development factors 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of existing claims change or historical trends are not indicative of future trends  then the company may be required to record additional expense or reductions to expense that could be material to the company s financial condition and results of operations 
self insurance liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet for employee healthcare  workers compensation and automobile liability costs totaled million at december
