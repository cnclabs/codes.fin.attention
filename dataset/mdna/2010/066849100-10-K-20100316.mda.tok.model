use of non gaap financial measures certain information discussed below is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis 
specifically  included in  and interest income was   and  respectively  of tax exempt interest income from certain investment securities and loans 
an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from this tax exempt income has been added back to the interest income totals discussed in certain sections of this management s discussion and analysis  representing tax equivalent adjustments of  and in  and  respectively  which increased net interest income accordingly 
the analysis of net interest income tables included in this annual report on form k provide a reconciliation of tax equivalent financial information to the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
management believes the disclosure of tax equivalent net interest income information improves the clarity of financial analysis  and is particularly useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the changes and trends in the company s results of operations 
other financial institutions commonly present net interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
this adjustment is considered helpful in the comparison of one financial institution s net interest income to that of another institution  as each will have a different proportion of tax exempt interest from their earning asset portfolios 
moreover  net interest income is a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions  net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
for purposes of this measure as well  other financial institutions generally use tax equivalent net interest income to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution

application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully enumerated in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the reader of the financial statements should review these policies to gain a greater understanding of how the company s financial performance is reported 
management believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses allowance is a significant accounting estimate used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the allowance  which is established through a provision for loan loss expense  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated inherent risk of probable loss in the loan portfolio 
management regularly evaluates the allowance for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of collateral 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
a smaller provision for loan losses results in higher net income  and when a greater amount of provision for loan losses is necessary  the result is lower net income 
refer to part ii  item  allowance for loan losses and provision  in this annual report on form k  for further discussion and analysis concerning the allowance 
other than temporary impairments on securities one of the significant estimates related to investment securities is the evaluation of other than temporary impairments 
the evaluation of securities for other than temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition and or future prospects  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period of unrealized losses 
securities that are in an unrealized loss position  are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an other than temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors and measures 
the primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value of securities is other than temporary include a the cause of the impairment  b the financial condition  credit rating and future prospects of the issuer  c whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  d the volatility of the securities fair value  e performance indicators of the underlying assets in the security including default rates  delinquency rates  percentage of nonperforming assets  loan to collateral value ratios  third party guarantees  current levels of subordination  vintage  and geographic concentration and  f any other information and observable data considered relevant in determining whether other than temporary impairment has occurred  including the expectation of the receipt of all principal and interest due 
the company also considers whether it intends to sell the security  or whether it believes it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security  prior to recovery of cost or amortized cost 
for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows  such as private label mortgage backed securities  the company periodically updates its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
the company s best estimate of cash flows is based upon assumptions consistent with an economic recession  similar to those the company believes market participants would use 
if the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its cost or amortized cost and there has been an adverse change in timing or amount of anticipated future cash flows since the last revised estimate to the extent that the company does not expect to receive the entire amount of future contractual principal and interest  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized 
estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral 
in addition  projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral
