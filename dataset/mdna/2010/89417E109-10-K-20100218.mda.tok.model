asbestos claims and litigation the company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have attempted to expand insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the intent of insurers and policyholders 
while the company has experienced a decrease in new asbestos claims over the past several years  the company continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the company s policyholders which includes others seeking coverage under a policy  including claims against the company s policyholders by individuals who do not appear to be impaired by asbestos exposure 
factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants 
the focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years 
in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims  bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers  including the company 
the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system 
currently  in many jurisdictions  those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts  while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket 
this trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries  along with the focus on previously peripheral defendants  contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments experienced by the company 
the company s asbestos related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders  whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers 
the company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders  some of whom have filed for bankruptcy  who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage 
in these instances  policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy 
it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues 
to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder s favor and other company defenses are not successful  the company s coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders 
accordingly  although the company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits  it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims 
many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements 
because many policyholders make exaggerated demands  it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations 
settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases 
table of contents which are favorable to the company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated 
there also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement  which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the company 
as in the past  the company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities 
in addition to claims against policyholders  proceedings have been launched directly against insurers  including the company  by individuals challenging insurers conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos related bodily injuries 
the company anticipates the filing of other direct actions against insurers  including the company  in the future 
it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings  including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions 
travelers property casualty corp 
tpc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  had entered into settlement agreements  which are subject to a number of contingencies  in connection with a number of these direct action claims 
these settlement agreements had been approved by the court in connection with proceedings initiated by tpc in the johns manville bankruptcy court 
on march   the us district court for the southern district of new york substantially affirmed the bankruptcy court s orders  while vacating that portion of the bankruptcy court s orders which required all future direct actions against tpc to first be approved by the bankruptcy court before proceeding in state or federal court 
various parties appealed the district court s ruling to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
on february   the second circuit issued an opinion vacating on jurisdictional grounds the district court s approval of the bankruptcy court s order that barred the filing of certain direct action claims against tpc in the future 
tpc and certain other parties filed petitions for writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking review of the second circuit s decision 
those petitions were granted and on june   the supreme court ruled in favor of the company  reversing the second circuit s decision 
however  since the second circuit had not ruled on several additional issues principally related to procedural matters and the adequacy of notice provided to certain parties  the supreme court remanded the case to the second circuit for further proceedings on those specific issues 
oral argument before the second circuit on the remaining issues was held on october  and the parties await a ruling 
accordingly  the settlements are not yet final 
for a description of these matters  see part i item legal proceedings 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  the company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually 
among the factors which the company may consider in the course of this review are available insurance coverage  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder  limits and deductibles  an analysis of the policyholder s potential liability  the jurisdictions involved  past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims  past settlement values of similar claims  allocated claim adjustment expense  potential role of other insurance  the role  if any  of non asbestos claims or potential non asbestos claims in any resolution process  and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any  including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a product completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage  if any  for that claim 
in the third quarter of  the company completed its annual in depth asbestos claim review 
as in prior years  the review considered active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and non product liability 
the home office and field office category as defined below  which accounts for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos related claims  again experienced an overall reduction in new claim filings 
overall gross defense and indemnity costs in these categories remained at similar levels to what the company has experienced in recent years due to the continued high level of trial activity involving individuals alleging serious asbestos related injury  rather than decreasing 
table of contents slightly as the company had expected 
while there was an aggregate decrease in the number of claims received  the number of policyholders tendering asbestos claims for the first time increased from the number tendering claims for the first time in the company also noted the continuation of recent trends  which included stable payment patterns for a large proportion of policyholders  a decrease in the number of claims received  a decrease in the number of large asbestos exposures confronting the company due to additional settlement activity  continued moderate level of asbestos related bankruptcy activity  and the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants 
while the company believes that these trends indicate a reduction in the volatility associated with the company s overall asbestos exposure  there nonetheless remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims 
the company s quarterly asbestos reserve review includes an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category  as well as recent settlements  policyholder bankruptcies  judicial rulings and legislative actions 
developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office and field office and assumed reinsurance and other categories are also analyzed 
in addition  the company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience  year by year  to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations  or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity 
for certain policyholders an estimate of the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and related claim adjustment expense is determined  and for those policyholders the company calculates  by each policy year  a ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance  past ceded experience and reinsurance collections 
conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the company s evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment 
the completion of these reviews and analyses in the third quarter resulted in a million increase in the company s asbestos reserves  which was primarily driven by a slight increase in the company s assumption for projected defense costs related to a broad range of policyholders 
overall  the company s assessment of the underlying asbestos environment did not change significantly from recent periods 
the company recorded a million increase to asbestos reserves in  which was driven by a change in the estimated costs associated with litigating asbestos coverage matters and a change in estimated losses for certain individual policyholders 
the company recorded no asbestos reserve additions in net asbestos losses paid in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
asbestos payments in included the company s one time net payment of million associated with the settlement of the acands  inc matter 
approximately  and of total net paid losses in  and  respectively  related to policyholders with whom the company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the company s liability 

table of contents the company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows number of policyholders total net paid net asbestos reserves at and for the year ended december  in millions policyholders with settlement agreements home office and field office assumed reinsurance and other international total the policyholders with settlement agreements category includes structured settlements  coverage in place arrangements and  with respect to tpc  wellington accounts

included in this category are tpc s settlements of the statutory and hawaii actions and the common law claims collectively the direct action settlement 
unless the bankruptcy court s order approving the settlement is reinstated and becomes final  the direct action settlement will be voided and tpc will have no obligation to pay the amounts under the direct action settlement other than certain administrative expenses 
in that event  the reserves assigned to the settlement will be returned to tpc s unallocated asbestos reserve

wellington accounts refer to the defendants that are parties to a agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims 
many of the aspects of the wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed 
the home office and field office category relates to all other policyholders and also includes unallocated ibnr reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos related coverage litigation 
policyholders are identified for home office review based upon  among other factors a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold currently  perceived level of exposure  number of reported claims  products completed operations and potential non product exposures  size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder 
in addition to ibnr amounts contained in the reserves for home office and field office policyholders and the costs of litigating asbestos coverage matters  the company has established a reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders  new claims from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders for which there is  or may be  litigation and direct actions against the company 
the assumed reinsurance and other category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage  including various pool participations 
on january   the company and ppg industries  inc ppg  along with approximately other insurers of ppg  agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to ppg 
the tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the modified third amended plan of reorganization amended plan proposed as part of the pittsburgh corning corp 
pcc  which is owned by ppg bankruptcy proceeding 
pursuant to the proposed amended plan  which was filed on january   pcc  along with enumerated other companies including ppg as well as the company as a participating insurer  are to receive protections afforded by section g of the bankruptcy code from certain asbestos related bodily injury claims 
under the agreement in principle  the company has the option to make a series of payments over the next years totaling approximately million to the trust to be created under the amended plan  
table of contents or it may elect to make a one time discounted payment  which  as of june   would total approximately million approximately million after reinsurance 
the agreement in principle with ppg is subject to numerous contingencies  including final court approval of the amended plan  and the company has no obligation to make the settlement payment until all contingencies are satisfied 
the company s obligations under this agreement in principle are included in the unallocated asbestos ibnr reserve 
in december  the company completed the sale of unionamerica  which comprised its united kingdom based runoff insurance and reinsurance businesses

environmental claims and litigation the company continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances 
mostly  these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation 
for instance  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  enacted in and later modified  enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances 
this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action 
liability under cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties 

table of contents the company has been  and continues to be  involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims 
the company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders 
these decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the company prior to the mid s 
these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder  and the company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount 
the resolution of environmental exposures by the company generally occurs by settlement on a policyholder by policyholder basis as opposed to a claim by claim basis 
generally  the company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past  present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder 
this form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy back of policies for future environmental liability 
in addition  many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the company may have for other claims  including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims 
the company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims 
these agreements also include appropriate indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the company 
the company s general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the company s potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs 
in establishing environmental reserves  the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution  if any 
in the course of this analysis  the company generally considers the probable liability  available coverage  relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures 
in addition  the company considers the many variables presented  such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site  the allegations of environmental harm at each site  the number of sites  the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site  the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site  the nature of government enforcement activities at each site  the ownership and general use of each site  the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder  the involvement of other insurers  the potential for other available coverage  including the number of years of coverage  the role  if any  of non environmental claims or potential non environmental claims in any resolution process  and the applicable law in each jurisdiction 
conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves 
in its review of environmental reserves  the company considers past settlement payments  changing judicial and legislative trends  its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental coverage matters  the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean up actions for both on and off site waste disposal activities  the potential for adverse development  the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations  and the potential higher costs for new settlements 
the duration of the company s investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate  if any  of the value of the claim to the company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information  the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes  the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the company and the willingness of the policyholder and the company to negotiate  if appropriate  a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims 
because these factors vary from claim to claim and policyholder by policyholder  the company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim 
however  based upon the company s experience in resolving these claims  the duration may vary from months to several years 

table of contents the company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time 
these policyholders generally present smaller exposures  have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants 
further  in many instances clean up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk based site analyses and more efficient clean up technologies 
in recent years  the company had experienced a decline in both the number of new policyholders tendering claims for the first time and the number of pending lawsuits between the company and its policyholders pertaining to coverage for environmental claims 
however  during the company experienced an increase in the number of policyholders tendering claims for the first time and in the number of pending environmental related coverage actions 
in addition  the company experienced upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders 
as a result  the company increased its net environmental reserves by million in the second quarter of in  the company increased its environmental reserves by million as a result of upward development in the anticipated defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders 
in  the company increased its environmental reserves by million primarily in response to the moderation in the rate of decline in both the number of new policyholders tendering claims for the first time and the number of pending lawsuits between the company and its policyholders pertaining to coverage for environmental claims 
in december  the company completed the sale of unionamerica  which comprised its united kingdom based runoff insurance and reinsurance businesses 
included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves transferred to the purchaser were gross and net environmental reserves of million and million  respectively 
net paid losses in and were million and million  respectively 
at december   approximately of the net environmental reserve approximately million was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims  incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims 
the bulk reserve the company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in process environmental claims and the company s experience in resolving those claims 
the balance  approximately of the net environmental reserve approximately million  consists of case reserves 

table of contents the following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves at and for the year ended december  in millions beginning reserves direct ceded net incurred losses and loss expenses direct ceded net losses paid direct ceded net sale of subsidiary direct ceded net ending reserves direct ceded net uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves as a result of the processes and procedures described above  management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims at december  are appropriately established based upon known facts  current law and management s judgment 
however  the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue  and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation 
as a result  these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop 
the continuing uncertainties include  without limitation  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation  any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants  a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated  the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued  the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company s previous assessment of these claims  the number and outcome of direct actions against the company  future developments pertaining to the company s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders  whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers 
in addition  uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal  regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
this development will be affected by future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations  as well as changes in applicable legislation 
it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or  failing settlement  until the dispute is adjudicated 
this is 
table of contents particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective 
as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves  the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments 
also  see part i item  legal proceedings 
because of the uncertainties set forth above  additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves 
in addition  the company s estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change 
these additional liabilities or increases in estimates  or a range of either  cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the company s operating results in future periods 
investment portfolio the company s invested assets at december  totaled billion  of which was invested in fixed maturity and short term investments  in equity securities  in real estate and in other investments 
because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments  the company employs a conservative investment philosophy 
a significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality  liquid taxable us government  tax exempt us municipal bonds  and taxable corporate and us agency mortgage backed bonds 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  totaled billion 
the company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments  and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the company s insurance and debt obligations 
the weighted average credit quality of the company s fixed maturity portfolio  both including and excluding us treasury securities  was aa at december  and aa at december  the slight decline in the company s average credit quality rating was due to the downgrading of a monoline bond insurer during the second quarter of and the downgrading of non agency mortgage backed securities 
below investment grade securities represented and of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the downgrading of non agency mortgage backed securities and an increase in the fair value of those and other below investment grade securities also resulted in an increase to our below investment grade securities 
the average effective duration of fixed maturities and short term securities was excluding short term securities at december  and excluding short term securities at december  the decline in duration resulted from the impact of declining market yields on existing holdings of municipal bonds and mortgage backed securities which impact the assumptions related to optional pre payments and the related estimate of effective duration for callable securities  and the purchase of shorter term fixed maturities during the second half of the following table sets forth the company s combined fixed maturity investment portfolio rated using external ratings agencies or by the company when a public rating does not exist at december   in millions carrying value percent of total carrying value quality rating aaa aa a baa total investment grade below investment grade total fixed maturity investments 
table of contents included in the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  were billion of debt securities issued by foreign governments and billion of corporate fixed maturities and redeemable preferred stock

sovereign corporate securities include corporate securities that are backed by a government and include sovereign banks and securities issued under the temporary liquidity guaranty and the federal ship financing programs 
included in commercial mortgage backed securities and project loans are million of securities guaranteed by the us government and million by government sponsored enterprises 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included billion of securities which are obligations of states  municipalities and political subdivisions collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio 
the municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the united states  the district of columbia and puerto rico  and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states  cities  counties  school districts  and similar issuers 
on april   municipal securities issued by local governments within the united states were assigned a negative outlook by moody s investors service 
included in the municipal bond portfolio are billion of advance refunded or escrowed to maturity bonds 
advance refunded and escrowed to maturity bonds are bonds for which an irrevocable trust has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest 
such escrow accounts are verified as to their sufficiency by an external auditor and almost exclusively involve us treasury securities 
the following table shows the geographic distribution of the remaining billion of municipal bonds at december  which were not advance refunded or escrowed to maturity

ratings shown are the higher of the rating of the underlying issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default 
no other single state accounted for or more of the total non advance refunded or escrowed to maturity municipal bonds 
the company bases its investment decision on the credit characteristics of the municipal security  however  its municipal bond portfolio includes a number of securities that were enhanced by third party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
the downgrade during and of credit ratings of insurers of these securities resulted in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities to the underlying rating of the respective security 
of the insured municipal securities in the company s investment portfolio at december   approximately were rated at a or above  and approximately were rated at aa or above  without the benefit of insurance 
the company believes that a further loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the securities 
the average credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was aa at december  the average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was aa at december  with and without the third party insurance 
at december  and  the company held commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs  including fha project loans of million and million  respectively 
at december   approximately million of these securities  or the loans backing such securities  contained guarantees by the us government or a government sponsored enterprise and million were comprised of canadian non guaranteed securities 
the average credit rating of the million of non guaranteed securities at december  was aaa  and of those securities were issued in and prior years 
the cmbs portfolio is supported by loans that are diversified across economic sectors and geographical areas 
the company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the portfolio s relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities 

table of contents the company makes investments in residential collateralized mortgage obligations cmos that typically have high credit quality  offer good liquidity and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to us treasury securities 
the company s investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches which offer the most favorable return given the risks involved 
one significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity 
while prepayment risk either shortening or lengthening of duration and its effect on total return cannot be fully controlled  particularly when interest rates move dramatically  the investment process generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges 
the company does invest in other types of cmo tranches if a careful assessment indicates a favorable risk return tradeoff 
the company does not purchase residual interests in cmos 
at december  and  the company held cmos classified as available for sale with a fair value of billion and billion  respectively in addition to the cmbs securities of million and million  respectively  described above 
approximately and of the company s cmo holdings are guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by gnma  fnma or fhlmc at december  and  respectively 
in addition  at december  and  the company held billion and billion  respectively  of gnma  fnma  fhlmc excluding fha project loans which are included with cmbs mortgage backed pass through securities classified as available for sale 
the average credit rating of all of the above securities was aa at december   and aaa at december  the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  and included asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages with a collective fair value of million and million  respectively comprising approximately and of the company s total fixed maturity investments at december  and  respectively 
the disruption in secondary investment markets for mortgage backed securities provided the company with the opportunity to selectively acquire additional asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages at discounted prices 
the company purchased million and million of such securities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company defines sub prime mortgage backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics low fico scores  above prime interest rates  high loan to value ratios or high debt to income ratios 
alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government sponsored entity s requirements for credit score but do not meet the government sponsored entity s guidelines for documentation  property type  debt and loan to value ratios 
the average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the company was a and aa at december  and  respectively 
approximately million of the company s asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime and alternative documentation mortgages were downgraded in an additional million of such securities were placed on credit watch during approximately million of the company s asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime and alternative documentation mortgages were downgraded in the company s real estate investments include warehouses and office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly owned 
the company s other investments are primarily comprised of private equity limited partnerships  hedge funds  real estate partnerships  joint ventures  mortgage loans  venture capital through direct ownership and limited partnerships and trading securities  which are subject to more volatility than the company s fixed maturity investments 
while these asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities  in and the returns were significantly lower than in prior periods and  in the aggregate  produced negative investment income  reflecting market conditions 
at december  and  the carrying value of the company s other investments was billion and billion  respectively 
the company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income from the lending of certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time 

table of contents borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest 
this collateral is held by a third party custodian  and the company has the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing the company s securities is in default under the lending agreement 
therefore  the company does not recognize the receipt of the collateral held by the third party custodian or the obligation to return the collateral 
the loaned securities remain a recorded asset of the company 
the company accepts only cash as collateral for securities on loan and restricts the manner in which that cash is invested 
at december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  of securities on loan to others 
the company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended december   and the net unrealized investment gains losses that were included as a separate component of accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources were as follows for the year ended december  in millions fixed maturities equity securities other investments unrealized investment gains losses before tax tax expense benefit net unrealized investment gains losses at end of year net pretax unrealized investment gains totaled billion at december   compared with net pretax unrealized investment losses of million at december  the improvement in the company s net unrealized gain position at december  over the prior year is primarily attributable to the company s fixed maturity investments 
the improved valuations on these holdings reflect the changing market conditions in which included a significant narrowing of credit spreads 
net pretax unrealized investment losses totaled million at december   compared with net pretax unrealized investment gains of million at december  the net unrealized loss position at december  reflected the impact of rising interest rates on longer dated fixed maturity securities primarily due to the widening of credit spreads generally  as well as net unrealized investment losses on equity securities  which reflected current market conditions

three of the holdings were public securities whose cost basis was not anticipated to be recovered over the expected holding period 
nine holdings experienced economic deterioration characterized by less than expected revenues or a change in product 
the remaining two holdings were impaired due to the impending sale  liquidation or shutdown of the entity 
the company had a net pretax unrealized gain of billion in its fixed maturities portfolio at december   compared with a net pretax unrealized loss of million at december  in  yields on municipal fixed maturity securities declined  which increased the market value of the company s portfolio of such securities 
in addition  credit spreads narrowed on other non municipal fixed maturity securities which also resulted in an increase in the market value of those securities

catastrophe modeling the company uses various analyses and methods  including computer modeling techniques  to analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with them 
the company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events 
in making underwriting and reinsurance decisions for hurricane and earthquake exposures  the company uses third party proprietary computer modeling in an attempt to estimate the likelihood that the loss from a single event occurring in a one year timeframe will equal or exceed a particular amount 
the tables below set forth the estimated probabilities that losses from a single event occurring in a one year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the company s common equity 
for example  on the basis described below the tables  the company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the company s loss from a single us hurricane occurring in a one year timeframe would equal or exceed billion  or percent of the company s common equity at december  dollars in billions likelihood of exceedance single hurricane single earthquake in in in in  
table of contents percentage of common equity likelihood of exceedance single hurricane single earthquake in in in in  an event that has  for example  a likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a in year event 
as noted above  however  the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one year timeframe  not over a multi year timeframe 
also  because the probabilities relate to a single event  the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period  and  therefore  the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one year timeframe 
the percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing a indicated loss amounts in dollars by b total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gain loss on investments  net of taxes 
net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends 
accordingly  in the opinion of the company s management  the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis provides a useful metric for investors to understand the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the company s financial position 
the threshold loss amounts in the tables above are net of reinsurance  after tax and exclude loss adjustment expense  which historically has been less than of loss estimates 
the above threshold loss amounts reflect the most recent version of the modeling software 
the amounts for hurricanes reflect us exposures and include property exposures other than offshore energy and marine exposures  property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non property exposures 
the amounts for earthquakes reflect us and canadian exposures and include property exposures and workers compensation exposures 
the company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts 
this information in the tables is based on the company s in force portfolio and catastrophic reinsurance program as of december  catastrophe modeling requires a significant amount of judgment and a number of assumptions and relies upon inputs based on experience  science  engineering and history 
as a result  such models may fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or that are otherwise unforeseeable 
catastrophe modeling assumptions include  among others  the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event  which may prove to be materially incorrect 
consequently  catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty 
in the tables above  the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases 
in other words  in the case of a relatively more remote event eg  in  the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable 
actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount 
in addition  more than one such event could occur in any period 
moreover  the company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes  and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes  for example  floods  tornadoes and acts of terrorism 

table of contents there are no industry standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure 
accordingly  catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable 
for more information about the company s exposure to catastrophe losses  see item a risk factors catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  our financial position and or liquidity  and could adversely impact our ratings  our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance 
changing climate conditions severe weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophe and other weather related events 
some scientists believe that  in recent years  changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability  frequency and severity of natural disasters 
accordingly  if climate conditions change in the future  the company s catastrophe models may be less reliable 
the company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under risk factors in item a of this report and under outlook herein 
for example  among other things increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the company 
see risk factors catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  our financial position and or liquidity  and could adversely impact our ratings  our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance and outlook underwriting profitability 
such changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of municipal and corporate securities in which the company invests 
for example  water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of municipal bond issuers in the southwestern us and more frequent and or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the southeastern us  among other areas 
see risk factors our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material losses 
increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the company and its customers 
for example  state insurance regulation could impact the company s ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses 
if the company is unable to implement risk based pricing  modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events should those increased losses occur  its business may be adversely affected 
see risk factors catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  our financial position and or liquidity  and could adversely impact our ratings  our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance 
the full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve 
through the company s emerging issues committee and its committee on climate  energy and the environment  the company works with its business units and corporate groups as appropriate to identify and try to assess climate change related liability issues  which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate 
see risk factors the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
climate change regulation also could increase the company s customers costs of doing business 
for example  insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may  over time  increase loss exposures 
also  increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity  which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses 

table of contents the company regularly reviews emerging issues  such as changing climate conditions  to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling  as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies  coverage modifications or new products 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
reinsurance recoverables ceded reinsurance involves credit risk  except with regard to mandatory pools  and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits 
although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded  the company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts 
the company also holds collateral  including trust agreements  escrow funds and letters of credit  under certain reinsurance agreements 
the company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically 
reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition  business practices and the price of their product offerings 
after reinsurance is purchased  the company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer 
in addition  in a number of jurisdictions  particularly the european union and the united kingdom  a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer  which may be less creditworthy  without a counterparty s consent  provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and or court authority 
the company s reinsurance recoverables totaled billion at december   a decline of billion from year end  primarily reflecting various commutation agreements and collections on reinsurance recoverables  including those related to prior years hurricane losses 
the company has also entered into master security agreements with certain reinsurers 
these agreements define conditions that require the reinsurer to provide collateral 
the specific conditions and the amounts and form of collateral to be provided by these agreements vary based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the reinsurers legal structure and trading history with the company 
the following table presents the company s top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at december  in millions

included in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to structured settlements 
structured settlements comprise annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims  of which workers compensation claims comprise a significant portion 
in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant  the structured settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables as the company retains the contingent liability to the claimant 
in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments  the company would be required to make such payments

the company considers these factors in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts 
outlook the following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the company s results of operations and capital position 
premiums 
the company s earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume 
net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business  including the impact of audit premium adjustments  policy endorsements and mid term cancellations  and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies 
when business renews  the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease renewal premium change as a result of increases or decreases in rate and or insured exposures  which the company considers as a measure of units of exposure 
net written premiums from both renewal and new business  and therefore earned premiums  are impacted by competitive market conditions and general economic conditions 
the company expects retention levels the amount of expiring premium that renews  before the impact of renewal premium changes will remain high  generally consistent with recent periods  in each of its business segments 
in the business insurance and the financial  professional international insurance segments  the company expects renewal premium changes in will be similar to levels or modestly higher 
with regard to the components comprising renewal premium changes  the company expects that positive rate changes during will be largely offset by a decline in insured exposures 
in the personal insurance segment  the company expects that agency automobile renewal premium changes  while positive  will decrease slightly in from levels 
for its agency homeowners and other business  the company expects renewal premium changes in will remain generally consistent with levels 
the pricing environment for new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal rate changes  given the volume of new business relative to renewal business 
while property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive in for new business  the company believes it is well positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities as agents  brokers and customers seek to place business with high quality carriers 
in addition  the company announced in that it launched a new distribution channel that markets personal insurance products directly to consumers  which is expected to generate modest growth in premium volume for personal insurance in while economic conditions have recently improved and us gross domestic product experienced growth in the latter part of  that trend may not continue and the us economy may enter into a double dip recession 
further  if growth continues  it may be at a slow rate for an extended period of time 
in addition  other economic conditions  such as the commercial and residential real estate 
table of contents environment and employment rates  may continue to be weak 
if weak economic conditions persist or deteriorate  low levels of economic activity could impact exposure changes at renewal and our ability to write business at acceptable rates 
additionally  such low levels of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments  policy endorsements and mid term cancellations after policies are written 
all of the foregoing  in turn  could adversely impact net written premiums in since earned premiums lag net written premiums  earned premiums could be adversely impacted in and into underwriting gain loss 
the anticipated impact of competitive market conditions and general economic conditions on the company s earned premiums  as discussed above  coupled with an expected modest increase in loss costs  will likely result in modestly reduced underwriting profitability during  as compared with in addition  the company s direct to consumer initiative in the personal insurance segment  discussed above  while intended to enhance the company s long term ability to compete successfully in a consumer driven marketplace  is expected to remain unprofitable for a number of years as this book of business grows and matures 
in recent periods  the company has experienced net favorable prior year reserve development  driven by better than expected loss experience in all of the company s segments for prior loss years 
if better than expected loss experience continues  the company may recognize additional net favorable prior year reserve development in however  better than expected loss experience may not continue or may reverse  in which case the company may recognize no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods 
the ongoing review of prior year claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  or other changes in current period circumstances  may result in the company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods 
catastrophe losses are inherently unpredictable from year to year  and the company s results of operations would be adversely impacted by a significant increase in such losses in investments 
the company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high quality investment portfolio and a relatively low average effective duration 
the company s invested assets at december  totaled billion  of which was invested in fixed maturity and short term securities  with the remaining invested in equity securities  real estate  private equity limited partnerships  hedge funds  and real estate partnerships 
net investment income is a material contributor to the company s results of operations 
while investment returns are difficult to predict and inherently uncertain  in the company expects investment returns for its fixed maturity investment portfolio to be generally consistent with recent periods  and returns for its short term and non fixed maturity investment portfolios to remain challenged 
short term interest rates are expected to remain at or near historically low levels 
the company expects investment income in its non fixed maturity investment portfolio to improve from levels  which were negative 
however  if general economic conditions and or capital market conditions deteriorate in  the company could also experience a reduction in net investment income and or significant realized investment losses  including impairments 
capital position 
the company believes it has a strong capital position and expects to continue its common share repurchase program in as part of its continuing efforts to maximize shareholder value 
during  the company expects to repurchase between billion and billion of its common shares under its share repurchase authorization 
the actual amount of share repurchases may be materially less and will depend on a variety of factors  including the company s earnings  corporate and regulatory requirements  share price  catastrophe losses  strategic initiatives and other market conditions 
the company had a net after tax unrealized investment gain of billion in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  while the company does not attempt to predict future 
table of contents interest rate movements  a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and  therefore  reduce shareholders equity  and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects 
many of the statements in this outlook section are forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the company s control 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
the liquidity requirements of the company s business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations  asset maturities and income received on investments 
cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses 
the timing and amount of catastrophe claims are inherently unpredictable 
such claims increase liquidity requirements 
the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes 
additionally  the variability of asbestos related claim payments  as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation  may also result in increased liquidity requirements 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the company s future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the above sources 
at december   total cash  short term invested assets and other readily marketable securities aggregating billion were held at the holding company 
the assets held at the holding company are sufficient to meet the holding company s current liquidity requirements and are almost twice the company s target level 
these liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends and debt service 
the company intends to reduce the amount of holding company liquidity in  subject to profitability  market conditions and other factors 
the company has a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time 
the company also has a billion line of credit facility with several financial institutions that expires in the second quarter of this line of credit also backs up the company s million commercial paper program  of which million was outstanding at december  the company is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs 
the company may decide to replace the existing credit agreement with a new credit agreement of a different amount or duration  or it could decide to replace the credit facility with other alternatives 
the company currently utilizes uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately million to provide much of the capital needed to support its operations at lloyd s 
if uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future  the company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its operations at lloyd s  which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
cash flows in reflected a decline in catastrophe loss payments  a higher level of reinsurance recoveries  a reduction in the amount of contributions to the company s pension plan and lower claims and claim adjustment expense payments related to operations in runoff 
those runoff payments in included the company s one time net payment of million associated with the final settlement of asbestos claims related to acands  inc during and  the company contributed million and million  respectively  to its pension plan 

table of contents cash flows in reflected an increase in claim payments including the impact of higher catastrophe losses and the million net asbestos settlement payment related to acands  inc and a reduction in reinsurance recoveries compared with in addition  the company made a million contribution to its pension plan in no pension plan contribution was made in cash flows in reflected higher levels of collected premiums and net investment income  lower claim payments on catastrophe losses  as well as lower runoff claim payments 
cash flows from operations in benefited from significant collections on reinsurance recoverables in both years  including those related to hurricane losses  operations in runoff primarily gulf and various commutation agreements 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in tax payments in resulting from higher profitability  expenses related to increased business volume and continued expenditures to support business growth and product development  and higher interest payments 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities totaled million  million and billion in  and  respectively 
fixed maturity securities accounted for the majority of investment purchases in all three years 
net cash available for use in investing activities in was principally provided by billion of cash flows from operating activities  partially offset by billion of cash used in financing activities principally billion for common share repurchases 
in  substantially all of the billion in cash provided by operating activities was deployed for financing activities  principally for billion of common share repurchases 
the company s consolidated total investments at december  increased by billion from year end  primarily reflecting a billion pretax increase in the unrealized appreciation of investments since year end and investment purchases resulting from strong cash flows from operations  partially offset by billion of common share repurchases made during the improvement in the company s net unrealized investment gain position at december  over the prior year is primarily attributable to the company s fixed maturity investments 
the improved valuations on these holdings reflect the changing market conditions in which included a significant narrowing of credit spreads 
the company s management of the duration of the fixed maturity investment portfolio generally produces a duration that exceeds the estimated duration of the company s net insurance liabilities 
the average duration of fixed maturities and short term securities was excluding short term securities at december  and excluding short term securities at december  the decline in duration resulted from the impact of declining market yields on existing holdings of municipal bonds and mortgage backed securities which impact the assumptions related to optional pre payments and the related estimate of effective duration for callable securities  and the purchase of shorter term fixed maturities during the second half of the primary goals of the company s asset liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities  manage the interest rate risk embedded in those insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows 
generally  the expected principal and interest payments produced by the company s fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company s insurance reserves 
although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period  the substantial degree by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the expected present value of the net insurance liabilities  as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds  provide assurance of the company s ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities

since may  the company s board of directors has approved four common share repurchase authorizations  for a cumulative authorization of up to billion of shares of the company s common stock 
under these authorizations  the most recent of which totaled billion and was approved by the board of directors in october  repurchases may be made from time to time 
table of contents in the open market  pursuant to preset trading plans meeting the requirements of rule b under the securities exchange act of  in private transactions or otherwise 
the authorizations do not have a stated expiration date 
the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors  including the company s earnings  corporate and regulatory requirements  share price  catastrophe losses  strategic initiatives and other market conditions 
the following table summarizes repurchase activity in under these authorizations and remaining repurchase capacity at december  quarterly period ending number of shares purchased cost of shares repurchased average price paid per share remaining capacity under share repurchase authorization march  june  september  december  total since the inception of the repurchase authorizations in may  the company has repurchased a cumulative total of million shares for a total cost of billion  or per share  through december  in  and  the company acquired million  million and million shares  respectively  of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options

the improvement in the company s net unrealized gain position at december  over the prior year is primarily attributable to the company s fixed maturity investments 
the improved valuations on these holdings reflect the changing market conditions in which included a significant narrowing of credit spreads 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization excluding net unrealized gain loss on investments to total capitalization presented in the foregoing table 
at december  dollars in millions total capitalization excluding net unrealized gain loss on investments net unrealized gain loss on investments  net of taxes total capitalization debt to total capital ratio debt to total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain loss on investments the debt to total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain loss on investments is calculated by dividing a debt by b total capitalization excluding net unrealized investment gain loss on investments  net of taxes 
net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends 
accordingly  in the opinion of the company s management  the debt to total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the company s financial leverage position 
the company s debt to total capital ratio of at december  calculated on this basis approximated its targeted level 
line of credit agreement 
the company has a billion  five year revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on june  pursuant to covenants in the credit agreement  the company must maintain an excess of consolidated net worth over goodwill and other intangible assets of not less than billion at all times 
the company must also maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than to 
in addition  the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default  including with respect to a change in control 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants and all other covenants related to its outstanding debt instruments 
there was no amount outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  the company is evaluating its options with regard to the forthcoming expiration of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides back up liquidity for the company s million commercial paper program  of which million was outstanding at december  in december  the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of securities to replace its expiring universal shelf registration statement 
the company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering 
during  the company issued securities with a principal amount of million under the new shelf registration statement  and in  the company issued securities with a principal amount of million under the prior shelf registration statement 
share repurchase authorization 
at december   the company had billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes  as of december   the company s future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claims related payments 
the table excludes short term obligations and includes only liabilities at december  that are expected to be settled in cash 

table of contents the table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim related payments 
the amounts do not represent the exact liability  but instead represent estimates  generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques  at a given accounting date 
these estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the company s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity  frequency  legal theories of liability and other factors 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation or deflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
additionally  there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer 
the future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount including severity considerations and timing 
amount and timing are frequently estimated separately 
an estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim related payments is generally reliable only in the aggregate with some unavoidable estimation uncertainty 
the contractual obligations related to debt  operating leases  purchase obligations  long term unfunded investment commitments  estimated claims and claims related payments gross of the

represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships 
the amounts in claims and claim adjustment expenses in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses  gross of reinsurance recoverables 
the company has entered into reinsurance agreements to protect itself from potential losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept as described in note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in order to qualify for reinsurance accounting  a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk  ie  the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk 
since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer  reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses relating to the underlying reinsured contracts 
the presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance see below 
the assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities 
reinsurance agreements that do not transfer both amount and timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits in the table above 
the estimated future cash inflows from the company s reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows in millions total less than year years years after years reinsurance recoverables the company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expense on a net of reinsurance basis 
the estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows in millions total less than year years years after years claims and claim adjustment expenses  net for business underwritten by non us operations  future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on december  the amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money 
accordingly  the amounts above will differ from the company s balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet

table of contents reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount 
claims from large deductible policies represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount  net of the estimated recovery of the deductible 
the liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as contractholder payables and contractholder receivables  respectively 
most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder s escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder 
the payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within claims and claim adjustment expenses in the above table 
because the timing of the collection of the deductible contractholder receivables occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant contractholder payables  these cash flows offset each other in the table

table of contents dividend availability the company s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the states of connecticut and minnesota 
the insurance holding company laws of both states applicable to the company s subsidiaries requires notice to  and approval by  the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that  together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurer s capital and surplus as of the preceding december  or the insurer s net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation 
this declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus  as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the company s subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar  although in some instances somewhat more restrictive  limitations on the payment of dividends 
a maximum of billion is available by the end of for such dividends without prior approval of the connecticut insurance department for connecticut domiciled subsidiaries and the minnesota department of commerce for minnesota domiciled subsidiaries 
the company may choose to accelerate the timing within and or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in  which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by those insurance departments

risk based capital the naic adopted rbc requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action 
the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital higher than rbc requirements 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies 
at december   all of the company s insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action

critical accounting estimates the company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables  investment valuation and impairments  and goodwill impairments 
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves claims and claim adjustment expense reserves loss reserves represent management s estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead represent management estimates  generally utilizing actuarial expertise and 
table of contents projection techniques  at a given accounting date 
these loss reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future  based on the company s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency  expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors 
in establishing loss reserves  the company also takes into account estimated recoveries  reinsurance  salvage and subrogation 
the loss reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company 
the process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables 
these variables can be affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes  among others 
the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate 
loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity  the volume of claims  the potential severity of individual claims  the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer 
informed judgment is applied throughout the process  including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses 
the company continually refines its loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled 
the company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established 
due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates including  but not limited to  the future settlement environment  final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date 
therefore  actual paid losses  as claims are settled in the future  may be materially different in amount than current loss reserves favorable or unfavorable 
because establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established loss reserves may change 
the company reflects adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed 
there are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes 
for example  the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves 
complex factors include  but are not limited to determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind  evaluating general liability and pollution exposures  estimating additional living expenses  estimating the impact of demand surge  infrastructure disruption  fraud  the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs  and reinsurance collectibility 
the timing of a catastrophe  such as at or near the end of a reporting period  can also affect the information available to the company in estimating reserves for that reporting period 
the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge 
a portion of the company s gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation  which totaled billion at december  while the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage  plaintiffs expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties  in the opinion of the company s management  it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the company s future operating results 
see the preceding discussion of asbestos claims and litigation and environmental claims and litigation 

table of contents gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows at december  in millions case ibnr total case ibnr total general liability property commercial multi peril commercial automobile workers compensation fidelity and surety personal automobile homeowners and personal other international and other property casualty accident and health claims and claim adjustment expense reserves the amounts previously disclosed above at december  for general liability and commercial auto ibnr reserves have been increased and decreased by million  respectively  to correct a classification error at december  in addition  the amounts previously disclosed at december  for commercial multi peril case and ibnr reserves  as well as the total case and ibnr reserves  have been increased and decreased by million  respectively  to correct a classification error at december  these reclassifications had no impact on total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves reported at december  the billion decline in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since december  primarily reflected ongoing claims and claim adjustment expense activity  including losses incurred and payments  as well as favorable prior year reserve development and payments related to operations in runoff 
asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the general liability  commercial multi peril and international and other lines in the summary table 
asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately  see asbestos claims and litigation  environmental claims and litigation and uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves 
general discussion the process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data 
data on individual reported claims  both current and historical  including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates  are grouped by common characteristics components and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line 
such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate 
the process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis  generally quarterly  in light of continually updated information 
multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities 
each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages  with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time 
therefore  the actual choice of estimation method s can change with each 
table of contents evaluation 
the estimation method s chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated 
in most cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated 
this will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability 
the company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable  given subsequent information 
reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews 
these reviews may substantiate the validity of management s recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate 
the exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature  as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable 
as a result  the company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies 
in addition  potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process 
property casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims made or on an occurrence basis 
claims made policies generally cover  subject to requirements in individual policies  claims reported during the policy period 
policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period  even if the insured reports the loss many years later 
most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis 
these policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance 
the occurrence form  which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures  is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability  including construction defect 
occurrence based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends  including future inflation and judicial interpretations and societal litigation dynamics  among others 
a basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future  absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below 
to the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known  such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and  if available and when appropriate  external data 
such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated 
significant structural changes to the available data  product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process 
informed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process 
this includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses 
in addition to actuaries  experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers  as well as other company management 
therefore  management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of loss reserves 
it is also likely that during periods of significant change  such as a merger  consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult 
the variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line  depending on the length of the claim tail  the reporting lag  the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line 
product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail  based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims 
short tail claims are reported and settled quickly  resulting in less estimation variability 
the longer the 
table of contents time before final claim resolution  the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty 
a major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag 
the reporting lag  which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer  makes estimating ibnr inherently more uncertain 
in addition  the greater the reporting lag  the greater the proportion of ibnr to the total claim liability for the product line 
writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years worth of ibnr claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable  thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products 
the most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims 
for some lines  the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis 
these lines are generally referred to as being low frequency high severity  while lines without this large claim sensitivity are referred to as high frequency low severity 
estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims 
as a result  the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates 
in contrast  for high frequency low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable 
claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate  the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process  and the ability to gain an understanding of the data 
product lines with greater claim complexity  such as for certain surety and construction exposures  have inherently greater estimation uncertainty 
actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves 
the human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty 
different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty  based on their individual backgrounds  professional experiences and areas of focus 
hence  the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other 
lastly  significant structural changes to the available data  product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process 
events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time  until stable trends re establish themselves within the new organization 
risk factors the major causes of material uncertainty risk factors generally will vary for each product line  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line 
in a few cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method  but in most cases  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  causing actual paid losses  as claims are settled in the future  to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one product line 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components 
the effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases 
for example  estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated 
table of contents with potential court rulings  but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors 
the evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts  sometimes in unanticipated ways 
for example  the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region 
while some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction  others are more evolutionary 
evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values  with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately  in stepwise fashion 
the final impact is not known until all steps have occurred 
sudden changes generally cause a one time shift in claim liability estimates  although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact 
evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates  as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable 
actuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves the principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the company s actuaries are the paid development method  the case incurred development method  the bornhuetter ferguson bf method  and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method 
the bf method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods  with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible 
these are typically referred to as traditional actuarial methods 
see glossary for an explanation of these methods 
while these are the principal methods utilized throughout the company  actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession 
the company s actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates 
some components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component 
in such cases  the company s actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims 
the reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the traditional methods described above 
the reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods  such as estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods  adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available 
utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims  combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates 
this monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates 
utilizing historic longer term average ratios of large claims to small claims  and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from traditional analysis 
ground up analysis of the underlying exposure typically used for asbestos and environmental 
the results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests  including paid to incurred loss ratios  implied incurred loss to earned premium ratios and non zero claim severity trends 
an actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss 
table of contents development to expected development based on the prior review 
additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics  including the investigation of other actuarial methods 
the methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management s existing estimate for prior accident periods 
for the initial estimate of the current accident year  the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication 
hence  the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method  which uses the earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio 
the projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior periods experience  using loss trend  rate level differences  mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years 
the exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component  based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate 
management s estimates at least once per quarter  certain company management meets with its actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses 
based on these analyses  management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed 
in doing so  it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability 
for example  as described above  payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims 
the resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
the overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform 
this is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated  which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available 
it may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the company s estimated claim liabilities 
the final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data  adjusted to reflect any new actionable information 
the audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety  and annually reviews the process by which the company establishes reserves 
discussion of product lines the following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line 
there are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs 
each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves 
also  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
for example  in workers compensation  the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster  thereby lowering indemnity costs 
thus  in almost all cases  it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation 
in order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line  the historical changes in year end loss reserves over a one year period are provided for the us product lines 
this information is provided for both the company and the industry for the nine most recent years  and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line s that most closely match the individual product line being discussed 
these changes were calculated  net of reinsurance  
table of contents from statutory annual statement data found in schedule p of those statements  and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning of the year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities  all accident years combined  excluding non defense related claim adjustment expense 
data presented for the company includes history for the entire travelers group us companies only  whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of spc or tpc 
this treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for schedule p 
comparable data for non us companies is not available 
general liability general liability is generally considered a long tail line  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided  the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self insured retentions 
there are numerous components underlying the general liability product line 
some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within to years  while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims eg  a reporting lag of a decade or more for construction defect claims 
while the majority of general liability coverages are written on an occurrence basis  certain general liability coverages such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability are typically insured on a claims made basis 
general liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components primary and excess umbrella  with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage 
bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder s legal obligation arising from non intentional acts such as negligence  subject to the insurance policy provisions 
in some cases the damages can include future wage loss which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation and future medical treatment costs 
property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant s private property arising from the policyholder s legal obligation for non intentional acts 
in most cases  property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date  or soon thereafter 
in addition  sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately 
these exposures include asbestos  environmental  other mass torts  construction defect  medical malpractice and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis 
these unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on traditional actuarial methods 
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant  sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims 
for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim 
such defense within the limits policies are most common for claims made products 
when defense costs are outside of the limits  amounts paid for defense costs do not erode the policy limits 
this line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the united states excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk 
major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag ie  the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim  the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action  whether the event triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods  the potential dollars involved in the individual claim actions  whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written ie  coverage dispute potential  and the potential for mass claim actions 
claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk 
this is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature  particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years  hence involving 
table of contents multiple defendants and their insurers and reinsurers and multiple policies thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity 
claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag ie  the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and or latent claim exposure 
the amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line 
the components in this product line with the longest latency  longest reporting lags  largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental 
components that include latency  reporting lag and or complexity issues  but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental  include construction defect  medical malpractice and other mass tort actions 
many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components 
in general  policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags  fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations  only one policy potentially triggered per claim  fewer potential settlement dollars  reasonably foreseeable and stable potential hazards claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics 
in addition to the traditional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section  the company utilizes various report year development and s curve methods for the construction defect components of this product line 
the construction defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for ibnr claim counts 
for components with greater lags in claim reporting  such as excess and umbrella components of this product line  the company relies more heavily on the bf method than on the paid and case incurred development methods 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required general liability reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include general liability risk factors changes in claim handling philosophies changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions new theories of liability trends in jury awards changes in the propensity to sue  in general with specificity to particular issues changes in statutes of limitations changes in the underlying court system distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues changes in tort law shifts in law suit mix between federal and state courts changes in claim adjuster office structure causing distortions in the data changes in settlement patterns eg  medical malpractice general liability book of business risk factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements changes in underwriting standards product mix eg  size of account  industries insured  jurisdiction mix unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves 
as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability excluding asbestos and environmental  a increase decrease in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a increase decrease in loss reserves 
historically  the one year change in the reserve estimate for this product line  excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts  over the last nine years has varied from to averaging 
table of contents for the company and from to averaging for the industry overall 
the company s year to year changes are driven by  and are based on  observed events during the year 
because the high end of the company s range of historical adverse development comes from certain businesses that the company has since exited  the company believes that the industry s range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one year changes in reserve estimates for this product line 
general liability reserves excluding asbestos and environmental represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line  excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts  was for  for and for the and changes primarily reflected significant favorable prior year reserve development  driven by several factors  including improved legal and judicial environments  as well as enhanced risk control  underwriting and claim process initiatives 
the change was driven by better than expected loss development for recent accident years attributable to several factors  including improved legal and judicial environments  as well as enhanced risk control  underwriting and claim process initiatives 
property property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages  and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process except for more complex business interruption claims 
it is generally viewed as a moderate frequency  low to moderate severity line  except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties 
the claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk  except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims 
property reserves are typically analyzed in two components  one for catastrophic or other large single events  and another for all other events 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required property reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include property risk factors physical concentration of policyholders availability and cost of local contractors for the more severe catastrophic events  demand surge inflation  which refers to significant short term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services local building codes amount of time to return property to full usage for business interruption claims court interpretation of policy provisions such as occurrence definition  or wind versus flooding lags in reporting claims eg  winter damage to summer homes  hidden damage after an earthquake court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations property book of business risk factors policy provisions mix eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements changes in underwriting standards unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves 
as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property  a increase decrease in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a increase decrease in loss reserves 
historically  the one year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from to averaging for the company  and from to 
table of contents averaging for the industry overall 
the company s year to year changes are driven by  and are based on  observed events during the year 
because the high end of the company s range of historical adverse development comes from certain businesses that the company has since exited  the company believes that the industry s range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one year changes in reserve estimates for this product line 
property reserves represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
while property is considered a short tail coverage  the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines 
this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year  which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines 
this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year  and generally are not completely resolved until the following year 
reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve 
the reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for unprecedented significant catastrophes such as the events of september  and hurricane katrina 
the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line was for  for and for the change was primarily driven by better than expected loss development in the and accident years for certain large national property and inland marine exposures 
in addition  the accident year experience improved due to the litigation environment relating to  and ongoing claim settlements for  hurricane katrina 
the change was primarily driven by favorable development in the accident year for certain large property  national programs and ocean marine claim exposures  and improvements in the litigation environment relating to  and ongoing claim settlements for  hurricane katrina 
the change was due to fewer than expected late reported claims related to non catastrophe weather events that occurred late in as well as better than expected frequency and severity due in part to changes in the marketplace  such as higher deductibles and lower policy limits 
in addition  the property product line experienced better than expected large loss outcomes which were partially attributable to favorable litigation resolutions 
commercial multi peril commercial multi peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
for property coverage  it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims  while for the other coverages  generally for the liability coverages  it takes a longer period of time to close claims 
the reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product  except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses 
the reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer 
commercial multi peril is generally sold to smaller sized accounts  while the customer profile for general liability and property includes larger customers

commercial automobile the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage property claims and property damage liability claims 
the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims 
in general  claim reporting lags are minor  claim complexity is not a major issue  and the line is viewed as high frequency  low to moderate severity 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk 
commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components bodily injury liability  property damage liability  collision claims  and comprehensive claims

workers compensation workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year 
while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly  some other payments are made over the course of several years  such as awards for permanent partial injuries 
in addition  some payments can run as long as the injured worker s life  such as permanent disability benefits and on going medical care 
despite the possibility of long payment tails  the reporting lags are generally short  settlements are generally not complex  and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity 
the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency  high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker s injury 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk 
workers compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components indemnity losses  medical losses and claim adjustment expenses 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required workers compensation reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include indemnity risk factors time required to recover from the injury degree of available transitional jobs degree of legal involvement changes in the interpretations and processes of the workers compensation commissions oversight of claims future wage inflation for states that index benefits changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds these are administrative bodies that evaluate whether or not a given claim for workers compensation benefits is valid

the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line was in  for and for fidelity and surety fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage 
it takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity claims 
the volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured  the size and complexity of the insured s business operations  amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage 
the uncertainty surrounding reserves for small  commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions 
the high frequency  low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates whereas  the low frequency  high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes 
actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency  high severity policies 

table of contents surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags  although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail  based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured 
large construction projects can take many years to complete 
the frequency of losses in surety correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of the company s insureds to perform financially 
the volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured  the type of bonded obligation  the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses  such as unbilled contract funds  collateral  first and third party indemnity  and other security positions of an insured s assets 
certain classes of surety claims are very high severity  low frequency in nature 
these can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large  complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures 
other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured eg  salvage and subrogation efforts and the results of financial restructuring of an insured

homeowners and personal lines other homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage 
most payments are related to the property portion of the policy  where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer 
claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs  although delays of several months are not unusual 
the claim is settled when the two parties agree on the amount due in accordance with the policy contract language and the appropriate payment is made or alternatively  the property replacement repair is performed by the insurer 
the resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term  although exceptions do exist 
the liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation  but with generally small reporting lags 
in addition  reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future 
overall  the line is generally high frequency  low to moderate severity except for catastrophes  with simple to moderate claim complexity 
homeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components non catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required homeowners reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include non catastrophe risk factors salvage opportunities amount of time to return property to residential use changes in weather patterns local building codes litigation trends trends in jury awards catastrophe risk factors physical concentration of policyholders availability and cost of local contractors local building codes quality of construction of damaged homes amount of time to return property to residential use for the more severe catastrophic events  demand surge inflation  which refers to significant short term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services

the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one year changes in reserve estimates for this product line 
homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
this line combines both liability and property coverages  however  the majority of the reserves relate to property 
while property is considered a short tail coverage  the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines 
this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year  which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines 
this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year  and generally are not completely resolved until the following year 
reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve 
the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line was for  for and for the change primarily reflected favorable loss experience related to hurricanes ike and katrina  as well as the california wildfires 
the change was primarily driven by favorable loss experience related to hurricane katrina  by claim initiatives  by better than expected outcomes on catastrophe related claims and by improvements in older accident years for the umbrella line 
the change was due to fewer than expected late reported claims related to non catastrophe weather events that occurred in the fourth quarter of in addition  a portion of the change was attributable to a decrease in the number of claims due to changes in the marketplace  including higher deductibles and fewer small dollar claims 
international and other international and other includes products written by international and other products not discussed above 
the principal component of other claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess of loss basis  which may include reinsurance of non us exposures  and is runoff business 
international and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages  currencies and jurisdictions countries 
the common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component  and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the us statutory reporting framework 
due to changes in the business mix for this line over time  the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved  eg  the republic of ireland and the united kingdom  while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail eg  eg excess liabilities reinsured through the london market  and several underwriting pools in runoff 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the 
table of contents specific coverage provided  the jurisdiction  the distribution system eg  underwriting pool versus direct and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard eg  insured and insurer located in different countries 
in particular  liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags  settlement lags and claim complexity  due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co insurers through a broker or lead insurer for claim settlement purposes 
international and other reserves are generally analyzed by program pool  country and general coverage category eg  eg liability excess of loss reinsurance  or general liability municipalities by country 
the business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage jurisdiction 
where the underlying insured hazard is outside the united states  the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the general liability and automobile discussion above  but under a different legal system 
where the underlying hazard is within the us  the coverage involved is typically that of general liability  but on an excess or excess of loss reinsurance basis 
excess exposure requires the insured to prove not only claims under the policy  but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy s attachment point 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required international and other reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include international and other risk factors changes in claim handling procedures  including those of the primary carriers changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision new theories of liability trends in jury awards changes in the propensity to sue changes in statutes of limitations changes in the underlying court system distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues changes in tort law changes in claim adjuster office structure causing distortions in the data international and other book of business risk factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements  claims made language changes in underwriting standards product mix eg  size of account  industries insured  jurisdiction mix unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves

international and other reserves excluding asbestos and environmental represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
international and other represents a combination of different product lines  some of which are in runoff 
comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the us do not file us statutory reports

table of contents reinsurance recoverables amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability 
the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  the company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers 
some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company s rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements 
the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes 
the reinsurance agreements that the company entered into as part of its catastrophe bond programs are dual trigger contracts and meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts 
the company s catastrophe bond programs are described in more detail in the catastrophe reinsurance coverage section herein 
the company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
the allowance is based upon the company s ongoing review of amounts outstanding  length of collection periods  changes in reinsurer credit standing  disputes  applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors 
accordingly  the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates 
from time to time  as a result of the long tailed nature of the underlying liabilities  coverage complexities and potential for disputes  the company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts 
changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges 
recoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims  of which workers compensation claims comprise a significant portion  for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities 
recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers compensation service business 
these recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company s voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant 
in the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool s or association s obligations  the other members share of such obligation increases proportionally

table of contents investment valuation and impairments fair value measurements the company s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance 
the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation  gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets  and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the company s significant market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severities  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect the company s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use 
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable  unrelated willing parties  ie  not in a forced transaction 
the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale  eg  a forced transaction 
additionally  the valuation of fixed maturity investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs  which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur 
for investments that have quoted market prices in active markets  the company uses the quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
the company receives the quoted market prices from a third party  nationally recognized pricing service pricing service 
when quoted market prices are unavailable  the company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value  which is mainly used for its fixed maturity investments 
the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
if quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable  the company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques  which  depending on the level of observable market inputs  will render the fair value estimate as level or level the company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm s length transaction 
fixed maturities the company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately of its fixed maturities 
the pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
since fixed maturities other than us treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis  the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value 
table of contents measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications  which include available relevant market information  benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing 
additionally  the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information  relevant credit information  perceived market movements and sector news 
the market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation  listed in the approximate order of priority  include benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic events 
the extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions 
depending on the security  the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant 
for some securities  additional inputs may be necessary 
the pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation 
if the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment  the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make assumptions for market based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions 
the fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes 
accordingly  the estimates of fair value for such fixed maturities  other than us treasury securities  provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
the estimated fair value of us treasury securities is included in the amount disclosed in level as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices 
the company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the company s knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market 
the company produces a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 
the company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value 
in addition  the company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation stale price review 
the company also uses an additional independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service s valuation of the company s fixed maturity portfolio 
these processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service 
the company holds privately placed corporate bonds and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates  credit spreads and liquidity 
the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the us treasury curve are the merrill lynch us corporate index and the merrill lynch high yield bb rated index 
the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in level  since all significant inputs are market observable 
as many of these securities are issued by public companies  the company compares the estimates of fair value to the fair values of these companies publicly traded debt to test the validity of the internal pricing matrix 
while the vast majority of the company s municipal bonds are included in level  the company holds a small number of municipal bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation 
due to the limited amount of observable market information  the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level additionally  the company holds a small amount of fixed maturities that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing 
for these fixed maturities  the company obtains a quote from a broker typically a market 
table of contents maker 
due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only  the company includes these fair value estimates in level equities public common and preferred for public common and preferred stocks  the company receives prices from a nationally recognized pricing service that are based on observable market transactions and includes these estimates in the amount disclosed in level infrequently  current market quotes in active markets are unavailable for certain non redeemable preferred stocks held by the company 
in these instances  the company receives an estimate of fair value from the pricing service that provides fair value estimates for the company s fixed maturities 
the service utilizes some of the same methodologies to price the non redeemable preferred stocks as it does for the fixed maturities 
the company includes the fair value estimate for these non redeemable preferred stocks in the amount disclosed in level other investments common stock with transfer restrictions and other the company holds one public common stock with transfer restrictions  with a fair value of million 
at december   the fair value of this common stock was determined by adjusting the observed market price of the security for a liquidity discount which takes into consideration the restriction on the common stock that existed at december  and is based on market observable inputs 
as a result of adjusting the market price to consider the transfer restriction  the company discloses this security in level the company holds investments in non public common and preferred equity securities  with a fair value estimate of million at december   reported in other investments  where the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an external fund manager based on recent filings  operating results  balance sheet stability  growth and other business and market sector fundamentals 
due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations  the company includes the total fair value estimate for all of these investments at december  in the amount disclosed in level the company holds investments in various publicly traded securities which are reported in other investments 
the million fair value of these investments at december  is disclosed in level these investments include securities in the company s trading portfolio million  mutual funds million and other small holdings million 
derivatives the company holds non public warrants in a public company and has convertible bonds containing embedded conversion options that are valued separately from the host bond contract 
the company estimates fair value for the warrants using an option pricing model with observable market inputs 
because the warrants are not market traded and information concerning market participants is not available  the company includes the fair value estimate of million at december  in the amount disclosed in level other investments 
the valuation of the warrants is comprised of two components the intrinsic value ie  the difference between the warrant strike price and the current share price of the underlying stock and a modeled value that represents the additional price that a market participant would be willing to pay to purchase the warrants based on the remaining time to the warrants expiration  the volatility of the underlying stock  expected dividends and current interest rates 
the estimated fair value at december   of million was comprised of million of intrinsic value and million of modeled value 
while the value of both components will change as a result of changes in the fair value of the underlying stock  the modeled value will eventually decrease to zero as the expiration date of the warrants  which is november   is approached

the company believes that there is insignificant credit risk in its short term portfolio and that amortized cost approximates fair value 
the company includes short term securities in its impairment monitoring to identify any credit issues 
real estate real estate is recorded on the purchase date at the purchase price  which generally represents fair value  and is supported by internal analysis or external appraisals  using discounted cash flow analyses and other acceptable valuation techniques 
real estate held for investment purposes is subsequently carried at the company s cost  less accumulated depreciation 
other investments the company s investment portfolio includes other investments not carried at fair value which include private equity limited partnerships  hedge funds  real estate partnerships together  partnerships and mortgage loans 
the company uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in partnerships  and amortized cost is used for mortgage loans 
the partnerships and the hedge funds generally report investments on their balance sheet at fair value 
the financial statements prepared by the investee are received by the company on a lag basis  with the lag period generally dependent upon the type of underlying investments 
the private equity and real estate partnerships provide financial information quarterly which is generally available to investors  including the company  within three to six months following the date of the reporting period 
the hedge funds provide financial information monthly  which is generally available to investors within one month following the date of the reporting period 
the company regularly requests financial information from the partnerships prior to the receipt of the partnerships financial statements  and records any material information obtained from these requests in the financial statements 
investment impairments the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other than temporary impairments 
some of the factors considered in identifying other than temporary impairments include for fixed maturity investments  whether the company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value  for non fixed maturity investments  the company s ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities ie  whether there is a credit loss  or cost for equity securities  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities  and the financial condition  near term and long term prospects for the issuer  including the relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices 
reporting of other than temporary impairments for fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value  
table of contents the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains losses 
the impairment related to all other factors is reported in accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources 
for non fixed maturity investments and fixed maturity investments the company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value  the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains losses 
upon recognizing an other than temporary impairment  the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other than temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains losses 
the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value  however  for fixed maturity investments  the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment 
due to the subjective nature of the company s analysis and estimates of future cash flows  along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis  it is possible that the company could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer 
additionally  it is possible that the issuer s actual ability to meet contractual obligations may be different than what the company determined during its analysis  which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods 
determination of credit loss the company determines the credit loss component of fixed maturity investments by utilizing discounted cash flow modeling to determine the present value of the security and comparing the present value with the amortized cost of the security 
if the amortized cost is greater than the present value of the expected cash flows  the difference is considered a credit loss and recognized in net realized investment gains losses 
for non structured fixed maturities us treasury securities  obligations of us government and government agencies and authorities  obligations of states  municipalities and political subdivisions  debt securities issued by foreign governments and certain corporate debt the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery time frame and assessing whether further principal and interest will be received 
the determination of recovery value incorporates an issuer valuation assumption utilizing one or a combination of valuation methods as deemed appropriate by the company 
the company determines the undiscounted recovery value by allocating the estimated value of the issuer to the company s assessment of the priority of claims 
the present value of the cash flows is determined by applying the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment and an estimated recovery time frame 
generally  that time frame for securities for which the issuer is in bankruptcy is months 
for securities for which the issuer is financially troubled but not in bankruptcy  that time frame is generally months 
included in the present value calculation are expected principal and interest payments  however  for securities for which the issuer is classified as bankrupt or in default  the present value calculation assumes no interest payments and a single recovery amount 
in estimating the recovery value  significant judgment is involved in the development of assumptions relating to a myriad of factors related to the issuer including  but not limited to  revenue  margin and earnings projections  the likely market or liquidation values of assets  potential additional debt to be incurred pre or post bankruptcy restructuring  the ability to shift existing or new debt to different priority layers  the amount of restructuring bankruptcy expenses  the size and priority of 
table of contents unfunded pension obligations  litigation or other contingent claims  the treatment of intercompany claims and the likely outcome with respect to inter creditor conflicts 
for structured fixed maturity securities primarily residential and commercial mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and pass through securities  the company estimates the present value of the security by projecting future cash flows of the assets underlying the securitization  allocating the flows to the various tranches based on the structure of the securitization  and determining the present value of the cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows 
the company incorporates levels of delinquencies  defaults and severities as well as credit attributes of the remaining assets in the securitization  along with other economic data  to arrive at its best estimate of the parameters applied to the assets underlying the securitization 
in order to project cash flows  the following assumptions are applied to the assets underlying the securitization voluntary prepayment rates  default rates and loss severity 
the key assumptions made for the prime  alt a and sub prime mortgage backed securities at december  were as follows at december  prime alt a sub prime voluntary prepayment rates percentage of remaining pool liquidated due to defaults loss severity changes in intent to sell temporarily impaired assets the company may  from time to time  sell invested assets subsequent to the balance sheet date that it did not intend to sell at the balance sheet date 
conversely  the company may not sell invested assets that it asserted that it intended to sell at the balance sheet date 
such changes in intent are generally due to events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date 
the types of events that may result in a change in intent include  but are not limited to  significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances related to the invested asset eg  a downgrade or upgrade from a rating agency  significant unforeseen changes in liquidity needs  or changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment 
real estate investments on at least an annual basis  the company obtains independent appraisals for substantially all of its real estate investments 
in addition  the carrying value of all real estate property is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the review for impairment considers the valuation from the independent appraisal  when applicable  and incorporates an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate property 
an impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real estate property 
the impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
other investments investments in private equity limited partnerships  hedge funds and real estate partnerships the company reviews these investments for impairment no less frequently than quarterly and monitors the performance throughout the year through discussions with the managers general partners 
if the company becomes aware of an impairment of a partnership s investments at the balance sheet date prior to receiving the partnership s financial statements  it will recognize an impairment by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the partnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income 

table of contents mortgage loans a mortgage loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect principal and interest amounts due 
for mortgage loans that are determined to be impaired  a reserve is established for the difference between the amortized cost and the fair market value of the underlying collateral 
in estimating fair value  the company uses interest rates reflecting the current real estate financing market returns 
the company did not have any impaired mortgage loans at december  and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments the company performs a review  on at least an annual basis  of goodwill held by the reporting units which are the company s three operating and reportable segments business insurance  financial  professional international insurance  and personal insurance 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to their carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying values of the reporting units exceed their fair value  the amount of the impairment is calculated and goodwill is adjusted accordingly 
in the fourth quarter of  the company changed its methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units from a multiple of earnings model to a discounted cash flow model 
this change was made as a result of the effects of a severe disruption of the credit and equity markets and significant changes in the insurance industry that caused disparities between the multiple of earnings of the company and the observed multiple of earnings of its competitors 
the discounted cash flow model is an income approach to valuation that is based on a more detailed analysis for deriving a current fair value of reporting units and is more representative of the company s reporting units current and expected future financial performance 
the change in methodology resulted in a change in estimate of the fair value of the reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
other indefinite lived intangible assets held by the company are also reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the classification of the asset as indefinite lived is reassessed  and an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives 
the carrying amount of intangible assets with a finite useful life is regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment in value 
impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates inclusive of credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of december  the company s 
table of contents market risk sensitive instruments  including derivatives  are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading 
the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio at december  and was billion and billion  respectively  of which and was invested in fixed maturity securities  respectively 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
the company has no direct commodity risk and is not a party to any credit default swaps 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  and included asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages with a collective fair value of million and million  respectively comprising approximately and of the company s total fixed maturity investments  respectively 
the disruption in secondary investment markets for mortgage backed securities provided the company with the opportunity to selectively acquire additional asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages at discounted prices 
the company purchased million and million of such securities in and  respectively 
the company defines sub prime mortgage backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics low fico scores  above prime interest rates  high loan to value ratios or high debt to income ratios 
alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government sponsored entity s requirements for credit score but do not meet the government sponsored entity s guidelines for documentation  property type  debt and loan to value ratios 
the average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the company was a and aa at december  and  respectively 
approximately million and million of asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime and alternative documentation mortgages were downgraded in and  respectively 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included securities issued by numerous states  municipalities and political subdivisions collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio  a number of which were enhanced by third party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
the downgrade of credit ratings of insurers of these securities has resulted in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities to the underlying rating of the respective security 
of the insured municipal bond portfolio  approximately were rated at a or above  and approximately were rated at aa or above  without the benefit of insurance 
the company believes  based on current market conditions  that a further loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the securities 
the average credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was aa at december  the average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was aa at december  with and without the third party insurance and includes pre funded and escrowed to maturity securities  as well as securities issued without third party insurance 
on april   municipal securities issued by local governments within the united states were assigned a negative outlook by moody s investors service 
notwithstanding the relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations  during an economic downturn  the company s municipal bond portfolio could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue 
the prolonged economic downturn that began in has resulted in many states and local governments operating under deficits or projected deficits 
the severity and duration of these deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of the company s municipal bond portfolio 
in addition  some issuers have been unable or may be unwilling to increase tax revenue  or to reduce spending  to fund maturing municipal bonds 

table of contents the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate and credit risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions 
the company s tax exempt fixed maturity investment portfolio totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
federal and or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or improve some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company and result in an adverse or favorable impact on the value of these holdings 
the primary market risk for all of the company s debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing 
the company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach 
for additional information regarding the company s debt see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements as well as the liquidity and capital resources section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the company s invested assets and insurance reserves denominated in foreign currencies 
cash flows from the company s foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies 
the company purchases these investments primarily to fund insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency  effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
invested assets denominated in the british pound sterling comprised approximately and of the total invested assets at december  and  respectively 
invested assets denominated in the canadian dollar comprised approximately of the total invested assets at december  and invested assets denominated in other currencies at december  and were not material 
there were no other significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
interest rate risk in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading fixed maturities  non redeemable preferred stocks  mortgage loans  short term securities  debt and derivative financial instruments 
the primary market risk to the company s market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk inclusive of credit spreads 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 

table of contents for invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk  estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel increase in interest rates 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
durations on tax exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the us treasury curve 
fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued interest  using holdings as of december  and for debt  the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical december  and ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a basis point change  comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices  and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately billion and billion based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  and  respectively 
the loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging interest rate trends 
in addition  the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments 
a hypothetical reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings 
the company s analysis indicates that a hypothetical reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively
