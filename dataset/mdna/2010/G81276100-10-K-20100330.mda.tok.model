exchange translation impact the average exchange rate is used to prepare the income statement and is calculated from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales of the uk division 
this means that results are particularly impacted by movements in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year  with the exchange rate in the first three weeks of december having the largest effect on the average exchange rate used 
a movement in the year to date exchange rate from that in the prior quarter in a particular fiscal year  will result in that quarter s results being impacted by adjustments to sales and costs in prior quarters to reflect the changed year to date exchange rate 
this can have a particularly noticeable impact on signet s results for the third quarter as the results for the third quarter are close to break even 
in addition  as the uk division s selling  administrative and general expenses are spread more evenly between quarters than its sales  these expenses can be particularly impacted in the fourth quarter 
in fiscal  it is anticipated a one cent movement in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would impact income before income tax by approximately million 

table of contents overview the key drivers of operating profitability are sales performance  achieved gross merchandising margin  level of expenses  balance between the change in same store sales and sales from new store space  and movements in the us dollar to pound sterling exchange rate  as about of signet s sales and about of operating income  including unallocated costs  are generated in the uk and signet reports its results in us dollars 
these are discussed more fully below 
sales sales performance in both the us and uk divisions is driven by the change in same store sales and contribution from changes in net store space 
same store sales are a function of the number of units sold and the average selling price of those units 
the average selling price can alter due to changes in the buying patterns of consumers or due to price changes 
for example  historically signet s customers had been purchasing larger  higher quality diamonds  which had lifted the average selling price 
however  in the second half of fiscal and in fiscal  the challenging economic environment resulted in the typical consumer buying items with a lower average selling price 
in early fiscal  a new pricing architecture was implemented which resulted in a higher average selling price in both the us and uk divisions to reflect the increase in the cost of merchandise  primarily due to the higher cost of gold 
further price increases were implemented by the uk division in fiscal such price increases usually result in an initial reduction in the number of units sold followed by a recovery in volumes  but not to the prior level  all other factors being constant 
a new store typically has sales of about that of a five year old store  and will only contribute to sales for part of the fiscal year in which it is opened 
store openings are usually planned to occur in the third quarter and store closures in january 
when investing in new space  management has stringent operating and financial criteria 
due to the very challenging economic environment  us net space decreased by in fiscal and a broadly similar decline is anticipated in fiscal this is in contrast to net space growth in the us of in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the majority of the historic space growth reflected expansion of the jared format 
in the uk  there was a decline in space of in fiscal  a increase in fiscal and a decline in fiscal typically there is a small decline in uk space as the h 
samuel chain withdraws from smaller sized retail markets  and there are very limited new space opportunities for either h 
samuel or ernest jones to offset these closures 
a decline in space is planned by the uk division in fiscal net change in store space us uk signet planned fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal in fiscal  total sales fell to  million fiscal  million  down by on a reported basis and up by at constant exchange rates  non gaap measure  see item same store sales decreased by 
table of contents and net change in store space contributed to sales

in the fourth quarter total sales increased to  million fiscal  million  up by on a reported basis and by at constant exchange rates  non gaap measure  see item same store sales increased by and net change in store space had an adverse impact of 
cost of sales cost of sales  which is used to arrive at gross profit  takes into account all costs incurred in the purchase  processing and distribution of the merchandise  all costs directly incurred in the operation and support of the retail outlets as well as the net provision for uncollectible receivables 
the classification of distribution and selling costs varies from retailer to retailer and few retailers have in house customer finance programs 
therefore signet s gross profit percentage may not be directly comparable to other retailers 
gross merchandise margin the gross merchandise margin is the difference between the selling price achieved and the cost of merchandise sold expressed as a percentage of the sales price 
in retail jewelry  the gross merchandise margin percentage is above the average for specialty retailers  reflecting the slow inventory turn 
gross merchandise margin dollars is the difference expressed in monetary terms 
the trend in gross merchandise margin depends on signet s pricing policy  movements in the cost of goods sold  changes in sales mix and the direct cost of providing services such as repairs 
in early fiscal  management increased prices in both the us and the uk 
further price increases were implemented in the uk in fiscal in general  the gross merchandise margin of gold jewelry is above that of diamond jewelry  whilst that of watches and gift products is normally below that of diamond jewelry 
within the diamond jewelry category  the gross merchandise margin varies depending on the proportion of the merchandise cost accounted for by the value of the diamonds  the greater the proportion  the lower the gross merchandise margin 
in addition  the gross merchandise margin of a jared store is slightly below the mall brands  although at maturity the store contribution percentage of a jared site is similar to that of a mall store 
the gross merchandise margin of differentiated merchandise is usually a little above average for that product category  while that of a value item is a little below average 
a change in merchandise mix will therefore have an impact on the us and uk division s gross merchandise margin and a change in the proportion of sales from jared will have an impact on the gross merchandise margin of both the us division and signet as a whole 
in the us division  until fiscal  the growth of jared  the increase in sales of higher value diamonds both of which had been helping to drive same store sales growth  and higher commodity costs meant that the us gross merchandise margin showed a small decline in most years 
since fiscal  the gross merchandise margin has increased as these trends reversed 
commodity costs important factors that impact gross merchandise margin are the cost of polished diamonds and gold 
in the us  about of the cost of merchandise sold is accounted for by polished diamonds and about is accounted for by gold 
in the uk  diamonds and gold account for about and respectively of the cost of merchandise sold  and watches for about 
the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate also has a material impact as a significant proportion of the merchandise sold in the uk is purchased in us dollars 
signet uses gold and currency hedges to reduce its exposure to market volatility in the cost of gold and the pound sterling to dollar exchange rate  but does not do so for polished diamonds 
for gold  the hedging period is normally a maximum of one year 
for currencies  the hedging period can extend to months  although the majority of hedge contracts will normally be for a maximum of months 
the price of diamonds varies depending on their size  cut  color and clarity 
the price of diamonds of the size and quality typically purchased by signet showed little variation over the fiscal years  and due to the sharp decline in demand for diamonds in the second half of fiscal  particularly in the us which 
table of contents accounts for about of worldwide diamond demand source idex online idex  the supply chain became overstocked with diamonds 
combined with the reduced levels of credit availability  the oversupply of diamonds resulted in a fall in the price of loose polished diamonds of all sizes and qualities for most of fiscal the idex global diamond price index is an independent source that tracks diamond prices in the idex inventory database 
while idex tracks price movements in its database they are not representative of all transactions in polished diamonds and do not necessarily reflect prices paid by signet 
idex reports show that the price of diamonds over three carats  which is larger than signet usually purchases  are more volatile than for sizes and qualities that are typically used in merchandise sold by signet 
in the final quarter of fiscal  polished diamond prices increased a little  but remained below fiscal levels 
demand for diamonds is primarily driven by the manufacture and sale of diamond jewelry and their future price is uncertain 
the cost of gold has steadily increased during the last three fiscal years  primarily reflecting increased investment demand rather than changes in the usage for jewelry manufacture 
during fiscal  the cost of gold increased from an average of per troy ounce in february to  per troy ounce in january since the start of fiscal the cost of gold has been volatile  but has averaged above the  level 
the future price of gold is uncertain 
signet uses an average cost inventory methodology and therefore the impact of movements in the cost of diamonds and gold on gross merchandise margin is smoothed 
in addition  as jewelry inventory turns slowly  the impact takes some time to be fully reflected in the gross merchandise margin 
as inventory turn is faster in the fourth quarter than in the other three quarters  changes in the cost of merchandise are more quickly reflected in the gross merchandise margin in that quarter 
furthermore the hedging activities result in movements in the purchase cost of merchandise taking sometime before being reflected in the gross merchandise margin 
operating income margin to maintain the operating income margin  signet needs to achieve same store sales growth sufficient to offset any adverse movement in gross merchandise margin  any increase in operating costs including the net bad debt charge and the impact of any immature selling space 
same store sales growth above the level required to offset the factors outlined above  allows the business to achieve leverage of its fixed cost base and improve operating income margin 
slower sales growth or a sales decline would normally result in a reduced operating income margin 
in exceptional cases  such as through the us division s cost saving measures implemented in fiscal and described below  signet may be able to reduce costs enough to increase operating margin 
a key factor in driving operating income margin is the level of average sales per store  with higher productivity allowing leverage of expenses incurred in performing store and central functions 
therefore a slower rate of net new space growth is beneficial to operating income margin while an acceleration in growth is adverse 
the impact on operating income of a sharp  unexpected increase or decrease in same store sales performance is marked 
this is particularly so when it occurs in the fourth quarter 
however  the impact on operating income of short term sales variances either adverse or favorable is less in the us division than the uk  as certain variable expenses such as sales related rent and staff incentives account for a higher proportion of costs in the us division than in the uk division 
in the medium term  there is more opportunity to adjust costs to the changed sales level  but the time taken to do so varies depending on the type of cost 
an example of where it can take a number of months to adjust costs is expenditure on national network television advertising in the us  where signet makes most of its commitments for the year ahead during its second quarter 
it is even more difficult to reduce base lease costs in the short or medium term  as leases in us malls are typically for ten years  jared sites for years and in the uk for five plus years 
the operating margin may also be impacted by significant  unusual and non recurring items 
for example  in fiscal  the vacation entitlement policy in the us division was changed  see page for details 
this resulted in the selling  general and administrative costs being reduced while operating income increased by million  this benefit will not be repeated in subsequent years

the balance of the first quarter  and the second quarter saw same store sales down between and 
spending by higher income consumers was particularly weak in the first half  and this was reflected in the performance of jared

gross merchandise margin rate was in line with management s expectations at the start of fiscal and increased by basis points compared to fiscal there was a broadly neutral impact from commodity costs  with lower diamond prices offsetting a higher cost of gold 
the growth in differentiated merchandise was balanced by higher sales of value items 
a lower average selling price  the growth in sales by kay and price increases implemented in the first quarter of fiscal were beneficial 
in the fourth quarter  a decline of basis points in gross merchandise margin reflected a planned increase of more promotional value items in the sales mix 
a million cost saving program was an important initiative in fiscal prompt action was taken at the start of the year to realign the cost base to the lower level of sales  without weakening the division s competitive position 
store staff hours and divisional head office staffing levels were both reduced 
the million target was slightly exceeded and some of the additional savings were reinvested in national television advertising in the fourth quarter 
the net change in space had little impact on expenses in fiscal the cost reduction program more than offset the combined effect of cost inflation and an adverse net bad debt performance  delivering a net positive impact of basis points to us operating margin from expenses 
as part of the cost reduction program  it was planned that the ratio of gross marketing spend to sales should be realigned to a range typical of the period before fiscal  that is to  from in fiscal however  as a result of a better than anticipated performance in fourth quarter sales  the ratio was 
marketing expenditure was concentrated on the most productive channels and brands  that is national television advertising for kay and jared  and direct marketing for all brands

despite a broadly stable pound sterling cost base  there was a negative impact of basis points on the operating margin due to sales deleverage as a result of the decline in same store sales 
the cost base was a little higher than originally targeted  as additional property closure expenses were incurred in the fourth quarter 
while uk management undertook a cost reduction exercise  there was less opportunity to reduce costs than in the us division as a similar review had already occurred in the uk in fiscal in addition  inflationary cost pressures were greater in the uk than in the us from property rental expenses and pension costs

this reflected the movement in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate  as well as a foreign exchange gain more than offsetting an underlying increase in costs 
goodwill impairment historically management undertook an annual goodwill impairment test at its year end or when there was a triggering event 
in fiscal  in addition to the annual impairment review  there were a number of triggering events in the fourth quarter due to a significant decline in profitability reflecting the impact of the economic downturn on operations  and the even greater decline in its share price resulting in a substantial discount of the market capitalization to net tangible asset value that is  shareholders funds excluding intangible assets 
an evaluation of the recorded goodwill was undertaken and it was determined that it was impaired 
accordingly  to reflect the impairment  signet recorded a non cash charge of million  which eliminated the value of goodwill on its balance sheet 
see critical accounting policies starting on page for further details 
the goodwill write off had no impact on borrowing agreements or the net tangible assets of signet

table of contents overview managements s objective is to maintain a strong balance sheet  as it regards financial stability as a competitive advantage 
another important factor in determining financial stability is liquidity  or access to cash 
in the current challenging economic environment these two factors take on additional importance 
operating activities provide the primary source of cash and are influenced by a number of factors  such as net income  which is primarily influenced by sales and operating income margins  changes in the level of inventory  proportion of us sales made using in house customer financing programs and the average monthly collection rate of the credit balances  seasonal pattern of trading  and working capital movements associated with changes in store space 
other sources of cash are increased borrowings or the issuance of common shares for cash 
impact of new store openings on cash flow when analyzing cash flow  management believes it is important to distinguish between cash flows of the existing business and discretionary expenditures related to new store space 
as there is very limited potential to open new stores in the uk  this relates to new store space in the us 
therefore working capital investment and capital expenditure related to new us store space is separately identified in the following discussion 
in fiscal  one of signet s financial objectives was to achieve positive free cash flow of between million and million  non gaap measure  see item during the year  cash and cash equivalents increased by million fiscal million and debt decreased by million fiscal increase million 
the achieved decrease in net debt was therefore million fiscal million 
net debt at january  was million january  million  non gaap measure  see item gearing at january  was january   non gaap measure  see item the peak level of net debt in fiscal was about million fiscal about million 
cash flow from operating activities as a retail business  signet receives cash when it makes a sale to a customer or when the payment has been processed by the relevant bank if the payment is made by credit or debit card 
in the us division  where the customer makes use of financing provided by signet  the cash is received over a period of time 
in fiscal  fiscal of the us division s sales were made using finance provided by signet 
the average monthly collection rate from the credit portfolio was fiscal 
signet typically pays for merchandise about days after receipt 
due to the nature of specialty retail jewelry  it is usual for inventory to be held on average for approximately months before it is sold 
in addition  signet  holds consignment inventory  nearly all of which is in the us  which at january  amounted to million january  million 
the principal terms of the consignment agreement  which can generally be terminated by either party  are such that signet can return any or all of the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalties 
when signet sells consignment inventory  it becomes liable to the supplier for the cost of the item 
the sale of any such inventory is accounted for on a gross basis see principal accounting policies  item 
signet s largest class of operating expense relates to staff costs 
these are typically paid on a weekly  two weekly or monthly basis  with annual bonus payments also being made 
operating lease payments in respect of stores occupied are normally paid on a monthly basis by the us division and on a quarterly basis by the uk division 

table of contents payment for advertising on television  radio or in newspapers is usually made between and days after the advertisement appears 
other expenses have various payment terms  none of which are material 
adjustments to reconcile net income loss to cash flow provided by operations the major adjustment to reconcile net income loss to cash flow provided by operations is normally depreciation of property  plant and equipment 
there can also be significant  unusual and non recurring items  such as the million impairment of goodwill in fiscal in fiscal  net income adjusted for non cash items increased to million fiscal million  non gaap measure  see item the adjustments for non cash items were million fiscal million  with depreciation and amortization being million fiscal million 
the decrease in depreciation reflected the planned reduction in space growth and store refurbishment as well as the impact of foreign exchange movements on the reported figure for the uk division 
changes in operating assets and liabilities signet s working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonal nature of sales and movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate 
the working capital needs of the business are normally relatively stable from january to august 
as inventory is purchased for the fourth quarter  there is a working capital outflow which reaches its highest levels in mid to late november 
the peak level of working capital can be accentuated by new store openings 
the working capital position then reverses over the key selling period of december 
the change in inventory and receivables in the us division is primarily driven by the sales performance of the existing stores and the net change in store space 
the value of inventory in the uk division is also impacted by movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate 
growth or decline in same store sales will normally result in a smaller proportionate movement in inventory than in same store sales 
changes in the sourcing practices and merchandise mix of the business can also result in changes in inventory 
for example  the cessation of the initiative to directly source rough diamonds in late fiscal reduced working capital requirements as did the growth in fiscal of differentiated merchandise ranges  which have a faster average merchandise turn 
in the us  a change in receivables would proportionately reflect changes in sales if credit participation levels remain the same and receivable collection rates were unaltered 
changes in credit participation and the collection rate also impact the level of receivables 
movements in deferred revenue reflect the level of us sales and the attachment rate of warranty sales 
therefore if sales increase  working capital would be expected to increase 
similarly  a decrease in sales would be expected to result in a reduction in working capital 
investment in new space requires significant investment in working capital  as well as fixed capital investment  due to the slow inventory turn  and the additional investment required to fund sales in the us utilizing in house customer finance 
of the total investment required to open a new store  between and is typically accounted for by working capital 
new stores are usually opened in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
a reduction in the number of store openings results in the difference between the level of net debt in the first half of a fiscal year and the peak level being lower  while an increase in the number of store openings would have the opposite impact 
in line with signet s financial objectives for fiscal  there was an inflow from operating assets and liabilities of million fiscal outflow of million 
due to the seasonal trading pattern  the cash inflow from operating assets and liabilities was million in the fourth quarter fourth quarter fiscal outflow of million 
there was a decrease in inventory of million fiscal million  following a realignment to a lower level of sales and the much reduced space growth in the us division 
the level of accounts receivable rose by million reflecting the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the us division 

table of contents the adverse impact of exchange rate changes on currency swaps was million fiscal million 
signet historically swapped significant amounts of pound sterling deposits and inter company balances into us dollars on a short term basis to reduce the level of us dollar debt 
these cash and inter company balances  the size of which fluctuated during the year  reflected an historic restriction on dividend payments by the uk division  which was lifted in the fourth quarter of fiscal  following a ruling by the high court of justice of england and wales 
as a result  signet greatly increased its ability to reduce the size of its pounds sterling deposits and inter company balances on a permanent basis by paying dividends up through the corporate structure 
this enabled signet to meaningfully reduce its cash flow exposure to changes in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate 
in fiscal  investment in inventory and receivables associated with us space growth was reduced by million to million fiscal million reflecting only seven new mall stores and seven new jared locations fiscal mall stores and jared locations 
of the working capital investment of million in new us space in fiscal  was for inventory and million related to customer financing fiscal million and million respectively 
an inflow from inventory and repayment of customer financing arose from us store closures that occurred in calendar in the uk division  the change in net store space was not significant 
the following tables provide a summary of movement in inventory and account receivables as a result of new space growth in the us and the performance of the rest of signet s operations for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal million million million increase in inventories due to new space in us other decrease increase in inventories total decrease increase in inventories fiscal fiscal fiscal million million million increase in accounts receivable due to new space in us other increase decrease in accounts receivable total increase decrease in accounts receivable investing activities investment activities primarily reflect the purchases of property  plant and equipment related to the rate of space expansion in the us  number of store refurbishment and relocation carried out  and provision of divisional head offices  which include its us and uk distribution facilities 
in addition  purchases of intangible assets  primarily of information technology for use in the business  are also made 
when appraising a store investment  management uses an investment hurdle rate of a internal rate of return on a pre tax basis over a five year period assuming the release of working capital at the end of the five years 
capital expenditure accounts for about of the investment in a new jared store and for about of the investment in a mall store 
the balance is accounted for by investment in inventory and the funding of customer financing 
signet typically carries out a major refurbishment of its stores every ten years but does have some 
table of contents discretion as to the timing of such expenditure 
a major store refurbishment is evaluated using the same investment procedures and criteria as for a new store 
minor store redecorations are typically carried out every five years 
in addition to major store refurbishments  signet carries out minor store refurbishments where stores are profitable but do not satisfy the investment hurdle rate required for a full refurbishment  this is usually associated with a short term lease renewal 
where possible  the investment appraisal approach is also used to evaluate other investment opportunities 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million fiscal million  as a result of reduced capital investment in the existing businesses on both sides of the atlantic and a reduced rate of us new space growth 
the following table provides a summary of capital expenditure as a result of new space growth in the us  other additions in the us  and of capital additions in the uk and unallocated  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal million million million capital additions due to new us space other capital additions in us capital additions in us capital additions in uk and unallocated total purchases of property  plant  equipment and other intangible assets ratio of capital additions to depreciation and amortization in us ratio of capital additions to depreciation and amortization in uk ratio of capital additions to depreciation and amortization for signet in fiscal  in both the us and uk divisions  capital additions were less than depreciation and amortization 
this was a result of the use of more cautious sales forecasts in the investment appraisal process reflecting the challenging economic environment 
as a result fewer new stores were opened  fewer stores were refurbished and more stores were closed rather than refurbished at the end of leases 
investment in information technology was temporarily reduced 
free cash flow free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less net cash flow used in investing activities  non gaap measure  see item positive free cash flow in fiscal was million fiscal million  fiscal million  primarily as a result of a significant realignment of working capital to reflect lower sales in the existing business 
this was achieved even though net income adjusted for non cash items  non gaap measure  see item  declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in fiscal  a reduced level of cash being invested in working capital in the existing business and a lower level of investment in new us space than in fiscal led to an increase in free cash flow 
management believes that there is limited scope for a further reduction in working capital 
other factors for the increase in free cash flow in fiscal were a higher net income adjusted for non cash items  a reduction in investment in the existing business and reduced investment in new us store space 

table of contents to reflect the impact of investment in new us space on cash flow  the following summary provides an analysis of free cash flow before such investment and the working capital and capital expenditure required by new us space

known trends and uncertainties us division the current economic environment remains challenging and the prospects for same store sales remain uncertain 
for fiscal  the gross merchandise margin is expected to be at least at the level achieved in fiscal  with a decrease in diamond costs and selective price increases offsetting a rise in the cost of gold 
controllable expenses are expected to be broadly flat  with some benefit from store closures largely balancing inflation 
however  two factors will have an adverse impact 
first  the non recurring benefit recognized in fiscal of million arising from the change in vacation entitlement policy  and second  an anticipated net direct adverse impact on operating income in the range of million to million in fiscal resulting from amendments to the truth in lending act 
there may be a further indirect impact to sales arising from these amendments as a result of changes in consumer behavior 
expenses will also vary with sales to the extent they are above or below budgeted levels 
in the us  these variable expenses account for to of sales 
the net bad debt charge is uncertain and the primary driver of its performance is the economic environment 

table of contents a further slowing in the rate of new store openings will take place in fiscal  with the number of store closures is anticipated to be a little lower than in fiscal this will result in a small decline in store space see table below

uk division gross merchandise margin in fiscal is expected to be somewhat below that achieved in fiscal  primarily reflecting a higher cost of gold and a rise in value added tax partly offset by price increases 
action has been taken to improve staff scheduling and to reduce property costs  with the objective of slightly reducing pound sterling costs compared with those of fiscal as part of the long term strategy of focusing on major shopping centers  rather than traditional  less profitable high street locations  a further small reduction in net store space is expected in fiscal see table below

off balance sheet arrangements merchandise held by way of consignment signet held million of consignment inventory at january  january  million which is not recorded on the balance sheet 
the principal terms of the consignment agreements  which can generally be terminated by either side  are such that signet can return any  or all of  the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalty 
contingent property liabilities approximately uk property leases had been assigned by signet at january  and remained unexpired and occupied by assignees at that date and approximately additional properties were sub let at that date 
should the assignees or sub tenants fail to fulfill any obligations in respect of those leases or any other leases which have at any other time been assigned or sub let  signet or one of its uk subsidiaries may be liable for those defaults 
the number of such claims arising to date has been small  and the liability  which is charged to the income statement as it arises  has not been material 
contractual obligations a summary of operating lease obligations is set out below 
these primarily relate to minimum payments due under store lease arrangements 
the majority of the store operating leases provide for the payment of base rentals plus real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance fees and merchant association dues 
additional information regarding signet s operating leases is available in item  and note  included in item long term debt obligations comprise borrowings with an original maturity of greater than one year 
purchase obligations comprise contracts entered into for the forward purchase of gold and us dollars with an original maturity of greater than one year 
these contracts are taken out to manage market risks 
it is expected that operating commitments will be funded from future operating cash flows and no additional facilities will be required to meet these obligations 
contractual obligations as at january  less than one year between one and three years between three and five years more than five years total million million million million million long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations fixed interest and commitment fee payments creditors falling due after one year current income tax total 
table of contents as at january   signet had no long term floating rate indebtedness 
on march   signet made a prepayment of million in relation to the long term debt obligations 
following this prepayment  the revised contractual obligation between three and five years is million and more than five years is million and the total is million 
operating lease obligations relate to minimum payments due under store lease arrangements 
most store operating leases require payment of real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance fees 
real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance fees were approximately of base rentals for fiscal these are not included in the table above 
some operating leases also require additional payments based on a percentage of sales 
not included in the table above are obligations under employment agreements including pensions and ordinary course purchase orders for merchandise 
pensions signet has one defined benefit plan for uk based staff the group scheme  that was closed to new members in all other pension arrangements consist of defined contribution plans 
the net impact of foreign exchange movements on the assets and liabilities of the uk scheme in fiscal was million 
there was an actuarial loss on the group scheme liabilities of million fiscal million gain 
the fair value of the group scheme s assets excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements increased by million fiscal million decrease 
there was a retirement benefit deficit on the balance sheet of million january  million before a related deferred tax asset of million january  million 
the last triennial actuarial valuation was carried out as at april  and another will be carried out as at april  the valuation is updated at each fiscal year end 
the cash contribution to the group scheme in fiscal was million fiscal million 
signet has committed to contributing million each year for the next seven years in addition to the ongoing service contributions 
as a result  signet expects to contribute million into the pension scheme in fiscal if the deficit increases or decreases significantly  then this contribution might increase or decrease accordingly 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on signet s results for the past three years has not been significant apart from the impact of the increased cost of gold  and in the uk  the impact on merchandise costs due to the weakness of pound sterling against the us dollar 
impact of climate change signet recognizes that climate change is a major risk to society and therefore continues to take steps to reduce signet s climate impact 
management believes that climate change has a largely indirect influence on signet s performance and that it is of limited significance to the business 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies covering areas of greater complexity or those particularly subject to the exercise of judgment are listed below 
there are no material off balance sheet structures 
the principal accounting policies are set out in the financial statements in item foreign currency translation the results of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than us dollars are translated into us dollars at the weighted average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets are translated at the rates at the 
table of contents balance sheet date 
the average exchange rate is calculated using the weekly exchange rates weighted by the level of sales within the relevant period 
the income statement for fiscal used an average exchange rate of to pound sterling and there is no significant exposure to movements in exchange rates of other currencies 
a one cent increase in this rate would increase reported net income by million 
exchange differences arising from the translation of the net assets of these subsidiary undertakings are included in other comprehensive income 
other exchange differences arising from foreign currency transactions are included in operating income 
the results for fiscal include the impact from more significant movements between the us dollar and pound sterling than other years  which created larger exchange rate translation differences 
revenue recognition where a contractual obligation is borne by signet  revenue from the sale of extended service agreements is deferred and recognized  net of incremental costs arising from the initial sale  in proportion to anticipated claims arising 
this period is based on the historical claims experience of the business  which has been consistent since these products were launched 
management reviews the pattern of claims at the end of each year to determine any significant trends that may require changes to revenue recognition rates 
when promotional vouchers providing an incentive to enter into a future purchase are issued  the estimated fair value of these vouchers is treated as deferred revenue 
the fair value of these vouchers is calculated based on prior years experience 
the deferred revenue that represents income under extended warranty agreements and voucher promotions at the end of fiscal was million fiscal million 
provision is made for future returns expected within the stated return period  based on previous percentage return rates experienced 
depreciation and impairment depreciation is provided on freehold and long leasehold premises over a useful life not exceeding years 
freehold land is not depreciated 
depreciation is provided on other fixed assets at rates between and 
storefit depreciation rates have been set based on the refit cycle for each store fascia and the useful lives of each individual element of the storefit 
cash registers and other it equipment have separately determined depreciation rates 
in the uk  there are circumstances where refurbishments are carried out close to the end of the lease term  such that the expected life of the newly installed leasehold improvements will exceed the lease term 
where the renewal of the lease is reasonably assured  such storefronts  fixtures and fittings are depreciated over a period equal to the lesser of their economic useful life  or the remaining lease term plus the period of reasonably assured renewal 
reasonable assurance is gained through evaluation of the right to enter into a new lease  the performance of the store and potential availability of alternative sites 
where appropriate  impairments are made on assets that have a fair value less than net book value 
management has identified potentially impaired assets considering the cash flows of individual stores where trading since the initial opening of the store has reached a mature stage

table of contents expected on the group scheme s assets 
a full actuarial valuation was completed as at april  and the group scheme valuation is updated at each year end 
the discount rate assumption of applied for fiscal is based on the yield at the balance sheet date of long dated aa rated corporate bonds of equivalent currency and term to the group scheme s liabilities 
a increase in this discount rate would decrease the pension charge of million in fiscal by million 
the value of the assets of the group scheme is measured as at the balance sheet date  which is particularly dependent on the value of equity investments held at that date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk signet is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices and interest rates 
signet monitors and manages these market exposures as a fundamental part of its overall risk management program  which recognizes the volatility of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects of this volatility on signet s operating results 
market risk management policy a committee of the board is responsible for the implementation of market risk management policies within the treasury policies and guidelines framework  which are deemed to be appropriate by the board for the management of market risk 
signet s exposure to market risk is managed by the signet s treasury department 
where deemed necessary to achieve the objective of reducing market risk volatility on signet s operating results  certain derivative instruments are entered into by specialist treasury personnel 
signet uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes only 
a description of signet s accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of item signet s current portfolio of derivative financial instruments consists of forward foreign currency exchange contracts  foreign currency option contracts  foreign currency swaps  forward contracts for the purchase of gold and option contracts for the purchase of gold 
an analysis quantifying the fair value change in derivative financial instruments held by signet to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates is detailed on page foreign currency exchange rate risk signet redenominated its share capital and changed its functional currency to us dollars with effect from february  and since this date has published its consolidated annual financial statements in us dollars 
some of total assets were held in us dollars at january  and approximately of its sales and of its operating income were generated in us dollars for fiscal nearly all the remainder of signet s assets  sales and operating income are in pounds sterling 
in translating the results of its uk operations  signet s results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the us dollar 
any depreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the pound sterling could increase reported revenues and operating profit and any appreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the pound sterling could decrease reported revenues and operating profit 
the board has chosen not to hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on signet s operating results 

table of contents the uk division buys on international markets certain products and materials that are priced in us dollars  and therefore has an exposure to exchange rates on the cost of goods sold 
signet uses certain derivative financial instruments to hedge this exposure  within treasury guidelines approved by the board 
signet holds a fluctuating amount of pounds sterling cash reflecting the cash generative characteristics of the uk division 
signet s objective is to minimize net foreign exchange exposure to the income statement on sterling denominated items through managing this level of cash  sterling denominated intercompany balances and us dollar to sterling swaps 
in order to manage the foreign exchange exposure and minimize the level of pounds sterling cash held by the company  the sterling denominated subsidiaries pay dividends regularly to their immediate holding companies 
commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities 
signet s results are subject to fluctuations in the underlying cost price of diamonds and certain precious metals which are key raw material components of the products sold by signet 
it is signet s policy to minimize the impact of precious metal commodity price volatility on operating results through the use of outright forward purchases of  or by entering into options to purchase  precious metals within treasury guidelines approved by the board 
in particular  signet undertakes some hedging of its requirement for gold through the use of options  forward contracts and commodity purchasing  while fluctuations in the cost of diamonds are not hedged 
interest rate risk signet s interest income or charge is exposed to volatility in interest rates 
this exposure is driven by both the currency denomination of the debt us dollars or pounds sterling  the mix of fixed and floating rate debt used and the total amount of cash and debt outstanding 
sensitivity analysis management has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the change in the fair value of signet s financial instruments from hypothetical changes in market rates as shown in the table below 
fair value changes arising from fair value january  rise in interest rates depreciation of against depreciation of precious metal prices fair value january  million million million million million foreign exchange contracts commodity contracts floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings floating rate bank deposits the amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis quantify the impact of market risk assuming that certain adverse market conditions  specified in the table above  occur 
they are not forward looking estimates of market risk 
actual results in the future are likely to differ materially from those projected due to changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and actual developments in the global financial markets 
any changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and developments in the global financial markets may cause fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates and precious metal prices to exceed the hypothetical amounts 
table of contents disclosed in the table above 
the sensitivity scenarios are intended to allow an expected risk measure to be applied to the scenarios  as opposed to the scenarios themselves being an indicator of the maximum expected risk 
the example shown for changes in the fair values of borrowings and associated derivative financial instruments at january  is set out in the table above 
the fair values of borrowings and derivative financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the period end 
the estimated changes in fair values for interest rate movements are based on an increase of basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at january  with all other variables remaining constant 
the estimated changes in the fair value for foreign exchange rates are based on a depreciation of the pound sterling against us dollar from the levels applicable at january  with all other variables remaining constant
