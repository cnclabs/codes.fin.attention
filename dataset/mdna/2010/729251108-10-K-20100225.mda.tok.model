overview operating performance compared to the economic conditions in were the most difficult the company has ever faced 
the recession that began in continued into causing severe unemployment  sharp declines in home values and an excess supply of new and existing homes on the market 
all of these factors resulted in significant downward price pressure on the products we sell 
overall  our operating income decreased by million  or  compared to our prior year s operating income of million 
operating income in our northern resources segment decreased by million from operating income of million in to an operating loss of million in operating income in our southern resources segment decreased by million from million in to million in the declines in operating income were due primarily to weak sawlog prices and lower harvest levels 
harvest levels decreased as a result of the partial deferral of sawlog harvests due to weak log prices and the contribution of approximately  acres of our southern timberlands to a timberland venture 
our manufacturing business incurred an operating loss of million in compared to an operating loss of million in as a result of the weak outlook for manufactured wood products  we significantly downsized our manufacturing operations in we permanently closed two lumber mills  indefinitely suspended production at one additional lumber mill and one remanufacturing facility and reduced production at another lumber mill 
additionally  as a result of weak prices  we significantly reduced production at both our plywood and mdf facilities 
in connection with the downsizing of our lumber business we recorded an impairment charge of million  pension settlement expense of million and severance expense of million 
operating income in our real estate segment increased by million to million 
the increase was due primarily to the closing of the second phase of our three phase conservation sale that was negotiated in and the sale of approximately  acres of large non strategic properties 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item additionally  our net income for reflects an income tax benefit of million 
the income tax benefit includes a tax benefit of million associated with a change in tax law and a benefit of million related to operating losses from our manufacturing operations 
liquidity the company believes it has a strong balance sheet and does not foresee any liquidity issues 
at december   we had cash of million and million available for borrowing on our line of credit 
during  we generated cash provided by operations of million 
we expect cash provided by operations in to decrease by approximately million due to lower proceeds from real estate sales and no proceeds from funds held in a like kind exchange escrow account ie a working capital benefit 
despite expecting to generate less cash from operations in  we believe the cash we generate will be sufficient to make principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  fund planned capital expenditures and make our quarterly dividend distributions during key economic factors impacting our resources and manufactured products business our operating performance for the resources and manufactured products segments is impacted primarily by the supply and demand for logs and wood products in the united states 
the short term supply of logs is impacted primarily by weather and the level of harvesting activities 
the demand for logs and wood products in the united states is impacted by housing starts  repair and remodeling activities  industrial activity and the amount of imported lumber  primarily from canada 
selected us housing economic data was as follows at december us housing starts in millions supply of existing homes for sale in months year fixed interest mortgage rates average housing starts of  for were at a record low level and were over below their peak earlier in the decade 
housing starts for are expected to improve modestly 
housing starts are not expected to significantly improve until the unemployment rate decreases and there is a reduction in the supply of homes for sale 
as a result of the recession in the us  the unemployment rate is approximately and is expected to remain high during there is currently a seven months supply of new and existing homes for sale which is well above the historical average four month supply 
the supply of homes for sale could increase in the future due to a potential increase in foreclosures and the end to the government stimulus programs 
for example  for the past year  home sales have been supported by a tax credit for first time buyers 
in addition to weak housing starts  the demand for wood products in the repair and remodeling sector also weakened during repair and remodeling activities were down approximately from their peak earlier in the decade 
the decline was driven by falling home prices  low consumer confidence and increased job losses 
home values have decreased by approximately from their peak earlier in the decade 
the lower housing starts and reduced repair and remodeling activities have reduced lumber demand and therefore log demand 
this has resulted in downward price pressure for the logs and wood products we sell 
we expect the prices for our logs and wood products to remain weak until there is a significant improvement in the us economy and a decline in the unemployment rate 
over the past several years  fuel prices have fluctuated significantly 
our timber and manufacturing operations are significantly impacted by changing fuel prices 
during  operating income in our timber business was million higher compared to the prior year due to lower fuel prices 
however in  our operating income was negatively affected by million compared to due mostly to rising fuel costs 
real estate sales and development properties we estimate that included in the company s approximately million acres of timberlands at december   are about million acres of higher value timberlands which are expected to be sold and or developed over the next years for recreational  conservation or residential purposes 
included within the million acres of higher value timberlands are approximately million acres we expect to sell for recreational uses  approximately  acres we expect to sell for conservation and approximately  acres that are identified as having development potential 
in plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item addition  the company has approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the next five years 
some of our real estate activities  including our real estate development business  are conducted through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
during  we sold approximately  acres of small non strategic timberlands  approximately  acres for conservation purposes and approximately  acres of higher and better use recreational properties 
additionally  during  we sold approximately  acres of large non strategic properties 
from time to time  we may dispose of large blocks of timberlands to maximize value 
during we may adjust the type and geographic location of properties sold to respond to areas with active markets 
our sales plan for includes several large sales that have closed in the first quarter of consisting of  acres of conservation properties and  acres of non strategic properties 
additionally  sales for will include approximately  acres from the expected closing of the third phase of our montana conservation sale 
during  we sold approximately  acres of conservation properties for million compared to selling approximately  acres for million in the primary reason for the increase in revenue from the sale of conservation properties was due to the sale of  acres in montana for million which closes in three phases 
the first phase covering approximately  acres for proceeds of million closed in the second phase covering approximately  acres for proceeds of million closed in the third phase covering approximately  acres for proceeds of million is expected to close during the fourth quarter of we expect lower proceeds from conservation sales in compared to our average sales realization for higher and better use recreational properties declined approximately in compared to the prior year due primarily to selling more lower value recreational properties 
the demand for rural real estate started to weaken in and remained weak throughout as a result of the credit crisis and recession in the us consequently  we have increased our listing of lower value properties and have deferred listing our higher value properties until the demand for rural real estate improves 
in  we expect to increase the number of acres of higher and better use recreational properties we sell due primarily to our focus on listing more lower valued properties 
however  we expect the demand for our higher valued properties to remain weak 
our land development business slowed dramatically in as the economy weakened causing a significant decrease in the demand for these properties 
revenue from sales of development properties was million during we expect sales in to approximate the level and do not expect significant sales of development properties to occur until there is an improvement in consumer confidence and the us economy 
harvest levels the volume of trees we harvest each year and the percentage of sawlogs and pulpwood product mix included in our annual harvest also impact our operating performance 
during  we harvested a total of million tons compared to a total of million tons during the decline in harvest levels in was due primarily to contributing  acres to a timberland venture in and the deferral of our sawlog harvest as a result of weak log prices and limited demand due to mill closures and curtailments 
we expect harvest levels during to range between and million tons  and we expect to continue to defer a significant portion of our northern resources segment sawlog harvest until prices improve 
future harvest levels may vary from historic levels due to weaker than expected markets  to take advantage of favorable prices or due to factors outside of our control  such as weather and fires 
future harvest levels may also be impacted by our sale of timberlands and the extent to which proceeds are reinvested in core timberlands 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition for timber sales timber sales revenues are recognized when legal ownership and the risk of loss transfer to the purchaser and the quantity sold is determinable 
we sell timber under delivered log agreements and through sales of standing timber or stumpage using pay as cut sales contracts or timber deed sale agreements 
delivered log sales 
under a delivered log sale agreement  we harvest the timber and deliver it to the buyer 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered as risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer 
with delivered log sales  we incur the cost of logging and hauling 
pay as cut sales contracts 
pay as cut sales contracts are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each type of tree over the term of the contract usually to months 
in some cases  an advance is received in connection with pay as cut sales contracts 
in other cases  the buyer agrees to harvest only certain trees on a tract of land 
under pay as cut sales contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue is recognized when the timber is harvested  as title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer 
total revenue recognized under a pay as cut sales contract is the total volume of wood removed multiplied by the unit price for each type of tree 
timber deeds 
timber deed sales are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually to months 
unlike a pay as cut sales contract  risk of loss and title to the trees transfer to the buyer when the contract is signed 
the buyer also pays the full purchase price when the contract is signed 
under a timber deed  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue from a timber deed sale is recognized when the contract is signed 
timber deeds are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise which is an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc total revenue recognized under a timber deed is not dependent upon the volume or types of trees actually harvested 
the following table summarizes amounts recognized under each method from sales to external customers in the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december in millions revenues from delivered log sales pay as cut sales timber deed sales substantially all of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  approximately of our timber sales in and in consisted of pay as cut sales contracts or timber deed sales 
since under sales of stumpage the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs  the operating profit as a percentage of revenue is typically higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales as of december   we estimate that included in the company s approximately million acres of timberlands are about million acres of higher value timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the next fifteen years for recreational  conservation  or residential purposes 
included within the million acres of higher value timberlands are approximately million acres we expect to sell for recreational uses  approximately  acres we expect to sell for conservation and approximately  acres that are identified as having development potential 
in addition  the company has approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the next five years 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the ability to obtain entitlements  the number of properties listed for sale  the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation  the timing of harvesting activities  and the availability of government and not for profit funding 
as a result  the timing of our real estate sales may materially impact our reported operating income and net income 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item during  the real estate segment reported an operating profit percentage of approximately 
we estimate our real estate segment s annual operating profit percentage could range from to of revenues 
the operating profit percentage depends on the nature of the interest sold and how much the market value of the property has risen over its book value 
for example  the sale of conservation easements will generally have an operating profit percentage of close to because historically no book basis was allocated to these types of sales 
sales of recently acquired properties will generally have relatively lower operating profit percentages while sales of properties held for a long time will tend to have relatively higher operating profit percentages 
sales of timberlands owned by plum creek prior to the timber company merger  which  for accounting purposes  were deemed acquired as of the merger date  will thus have lower operating profit percentages since these properties were recorded at appraised value as of october in general  timberlands are acquired primarily for long term use in our timber operations 
in connection with timberland acquisitions  we are generally not able to identify  with any level of precision  our future real estate sales ie specific properties with a higher value than for use in timber production 
however  our purchase price allocation and related appraisals for these acquisitions may reflect greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future but are not yet specifically identified 
therefore  in connection with our purchase price allocation for timberland acquisitions  the greater values for real estate are allocated proportionately among all of the acres acquired 
specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
we believe that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our ability to recover the net investment in long lived assets when required by the accounting standards 
we recognize an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets used in our business when the carrying value net book value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets over their expected useful life 
impairment losses are measured by the extent to which the carrying value of a group of assets exceeds the fair value of such assets at a given point in time 
generally  our fair value measurements used in calculating an impairment loss are categorized as level measurements ie unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity under the fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards codification 
typically  we will use a discounted cash flow model or an external appraisal to estimate the fair value of the affected assets 
furthermore  we recognize an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of the assets exceeds an amount equal to their fair value less selling costs 
since  we have grown substantially through acquisitions 
the purchase prices of these acquisitions have been allocated to our timber and timberlands including assets held for sale and real estate development properties and property  plant and equipment 
the allocation of the purchase price is highly subjective 
management is required to estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the original allocation  these assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations 
our long lived assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are independent cash flows 
we track cash flows for our million acres of timberlands by grouping them into seven geographic areas in the northern resources segment and six geographic areas in the southern resources segment 
additionally  we track cash flows for each of our eight manufacturing facilities 
timber and timberlands used in our business 
for assets used in our business  an impairment loss is recorded only when the carrying value of those assets is not recoverable through future operations 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the assets 
we use one harvest cycle which ranges between and years for evaluating the recoverability of our timber and timberlands 
because of the inherently long life of timber and timberlands  we do not expect to incur an impairment loss in the future for the timber and timberlands used in our timber business 
timber and timberlands held for sale 
an impairment loss is recognized for long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of those assets exceeds an amount equal to its fair value less selling costs 
an asset is generally considered to be held for sale when we have committed to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer eg  listed with a broker  and the sale is expected to close within one year 
during  the above criteria were met by a number of our timberland properties  and we recognized impairment losses of million for certain of these properties 
similarly  we recognized impairment losses of plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item million in and in connection with timberlands held for sale see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue to sell or exchange non strategic timberlands to other forest products companies or non industrial buyers  and it is probable that we will recognize additional impairment losses in the future in connection with sales of non strategic timberlands 
an impairment loss is generally not recorded until management has concluded that it is probable ie  likely that timberlands will be sold within the next months 
for many properties that are currently listed for sale  it is difficult to conclude whether they will be sold within one year and to estimate the price 
nevertheless  management performs a probability assessment for all properties that are listed for sale and records an impairment loss to the extent the property s book basis exceeds its estimated fair value net of selling cost in the quarter in which management has concluded it is likely the property will be sold within twelve months 
property  plant and equipment 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment represents primarily the net book value of our eight two of which are indefinitely curtailed manufacturing facilities 
each manufacturing facility is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through future operations 
the estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a manufacturing facility is highly subjective and is dependent upon estimates for future product pricing  raw material costs and availability  volumes of product sold  and residual value of the facility 
during the first quarter of  the company conducted an analysis to rationalize and consolidate its lumber operations due to the significant and sustained decline in lumber demand along with the company s expectations for continued weakness in this business 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that certain of its lumber manufacturing assets were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million related to these assets 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of million in connection with our lumber manufacturing assets as a result of the significant decline in housing starts and the expectation for continued weak lumber prices 
we currently estimate that the carrying value for our eight facilities is recoverable through future operations and that our estimate of future cash flows is reasonable 
however  if wood product prices were to remain weak at current levels for an extended period of time  or if log or raw material availability declines  the company may be required to record an impairment loss for one or more of its manufacturing facilities in a future period 
capitalized real estate development costs 
current and future costs associated with specific real estate development projects are capitalized once management has concluded it is probable that a project will be successful 
real estate development costs are expensed as incurred when management is not able to conclude that it is probable a project will be successful 
furthermore  previously capitalized costs for specific projects are written off when management revises its prior assessment and concludes that it is probable a project will not be successful and costs will not be recovered 
for many of our projects  there is less judgment in making this determination due to prior experience in the local market or advice from consultants 
however  for some of our larger projects where we have limited experience in the local market or for projects in environmentally sensitive areas  there is significant judgment in assessing the expected outcome for the projects 
at december   we have million of capitalized costs associated with projects that management expects will be successful 
of these capitalized costs  approximately million represent costs for a single project that has been approved by a state commission but is being appealed in court by groups opposed to the project 
while not expected  if the approval is reversed  some or all of these capitalized costs could be written off in the next twelve months 
depletion depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested 
depletion rates for each region are adjusted at least annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south to as long as years in the north 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item the following table summarizes depletion expense recognized in the company s financial statements  key assumptions and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december dollars in millions  except per ton amounts depletion expense northern resources segment southern resources segment total depletion expense average depletion rates per ton northern resources segment southern resources segment assumptions used to determine the average depletion rates estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation northern resources segment southern resources segment a estimated future volume in million tons northern resources segment b southern resources segment c sensitivity of results to changes in key assumptions increase in depletion expense for a increase in estimated future silviculture costs d northern resources segment southern resources segment decrease in estimated future volume e northern resources segment southern resources segment a reflects a decrease in our estimates of future costs associated with fertilization treatments due to lower chemical and application costs along with assumption of fewer acres treated 
b decrease from is due primarily to divestitures in montana and wisconsin 
c decrease from is due primarily to the contribution of  acres of timberland to a timberland venture 
d assumes future timber volumes do not change 
e assumes future silviculture costs do not change 
significant estimates and judgments are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers and chemicals  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
we have invested in technology that enables us to predict our current standing inventory of trees  future growth rates  and the benefits of scientific advancements in connection with seedlings  planting techniques and fertilizer applications 
therefore  while estimates with respect to depletion computations will be revised at least annually  we do not expect the depletion rates will change materially from year to year 
accounting for share based compensation plum creek has a stockholder approved stock incentive plan that provides for the award of non qualified stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  value management awards and dividend equivalents 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
grants of value management awards represent awards that are classified and accounted for as liabilities 
as a result  the expense recognized over the performance period will equal the fair value ie  cash value of an award as of the last day of plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item the performance period multiplied by the number of awards that are earned 
furthermore  the quarterly expense recognized during the performance period is based on the fair value as of the end of the most recent quarter 
prior to the end of the performance period  compensation costs for value management awards is based on the awards most recent quarterly fair values and the number of months of service rendered during the performance period 
fair values for value management awards are computed based on our historical relative total shareholder return and simulated relative total shareholder return compared to the performance of peer groups consisting of forest products companies  the s p index and the morgan stanley reit index over the same period peer group 
the simulated total shareholder return of the company and the peer group is computed using a monte carlo simulation 
the key assumptions used in the simulation of the company s and the peer group s total shareholder return are volatility  beta the measure of how plum creek s stock moves relative to the market as a whole  risk free interest rate  and expected dividend yield 
the fair value of the liability for outstanding value management awards at december  was million  which is based on the current fair value of outstanding awards multiplied by the percentage of months that services were provided during the performance period 
the liability at december  could range between million and million based on the possible fair value of all outstanding liability based awards 
we could have a material adjustment to our share based compensation liability to the extent there is a material change in the fair value of our value management awards during the quarter 
pensions plum creek provides pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan and two supplemental non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
participants benefits vest after three years of service 
the cash balance benefits for salaried employees is determined based primarily on certain percentages of compensation  age  years of service and interest accrued based on the year treasury bond rate 
participants who were employees of the company on september   earn benefits based on the greater of the cash balance formula or a monthly pension benefit that is principally based on the highest monthly average earnings during any consecutive sixty month out of the last month period and the number of years of service credit 
the benefits to hourly employees are generally based on a fixed amount per year of service 
plum creek s contributions to its qualified pension plan vary from year to year  but the company has made at least the minimum contributions required by law in each year 
it is generally the company s policy to fund the qualified pension plan annually such that the fair value of plan assets equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation the approximate actuarially computed current pension obligation if the plan was discontinued over a market cycle generally to years 
the company has the same funding policy for the non qualified plan 
however  assets related to the non qualified plans are held in a grantor trust and are subject to the claims of creditors and  therefore  are not considered plan assets 
the computation of the company s benefit obligation  pension cost and accrued pension liability under us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain assumptions involving primarily the following weighted average rates assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at december discount rates a annuity distributions lump sum distributions rate of compensation increase b assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected long term return on plan assets c rate of compensation increase b a the december  discount rate for annuity distributions was determined by the resulting yield of a hypothetical bond portfolio at december   matched to the expected benefit payments under the plans 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item bonds selected for this portfolio had a moody s or standard poor s credit rating of aa or better as of december  the december  discount rate for lump sum distributions is based on yields on year us treasury bonds 
b the assumed rate of increase of future compensation levels represents our long term estimate of such increases on the basis of the composition of plan participants  past results and market expectations 
c the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the portfolio 
since pension benefits may be settled in either a single lump sum or an annuity distribution  both the estimated percentage of participants electing a lump sum payment and the assumed interest rate discount rate used in computing the lump sum benefit are key assumptions 
management currently estimates that approximately half of the qualified plan participants will elect a lump sum distribution upon termination 
other key assumptions used in the estimate include primarily those underlying the mortality table  and expected long term rates for inflation  retirement and withdrawals  all of which are based on plan experience and standard actuarial methods but which are nevertheless subject to uncertainty 
it is likely that the actual return on plan assets and the outcome of other uncertain variables will differ from those used in estimating our pension costs and pension obligation 
furthermore  the company may  from time to time  adjust the asset allocation  which may have an impact on the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the following table summarizes key financial measures and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december in millions key financial measures pension expense a cash pension plan contributions qualified plan cash grantor trust funding supplemental plans current accrued pension liability non current accrued pension liability sensitivity to changes in key assumptions increase in pension expense for every percentage point decrease in long term rate of return on plan assets decrease in weighted average discount rate increase in rate of increase in compensation levels increase in qualified pension funding actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation for every percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate every percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate assumption for lump sum benefits a pension expense for includes a million settlement loss recorded as a result of lump sum distributions for the year ended december  the settlement loss represents a partial recognition of the actuarial pension loss reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
assuming an average long term rate of return on plan assets of  and weighted average discount rates of for annuity distributions and for lump sum distributions for and beyond  and a rate of increase in compensation levels  we project our annual pension expense for will be approximately million and will range between million and million each year for through over the same time periods  the annual cash funding required under our present funding policy and current funding rules for the qualified pension plan is expected to range between and million in  and be approximately million each year for through we expect to fund between and million in to our supplemental non qualified pension plans and approximately million each year for through plum creek form k

at the forest level  ranging in size from  to over million acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  certain external conditions such as supply agreements  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
harvest scheduling is the technical approach using computer modeling that considers all of the above factors along with forest growth rates and financial assumptions to project future harvest plans for a number of years forward 
our actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of timberland sales and acquisitions  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs 
furthermore  future harvest levels will be impacted by sales of timberlands 
the impact will depend on the level and extent we are able to reinvest proceeds in productive timberlands and the stocking levels and age class distribution of any newly acquired timberlands 
harvest levels in the northern resources segment were approximately million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and about million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during we expect harvest levels for sawlogs in to be comparable to due primarily to continued weak log prices and limited demand 
we expect harvest levels for pulpwood to decrease by approximately due primarily to temporarily increasing harvest levels in and to capture favorable pulpwood prices  recent timberland sales and weaker demand 
harvest levels in the southern resources segment were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during total harvest levels for are expected to be similar to  however  pulpwood volumes are expected to decline by approximately one million tons and sawlog volumes are expected to increase by one million tons resulting in a mix of approximately sawlogs and pulpwood 
during the past several years  we have concentrated on thinning young stands ie  first thinnings to maintain vigorous growth rates and to capture favorable pulpwood prices 
the timber harvested during these first thinnings is predominately pulpwood 
as a result of accelerating pulpwood harvests in prior years  our standing inventory has shifted and  therefore  in we will be focusing a greater proportion of thinnings on more mature timber stands that contain both pulpwood and small diameter sawlogs 
conservation sale in northern resources segment during  we signed an agreement to sell approximately  acres of timberlands in montana in our northern resources segment for million in three phases 
proceeds from the first phase were million and were received in proceeds from the second phase were million and were received in proceeds from the third phase of million are expected to be received in manufactured products segment production levels as a result of the continuing decline in demand for wood products during  we permanently closed two lumber mills  indefinitely suspended production at one additional lumber mill and one remanufacturing facility and reduced production at another lumber mill 
we have also reduced production at our mdf and plywood facilities in response to the decline in demand 
for  we expect to continue to operate all of our manufactured products facilities at reduced levels similar to until markets for wood products improve  our expected production levels and sales volumes will be significantly lower than both the combined capacity of our facilities and historical operating rates 
us canada softwood lumber agreement historically  canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market  particularly in the new home construction market 
in  the softwood lumber agreement sla was signed by the us and canada establishing a system of tiered taxes and or volume restrictions that will be in effect for a period of seven years 
generally  the sla provides that no import restrictions would be imposed on canadian lumber shipments to the us when the published composite price for lumber is higher than per thousand board feet 
below that level  a system of tiered export tax and or volume restrictions would be triggered 
the impact of the taxes could be mitigated by fluctuations in the rate of exchange between us and canadian dollars 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item notwithstanding the signing of the sla between the us and canadian governments  there can be no assurance it will effectively create a fair trade environment 
therefore  when demand for wood products in the us improves  downward pressure on domestic timber and lumber prices caused by canadian imports could increase

our average sales price per acre for higher and better use recreational lands decreased approximately during due primarily to selling more of our lower valued recreational properties 
in the latter part of  we began selling more lower valued recreational properties as demand and price for properties with a higher value per acre significantly weakened 
the weaker demand for higher valued recreational properties was due primarily to the decline in consumer discretionary capital  declining consumer confidence and the inability of buyers to secure debt financing

external sales of wood chips and residuals were lower due primarily to production curtailments at regional mills 
mdf sales volume decreased by in compared to mdf demand has weakened considerably and is expected to remain weak until the housing market recovers 
the weaker demand was due primarily to the significant decline in housing starts and related construction activity along with increased competition from foreign mdf manufacturers and new domestic production 
while global mdf capacity increased an estimated during  total north american mdf consumption decreased approximately during the same year

our resources and manufactured products segments have significant uses of cash  and as a result our operating income excluding depletion and depreciation approximates the segment s operating cash flow 
on the other hand  our cash outflows in our real estate and other segments are very small  and as a result our revenues from those segments approximate operating cash flows 
occasionally  we may recognize revenues in connection with non cash exchanges of timberland when the exchanges are considered to have commercial substance 
during  we recognized million of revenue in the real estate segment in connection with a non cash exchange of timberland 
in certain circumstances for our other segment  cash will be received in upfront payments  such as lease bonuses  but revenues will be recognized over several reporting periods quarters or years 
we have summarized our sources and uses of cash in a table at the end of this section 
during  our cash flows continued to be negatively impacted by the significant downturn in the us economy and specifically by the decline in housing starts 
the weak housing market caused the operating income of our timber business to decline by approximately  and we continued to generate an operating loss in our manufacturing business 
however  despite the weak economy  due to our extensive and unique land holdings  we continued to generate significant proceeds from real estate sales 
for example  we received proceeds of million during from the closing of the second phase of a three phase transaction

we believe the housing market hit bottom in and will slowly begin to improve in we expect cash provided by operating activities to decline by approximately million from the million we generated in however  we believe this lower level will be more than adequate to fund our current dividend approximately million  planned capital expenditures million to million and scheduled long term debt principal payments million 
the lower expected cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to reduced proceeds from real estate sales and no distributions of funds held in a like kind exchange escrow account a working capital benefit  as no funds are held at the end of the following table summarizes total cash flows for operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities change in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities

see results of operations for a discussion of factors impacting segment operating income 
the favorable working capital change is due primarily to the timing of when proceeds from a like kind exchange escrow account are either reinvested in replacement property or distributed to the company 
proceeds associated with a forward like kind exchange are either reinvested in like kind property within days or distributed to the company at the end of either the day identification period or the day reinvestment period

a portion of the loan proceeds were used to retire outstanding indebtedness to unrelated parties 
during  we made interest payments of million to the venture compared to interest payments of million in during  we received million in cash distributions from the venture while no distributions were received in as a result of lower debt levels to unrelated parties and lower interest rates on our variable rate debt  we reduced interest payments for debt obligations to unrelated parties by million in additionally  during we made pension contributions of million while only million was required in based on our funding policy 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million in this decrease of million is due primarily to a combined million decrease in operating income for our resources segments and our manufactured products segment net of a non cash impairment charge and a million negative working capital change  offset in part by higher real estate segment sales of million and proceeds from gas exploration rights of million

debt covenants 
our senior notes  term credit agreements and line of credit contain various restrictive covenants  none of which are expected to materially impact the financing of our ongoing operations 
we are in compliance with all of our borrowing agreement covenants as of december  these restrictive covenants include limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness  making restricted payments such as payments of cash dividends or stock repurchases  harvest levels and sales of assets 
furthermore  our line of credit and term credit agreements require that we maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios 
we have no covenants and restrictions associated with changes in our debt ratings 
we have investment grade long term debt ratings from both of the primary rating services 
our debt is rated bbb stable outlook by standard poor s and baa stable outlook by moody s investors service 
furthermore  there are no material covenants associated with our note payable to timberland venture  and the indebtedness is not considered in computing any of our debt covenants since the debt is an obligation of plum creek timber company  inc and not the partnership 
as of december   we can borrow the entire million under our line of credit 
we expect to be able to incur at least this level of additional indebtedness for the next twelve months 
the borrowing agreements limit our ability to make restricted payments based on a computation of available cash  which is generally our net income excluding gains on the sale of capital assets after adjusting for non cash charges such as depreciation and depletion  changes in various reserves  less capital expenditures and principal payments on indebtedness that are not financed 
additionally  the amount of available cash may be increased by the amount of proceeds from the sale of higher and better use properties and  under certain circumstances  by of the amount of net proceeds from the sale of other assets

on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share  or approximately million  which will be paid on march   to stockholders of record on february  future dividends will be determined by our board of directors  in its sole discretion  based on consideration of a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on the company s ability to make cash payments  borrowing capacity  changes in the prices of and demand for plum creek s products  and changes in our ability to sell timberlands at attractive prices 
other factors that our board of directors considers include the appropriate timing of timber harvests  acquisition and divestiture opportunities  stock repurchases  debt repayment and other means by which the company could deliver value to its stockholders 
plum creek s board of directors has authorized a common stock repurchase program that may be increased from time to time at the board of directors discretion

future cash requirements 
cash required to meet our financial needs will be significant 
in  we have million of scheduled long term debt principal payments of which substantially all was paid during the first quarter of using a combination of cash and available borrowing capacity under our million line of credit 
additionally  we believe that our current cash on hand and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures and interest payments on our indebtedness through the end of other information consolidation of variable interest entities 
in june  the fasb issued a revised accounting standard regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities 
among other things  the revised standard amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie  requires a qualitative rather than quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie  requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
the revised standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   for interim periods within those fiscal years  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
the company does not expect the adoption of this revised accounting standard will have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

the fair value of the company s note payable to timberland venture is estimated using the same rates as the public debt adjusted by an estimated risk premium for holding company debt and the different maturity 
the decrease in fair value of our fixed rate debt compared to december  excluding related party debt was due primarily to the principal repayments of million of senior notes in  offset in part by declining market interest rates 
in december  treasury rates were slightly higher than in december  but credit spreads the difference between corporate debt rates and treasury rates had declined significantly from resulting in lower market interest rates 
this change in rates also resulted in the increase in fair value of our note payable to timberland venture at december  compared to december  the fair value of our floating rate term loans variable rate debt as of december  and december  was determined by adjusting the spread over libor to a current market spread for comparable debt as of december  and december  b excludes unamortized discount of million and million at december  and  respectively
