item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview stein mart is a national retailer offering the fashion merchandise  service and presentation of a better department or specialty store at prices competitive with off price retail chains 
our focused assortment of merchandise features current season moderate to better fashion apparel for women and men  as well as accessories  gifts  linens and shoes 
we believe we differentiate ourselves from typical off price retail chains by offering i primarily current season merchandise carried by better department or specialty stores  ii moderate to better price levels  iii a stronger merchandising statement  consistently offering more depth of color and size in individual stock keeping units  and iv merchandise presentation and customer service more comparable to department stores and upscale retailers 
highlights we are proud to have reversed two years of losses and earned a significant profit in one of the most demanding years in our history 
rigorous focus on inventory levels and freshness  dedication to expense reduction and emphasis on cash generation all contributed to our profitability this year 
we returned to a profit in all four quarters  improved gross margin by nearly basis points over  reduced selling  general and administrative sg a expenses by million excluding store closing and impairment charges  and increased cash generated from operations five fold 
the transformation of our supply chain methodology from direct to store shipments to centralized distribution increased our gross profit by million and decreased sg a primarily store payroll by million for a total improvement on our pre tax results of million 
for the year ended january   we earned million or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share in the results include million pre tax of store closing and asset impairment charges  or per diluted share 
full year results include charges totaling per share  consisting of million pre tax for store closing and asset impairment charges and a fourth quarter valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million 
excluding these charges  earnings per diluted share is in compared to a net loss per diluted share of in on the balance sheet  we ended with million in cash and no borrowings compared to net debt borrowings in excess of cash of million at the end of during the fourth quarter of  we exercised the option to extend our credit facility for one year through january inventories at the end of were million compared with million at the end of inventories at the end of included approximately million of merchandise in third party distribution centers that was received earlier than at the end of as part of the new supply chain network 
these planned earlier receipts also increased accounts payable at the end of excluding the merchandise in our distribution centers  our average store inventory decreased percent at the end of to  from  at the end of outlook we are planning conservatively 
our first priority is improving sales  while continuing to focus on expense and operational controls 
with the full deployment of our new supply chain process and a significant information systems enhancement  we believe we are correctly positioned to further improve our business and attract customers 
we expect the following factors to influence our business in we will continue to manage our inventories in line with our sales and expect them to increase only due to the impact of merchandise located in the distribution centers due to supply chain 

table of contents we expect sg a savings from supply chain will be similar to savings and should slightly more than offset the addbacks of compensation and related expenses that were temporarily lowered in we plan to relocate five to ten stores to better locations in their respective markets 
we also plan to close four and open three stores for a net planned decrease of one store by year end 
new stores will have negligible incremental profit benefit in as their partial year results will be largely offset by pre opening costs that are expensed when the stores are opened 
our effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate due to the impact of book tax differences on our deferred tax valuation allowance 
capital expenditures are planned at approximately million compared to million in approximately million is for system improvements  with the largest portion for a new merchandise information system 
the remaining capital amounts are to upgrade our store fixtures in connection with our new and relocated stores 
stores there were stores open as of january   stores as of january  and stores as of february  stores at beginning of year stores opened during the year stores closed during the year stores at end of year while we are always interested in looking at exceptional real estate opportunities  our focus for will primarily be on relocating existing stores to better real estate 
we are reviewing current situations where leases will be ending or have provisions for early termination and hope to take advantage of this real estate market and lock in better locations in some markets where there is additional opportunity 
results of operations the following table sets forth each line item of the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales numbers may not add due to rounding net sales cost of merchandise sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other income  net income loss from operations interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss store closings during  and  we closed under performing stores 
the table below sets forth the impact on operations in each of the presented years for stores closed in that and subsequent years in thousands 
the table presents the losses from the stores that closed during the table presents the sum of the losses from the stores that closed during and the stores that closed during  the table presents the sum of the losses from the stores that closed during  the stores that closed during and the two stores that closed during sales cost of merchandise sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other income  net loss from operations of stores closed in 
table of contents operating losses from closed stores include the following store closing and asset impairment charges in thousands lease termination costs asset impairment charges severance total year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales for the year ended january  were  million  down percent from  million for the prior year 
the million decrease reflects a million decrease in the comparable store group and a million decrease in the closed store group  offset by a million increase in the non comparable store group due to the inclusion of sales for the two stores opened in and the six stores opened in the closed store group includes the stores closed in and stores closed in comparable stores sales for decreased percent compared to although sales decreased in  gross profit for year ended january  increased to million or percent of net sales from million or percent of net sales for the prior year 
the million increase in gross profit reflects a million increase in the comparable store group and a million increase in the non comparable store group  partially offset by a million decrease in the closed store group 
gross profit as a percent of sales increased during fiscal due to a percentage point decrease in markdowns and a percentage point increase in markup  offset by a percentage point decrease in buying and occupancy costs 
markdowns were lower in due to lower inventory levels and lower levels of clearance merchandise 
sg a expenses were million or percent of net sales for the year ended january  as compared to million or percent of net sales for sg a expenses for include million of non cash pre tax asset impairment and store closing charges compared to million in asset impairment charges were million higher last year due to a greater number of stores with projected cash flows that did not support the carrying value of their long lived assets 
store closing charges were million higher last year because two closings occurred before the end of the lease term resulting in higher store closing reserve charges for continuing lease obligations 
excluding asset impairment and store closing charges  sg a expenses were million or percent of sales in compared to million or percent of sales in this million decrease in sg a expenses reflects a million reduction in store operating expenses  a million decrease in non buying expenses in the corporate office  a million decrease in depreciation expense and a million decrease in advertising expense 
store operating expenses decreased million for the comparable and non comparable store group due to headcount reductions and other cost saving initiatives and decreased million for the closed store group 
corporate office expenses decreased from primarily due to compensation and benefit reductions related to expense reduction initiatives and lower consulting fees 
depreciation expense decreased as a result of asset impairment charges taken during the fourth quarter of advertising expense was slightly lower this year primarily due to reduced spending on direct mail marketing and newspaper advertising 
pre opening expenses for the two stores opened in and the six stores opened in amounted to million and million  respectively 
other income  net decreased million in compared to due to a decrease in the number of credit cards issued through our co brand credit card program offset slightly by income from our new magazine subscription program 
interest expense  net decreased million in compared to as a result of our having no direct borrowings since the first quarter of during the third quarter of  we borrowed an additional million on our revolving credit agreement which increased our notes payable to banks balance to million 
we maintained that notes payable balance through january   investing excess borrowings in short term money market funds  and liquidated these money market funds and repaid that portion of the borrowings during the first quarter of the effective tax rate etr was percent in compared to a tax benefit of percent in the rate was unusually low due to our recording a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance through a charge to tax expense during the fourth quarter of we recorded the valuation allowance because operating results produced a cumulative three year loss  which is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome when determining if a valuation allowance is required 
although we were profitable in  we remain in a cumulative three year loss 
we perform a quarterly assessment of net deferred tax assets 
table of contents and plan to carry a valuation allowance until such time that positive evidence is sufficient to justify realization 
the etr was lower than the federal statutory rate of percent due to the effect of certain book tax differences on the valuation allowance including a tax accounting method change made in the third quarter of year ended january  compared to year ended february  net sales for the year ended january  were  million  down percent from  million for the prior year 
the million decrease reflects a million decrease in the comparable store group and a million decrease in the closed store group  offset by a million increase in the non comparable store group due to the inclusion of sales for the stores opened in and the six stores opened in the closed store group includes the ten stores closed in and the two stores closed in comparable stores sales for decreased percent compared to gross profit for year ended january  was million or percent of net sales compared to million or percent of net sales for the million decrease in gross profit reflects a million decrease in the comparable store group and a million decrease in the closed store group  partially offset by a million increase in the non comparable store group due to the inclusion of operating results for the stores opened in and the six stores opened in gross profit as a percent of sales decreased during fiscal due to a percentage point increase in markdowns and a percentage point increase in buying and occupancy costs  offset by a percentage point increase in markup 
sg a expenses were million or percent of net sales for the year ended january  as compared to million or percent of net sales for sg a expenses for include million of primarily non cash pre tax asset impairment and store closing charges compared to million in asset impairment charges were million higher in due to a greater number of stores with projected cash flows that do not support the carrying value of their long lived assets 
store closing charges increased million over last year because ten stores were closed in compared to only two store closings in excluding asset impairment and store closing charges  sg a expenses were million or percent of sales in compared to million or percent of sales in this million decrease in sg a expenses resulted primarily from significant reductions in advertising and store operating expenses  somewhat offset by professional fees related to expense reduction initiatives 
advertising expenses decreased million in due primarily to reduced broadcast media 
store operating expenses decreased million for the comparable store group due to cost saving initiatives and decreased million for the closed store group  but were offset by an million increase for the non comparable store group due to the inclusion of operating results for the stores opened in and the six stores opened in corporate sg a expenses were higher in primarily due to professional fees related to ongoing expense reduction initiatives and higher benefit costs  while last year included million of separation costs for the resignation of the former president chief executive officer 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales were higher this year due to a lack of leverage on lower sales 
pre opening expenses for the six stores opened in and the stores opened in amounted to million and million  respectively 
other income  net decreased million in compared to due to decreases in credit card income and shoe department income  both resulting from the decreased net sales 
interest expense  net increased million during compared to due to higher borrowings at lower interest rates this year compared to last year 
during the third quarter of  we borrowed an additional million on our revolving credit agreement which increased our notes payable to banks balance to million 
we maintained that notes payable balance through january   investing excess borrowings in short term money market funds 
subsequent to year end  we liquidated these money market funds and repaid that portion of its borrowings 
the effective income tax benefit decreased from percent in to percent in primarily due to recording a million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of asc topic  income taxes  requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook  and although we were profitable in and posted a small loss in  the results in produced a cumulative three year loss  which is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome 
accordingly  we established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million through a charge to tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is the sale of merchandise inventories 
capital requirements and working capital needs are funded 
table of contents through a combination of internally generated funds  a revolving credit facility and credit terms from vendors 
working capital is needed to support store inventories and capital investments for new store openings and to maintain existing stores 
historically  our working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and highest in either the third or fourth quarter in anticipation of the fourth quarter peak selling season 
as of january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and no direct borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by operating activities increased million over the increase was primarily due to million more cash provided by net income plus non cash charges and a million increase in cash provided by income taxes receivable payable including million of net operating loss carry back refunds primarily related to our federal tax return received during  offset by million more cash used for inventories and accounts payable and million more cash used by other operating activities 
while the end of year inventory balance is only slightly higher compared to  accounts payable is much higher at the end of primarily due to approximately million of merchandise in distribution centers at the end of that was received earlier than at the end of as part of our new supply chain network 
operating cash flows for increased million from primarily due to million less cash used for inventories  a million decrease in cash used for income taxes receivable payable and million more cash provided by other operating activities  offset by million less cash provided by net loss plus non cash charges and million more cash used to reduce accounts payable 
less cash was needed for income taxes in due to a significant income tax receivable recorded at february  inventories decreased in compared to due to lower sales resulting in less inventory being purchased and lower inventory levels 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for each year reflect a decrease in the number of store openings each year 
the net liquidation of short term investments provided million of cash in net cash used in provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in more cash was used in financing activities during due to the repayment of all direct borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
more cash was provided by financing activities during primarily due to higher net borrowings  no cash dividends paid and fewer shares of common stock repurchased compared to in february  the board of directors suspended the payment of a quarterly dividend 
we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in the cost of opening a new store ranges from  to  for fixtures  equipment  leasehold improvements and pre opening costs primarily advertising  stocking and training 
pre opening costs are expensed at the time of opening 
initial inventory investment for a new store is approximately  we have a million senior revolving secured credit agreement the agreement with a group of lenders 
in january  we extended the agreement for one additional year through january as of january   availability under the agreement was million and is based on eligible inventory less other reserves as defined in the agreement 
outstanding letters of credit of million reduced availability for borrowings to million at january  we had no direct borrowings at january  and we are in compliance with the terms of the agreement 
we believe that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations  which  along with our available cash and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement  will provide the means needed to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
while we have available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement  tightening of the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through public or private equity or debt financing 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at january  in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase obligations a total a represent open purchase orders with vendors for merchandise not yet received and recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
the above table does not include long term debt as we did not have any direct borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility at january  other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  deferred 
table of contents compensation  deferred rent liability  postretirement benefit liability and other long term liabilities that do not have specific due dates  so are excluded from the preceding table 
other long term liabilities also include long term store closing reserves  a component of which is future minimum payments under non cancelable leases for closed stores 
these future minimum lease payments total million and are included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements we have outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million securing certain insurance programs at january  if certain conditions were to occur under these arrangements  we would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  we do not expect to make any payments  therefore  the letters of credit are excluded from the preceding table 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements that could affect our financial condition 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature with a higher percentage of our sales during the fourth quarter holiday selling season 
accordingly  sg a expenses are typically higher as a percent of net sales during the first three quarters of each year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require adjustments of these estimates in future periods 
following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies retail inventory method and inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
the use of rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail values of inventories 
based on a review of historical markdowns  current business trends and seasonal inventory categories  additional inventory reserves may be recorded to reflect estimated markdowns which may be required to liquidate certain inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes its inventory valuation methods approximate the net realizable value of clearance inventory and result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we perform physical inventory counts at all stores annually 
included in the carrying value of merchandise inventories is a reserve for shrinkage 
shrinkage is estimated based on historical physical inventory results as a percentage of sales for the year 
the difference between actual and estimated amounts in any year may cause fluctuations in quarterly results  but is not a factor in full year results 
vendor allowances 
we receive allowances from some of our vendors primarily related to markdown reimbursement  damaged defective merchandise and vendor compliance issues 
vendor allowances are recorded when earned 
allowances received from vendors related to profitability of inventory recently sold are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold in the later of the period that the merchandise markdown is incurred or the allowance is negotiated 
allowances received from vendors related to damaged defective inventory are reflected as reductions to the cost of merchandise as it is received 
allowances received due to compliance issues primarily violations of shipping and merchandise preparation requirements are reflected as a reduction of the cost of the merchandise when compliance issues are identified during the receiving process 
although it is unlikely that there will be a significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support  if a reduction were to occur  we could experience higher cost of merchandise sold 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
for long lived assets held for use  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets 
impairment reviews are performed for individual stores during the fourth quarter  or more frequently should circumstances change 
a significant change in cash flows or estimated market values could result in an increase in asset impairment charges 
during  we recorded million in pre tax asset impairment charges related to stores closed in  stores closing in and certain other under performing stores 

table of contents store closing costs 
we record costs associated with store closing activities when they are incurred  generally the cease use date 
lease termination costs are recorded net of estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained for the properties 
in the event we are not successful in subleasing closed store locations  additional store closing costs may be recorded 
insurance reserves 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by the covered employees 
we are responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are estimated actuarially  based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions 
as of january  and january   insurance reserves of million and million  respectively  were included in accrued liabilities 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in trends and other actuarial assumptions have not been significant in  and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
income tax accounting guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets because operating results produced a cumulative three year loss  which is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome when determining if a valuation allowance is required 
although we were profitable in  we remain in a cumulative three year loss 
we perform a quarterly assessment of net deferred tax assets and plan to carry a valuation allowance until such time that positive evidence is sufficient to justify realization 
the valuation allowance was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
income tax reserves 
we record liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to federal and state income taxes 
these liabilities reflect our best estimate of our ultimate income tax liability based on the tax code  regulations  and pronouncements of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
estimating our ultimate tax liability involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions 
if actual results differ from estimated results  our effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification asc as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
this guidance  which was incorporated into asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles  is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of the guidance during our third quarter of changed certain disclosure references to us gaap  but did not have any other impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance impacting the determination of when individual deliverables included in an arrangement with multiple deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting 
the guidance  which was incorporated into asc topic  revenue recognition  eliminates the residual method of allocation for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   however early adoption is permitted 
we use this guidance to account for our co brand credit card consumer program agreement and we do not anticipate that adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effective february   we adopted the fair value measurement guidance as required by asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non recurring basis 
the adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our revolving credit facility which are at variable rates 
the facility permits debt commitments up to million  has a january maturity date and bears interest at spreads over the prime rate and libor 
at january   we had no direct borrowings under the facility 
for  average borrowings under our revolving credit facility were million 
if interest rates on average borrowings changed by basis points  our annual interest expense would change by  assuming comparable borrowing levels
