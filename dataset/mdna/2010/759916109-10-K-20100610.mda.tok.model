overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies that harness biological pathways and deliver value to patients and clinicians in neurology  gastroenterology and orphan diseases 
we are currently conducting a number of drug development programs for diseases such as pancreatitis  bipolar disorder  friedreich s ataxia and spinal muscular atrophy 
we also have a bioprocessing business that focuses on the development and commercialization of products that are used for the production of biopharmaceuticals 
in addition  we receive royalties from bristol myers squibb company bristol on their net sales in the united states of their product orencia 
total revenue in fiscal decreased significantly as compared to fiscal due to a decrease in our bioprocessing product sales as we experienced lower customer demand for our protein a products due to the current economic environment and a one time royalty payment from bristol recognized as revenue in the prior year 
we seek to invest the profits from our current commercial products and royalty and other revenues  as well as use our existing financial resources  to advance the development of our therapeutic product candidates and our bioprocessing business 
critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting polices are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements  we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition we generate product revenues from the sale of bioprocessing products to customers in the pharmaceutical and process chromatography industries 
we recognize revenue related to product sales upon delivery of the product to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
determination of whether these criteria have been met are based on management s judgments primarily regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for product delivered  and the collectability of those fees 
we have a few longstanding customers who comprise the majority of revenue and have excellent payment history and therefore we do not require collateral 
we have had no significant write offs of uncollectible invoices in the periods presented 

table of contents at the time of sale  we also evaluate the need to accrue for warranty and sales returns 
the supply agreements we have with our customers and related purchase orders identify the terms and conditions of each sale and the price of the goods ordered 
due to the nature of the sales arrangements  inventory produced for sale is tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
since the product is manufactured to order and in compliance with required specifications prior to shipment  the likelihood of sales return  warranty or other issues is largely diminished 
sales returns and warranty issues are infrequent and have had nominal impact on our financial statements historically 
in april  we settled our outstanding litigation with bristol and began recognizing royalty revenue in fiscal year for bristol s net sales in the united states of orencia which is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
pursuant to the bristol settlement  we recognized  in royalty revenue in fiscal  which included a million initial payment and million for sales of orencia prior to fiscal  in addition to royalties earned on sales of orencia during our fiscal we recognized  in royalty revenue for sales of orencia in fiscal revenue earned from bristol royalties is recorded in the periods when it is earned based on royalty reports sent by bristol to us 
we have no continuing obligations to bristol as a result of this settlement 
additionally  during fiscal years  and  we earned and recognized approximately   and  respectively in royalty revenue from chirhoclin for their sales of secretin 
revenue earned from chirhoclin royalties is recorded in the periods when it is earned based on royalty reports sent by chirhoclin to us 
as of december   chirhoclin has fulfilled its royalty obligations to us for its sales of secretin 
we do not expect to recognize any further royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
in fiscal  we recognized  and  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association mda and jointly with the friedreich s ataxia research alliance and the national ataxia foundation  respectively 
during fiscal  we recognized approximately  and  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association mda and comitato rudi onlus gofar gofar  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recognized  of revenue from a sponsored research and development project under an agreement with the stanley medical research institute 
research revenue is recognized when the expense has been incurred and services have been performed 
determination of which incurred costs qualify for reimbursement under the terms of our contractual agreements and the timing of when such costs were incurred involves the judgment of management 
our calculations are based upon the agreed upon terms as stated in the arrangements 
however  should the estimated calculations change or be challenged by other parties to the agreements  research revenue may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
the calculations have not historically changed or been challenged and we do not anticipate any subsequent change in revenue related to sponsored research and development projects 
there have been no material changes to our initial estimates related to revenue recognition in any periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
inventories inventories relate to our bioprocessing business 
we value inventory at cost or  if lower  fair market value using the first in  first out method 
we review our inventory at least quarterly and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on our estimates of expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates of raw materials  work in process and finished products 
expected sales volumes are determined based on supply forecasts provided by key customers for the next three to twelve months 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  and inventory in excess of expected requirements to cost of product revenue 
manufacturing of bioprocessing finished goods is done to order and tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 

table of contents a change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory quantities on hand 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or unexpected quality failures could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and reported operating results 
during all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements  there have been no material adjustments related to a revised estimate of inventory valuations 
business combinations amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  if any  based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions determined by management 
any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
the fair value of contingent consideration includes estimates and judgments made by management regarding the extent of royalties to be earned in excess of the defined minimum royalties 
management will update these estimates and the related fair value of contingent consideration at each reporting period 
accrued liabilities we estimate accrued liabilities by identifying services performed on our behalf  estimating the level of service performed and determining the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
these expenses are normally determined through a contract or purchase order issued by us  service fees paid to organizations for their performance in conducting clinical trials 
these expenses are determined by contracts in place for those services and communications with project managers on costs which have been incurred as of each reporting date  professional and consulting fees incurred with law firms  audit and accounting service providers and other third party consultants 
these expenses are determined by either requesting those service providers to estimate unbilled services at each reporting date for services incurred  or tracking costs incurred by service providers under fixed fee arrangements 
we have processes in place to estimate the appropriate amounts to record for accrued liabilities  which principally involve the applicable personnel reviewing the services provided 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  the reported expenses for that period may be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known at the date of the financial statements 
a change in the estimated cost or volume of services provided could result in additional accrued liabilities 
any significant unanticipated changes in such estimates could have a significant impact on our accrued liabilities and reported operating results 
there have been no material adjustments to our accrued liabilities in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards on the grant date 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from our historical stock option exercise experience and option expiration data 
the 
table of contents expected life of stock options granted is based on the simplified method 
accordingly  the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
in addition  for purposes of estimating the expected term  we have aggregated all individual option awards into one group as we do not expect substantial differences in exercise behavior among its employees 
the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of options granted 
we determined the expected volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term  exclusive of any events not reasonably anticipated to recur over the option s expected term 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the option s expected term on the grant date 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our capital stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period based upon options that are ultimately expected to vest  and accordingly  such compensation expense has been adjusted by an amount of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered option 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on an analysis of historical data  we have calculated an annual forfeiture rate for non executive level employees  a annual forfeiture rate for executive level employees  and a forfeiture rate for non employee members of the board of directors  which we believe is a reasonable assumption to estimate forfeitures 
however  the estimation of forfeitures requires significant judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
for the years ended march   and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately   and  respectively  for stock options granted under the second amended and restated repligen corporation stock plan the plan 
as of march   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based awards 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining requisite service period of years 
we expect  in unvested options to vest over the next five years 
results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and the related footnotes thereto 
revenues total revenues for fiscal  and were   and  respectively  and were primarily comprised of sales of our bioprocessing products and royalties 
our total revenue was comprised of year ended march  change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages bioprocessing secreflo product revenue royalty and other revenue total revenue 
table of contents substantially all of our bioprocessing products are based on recombinant protein a and are sold to customers who incorporate our manufactured products into their proprietary antibody purification systems to be sold directly to the pharmaceutical industry 
monoclonal antibodies are a well established class of drug with applications in rheumatoid arthritis  asthma and a variety of cancers 
sales of our bioprocessing products are therefore impacted by the timing of large scale production orders and the regulatory approvals for such antibodies  which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations 
during fiscal  bioprocessing product sales decreased by  or as compared to fiscal volume decreased due to decreased demand from certain key customers in reaction to current economic conditions and other business events 
changes in the mix of products sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal comprised the remaining decrease 
we sell various bioprocessing products at various price points 
the mix of products sold varies and impacts the fluctuations in total product revenue and cost of product revenues from period to period 
during fiscal  bioprocessing product sales decreased by  or as compared to fiscal volume decreased due to decreased demand from certain key customers in reaction to the current credit crisis and other business events 
changes in the mix of products sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal comprised the remaining decrease 
we anticipate that bioprocessing product sales will increase in fiscal as our customers respond to an anticipated economic recovery during the year 
in addition  our bioprocessing product sales may be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of large scale production orders 
sales of secreflo decreased  in fiscal as we discontinued selling this product in the second quarter of fiscal the settlement in fiscal with our sole supplier of secreflo  chirhoclin  provided for a certain amount of vials of product that we could ultimately ship 
the final shipment of secreflo to us from chirhoclin was received in fiscal and we discontinued selling secreflo in the second quarter of fiscal pursuant to the bristol settlement as defined in note  we recognized royalty revenue of approximately  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the  recognized in fiscal included an initial million royalty payment  million in royalties for sales of orencia from january  to march   as well as million for sales in fiscal year for fiscal  we expect royalty revenues to increase moderately over fiscal as bristol s orencia continues to penetrate the market 
also  during fiscal years  and  we earned and recognized approximately   and  respectively  in royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
as of december   chirhoclin has fulfilled its royalty obligations to us for its sales of our secretin 
we do not expect to recognize any further royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
in fiscal  we recognized  and  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association mda and jointly with the friedreich s ataxia research alliance and the national ataxia foundation  respectively 
during fiscal  we recognized approximately  and  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the mda and comitato rudi onlus gofar gofar  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recognized  of revenue from a sponsored research and development project under an agreement with the stanley medical research institute 
we expect research and license revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal as the mda grant related effort continues 

table of contents costs and operating expenses total costs and operating expenses for fiscal  and consist of the following year ended march  change vs 
vs 
in thousands costs and operating expenses cost of product revenue cost of royalty and other revenue research and development selling  general and administrative net gain from litigation settlement total costs and operating expenses the decrease in cost of product revenue of  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in bioprocessing product sales as well as favorable manufacturing variances 
this decrease is partially offset by higher depreciation costs of approximately  related to investments in our manufacturing facilities 
the decrease in cost of product revenue of  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in bioprocessing sales 
this decrease was partially offset by increased direct labor costs of approximately  due primarily to additional quality assurance and control personnel hired to meet growing customer demand for increased product quality assurance efforts and to support iso certification 
it was also partially offset by higher depreciation and occupancy costs of approximately  primarily associated with our manufacturing and administrative expansion at a second site located in waltham  ma 
pursuant to the bristol settlement  we must remit of royalty revenue received through the expiration of the agreement in december  after deducting certain allowable legal and other costs  to the university of michigan 
for fiscal and  this cost of royalty revenue was approximately  and  respectively 
this increase is directly related to the increase in bristol royalty revenue noted above 
research and development costs primarily include costs of internal personnel  external pharmacology and toxicology research  clinical trials and the costs associated with the manufacturing and testing of clinical materials 
we currently have ongoing clinically enabled research and development programs that support our secretin and uridine product candidates 
in addition  we are pursuing pre clinical activities in friedreich s ataxia and spinal muscular atrophy that may or may not be further developed 
due to the small size of the company and the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs  we do not track all our expenses or allocate any fixed costs by program  and therefore  have not provided an estimate of historical costs incurred by project 
each of our therapeutic research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals that are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research programs  particularly in our early stage programs must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
for example  results from our preclinical animal models may not be replicated in our clinical trials with humans 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion date of these programs 
these risks and uncertainties also prevent us from estimating with any certainty the specific timing and future costs of our research and development programs  although historical trends within the industry suggest that 
table of contents expenses tend to increase in later stages of development 
collaborations with commercial vendors and academic researchers accounted for   and of our research and development expenses for fiscal   and  respectively 
the outsourcing of such services provides us flexibility to discontinue or increase spending depending on the success of our research and development programs 
during fiscal  research and development expenses increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is comprised primarily of  related to our new dcps program to develop a drug for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy   related to friedreich s ataxia as we identified a clinical candidate and began preparing for a phase clinical trial and  related to increased personnel expenses primarily due to headcount additions in clinical and regulatory areas 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease as we approached the end of our phase clinical trial for rg  evaluating the use of human secretin in aiding pancreatic imaging 
during fiscal  research and development expenses increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase was comprised primarily of  related to the continued phase clinical trial for rg  evaluating the use of human secretin in pancreatic imaging   related to the phase b clinical trial for rg  evaluating the use of uridine to treat bipolar depression and  related to friedreich s ataxia as we continued to search for a clinical candidate 
additionally  there were increased personnel expenses of  primarily due to headcount additions in clinical  regulatory and research and development areas 
future research and development expenses are dependent on a number of variables  including the cost and design of clinical trials and external costs such as manufacturing of clinical materials 
we expect our research and development expenses in fiscal to decrease moderately primarily due to the secretin clinical trial ending in fiscal  the timing of certain expenditures associated with our friedreich s ataxia program for which we recently filed an ind application with the fda  partially offset by increased spending on our dcps program for treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy 
in addition  we will have a re analysis performed on the images obtained from our phase clinical trial for secretin to improve pancreatic diagnostic imaging and anticipate that preliminary results will be available by the end of fiscal year  ending on march  we will continue our phase b clinical trial for uridine to treat bipolar depression and anticipate that preliminary results will also be available by the end of fiscal year there may be further increases in expenses if we acquire additional product candidates 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include the associated costs with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our research and development efforts including legal  accounting  patent  shareholder services and other administrative functions 
in addition  sg a expenses have historically included costs associated with various litigation matters 
in fiscal  sg a costs increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased personnel expenses of  primarily due to headcount increases in marketing and business development including salaries and stock based compensation 
during fiscal  sg a costs decreased by  or as compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily due to  of litigation costs incurred in fiscal relating to the bristol and imclone settlements  and a  decrease in recruiting and relocation costs as certain key board and management positions were filled in fiscal these decreases are partially offset by increased personnel expenses of  primarily due to headcount increases in marketing and business development including salaries and stock based compensation 
we expect sg a expenses to increase moderately in fiscal primarily due to slightly higher headcount and related personnel expenses 

table of contents net gain from litigation settlement on september   repligen and mit entered into the imclone settlement relating to the lawsuit against imclone for infringement of the patent 
pursuant to the imclone settlement  imclone made a payment of million to repligen and mit that resulted in net proceeds to repligen of  after litigation costs of  and proceeds to mit of  the imclone settlement served as the basis to dismiss the lawsuit against imclone and for repligen to grant imclone a non exclusive sublicense to the patent and certain other intellectual property 
investment income investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances 
investment income for fiscal  and was approximately   and  respectively 
the decrease of  or in fiscal compared to fiscal and the decrease of  or in fiscal compared to fiscal are primarily attributable to lower interest rates resulting from overall economic conditions 
we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates 
benefit from income taxes in fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  primarily due to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act that was enacted in november among other things  the act suspended the limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset alternative minimum tax liabilities  which we expect will enable us to recover  of alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years 
as a result  the company had an effective tax rate of negative 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities  revenues derived from product sales  and research grants  as well as proceeds and royalties from litigation settlements 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to our bioprocessing product revenue  royalties from bristol  and research and development grants 
given the uncertainties related to pharmaceutical product development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our therapeutic product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows

financing activities in fiscal  exercises of stock options provided cash receipts of  in fiscal  the repurchase of common stock consumed  and exercises of stock options provided cash receipts of off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations as of march   we had the following fixed obligations and commitments payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations contractual obligations total these amounts include obligations for minimum contingent consideration from acquisitions as well as for license  supply and consulting agreements 
capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of our clinical studies  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  our ability to acquire additional products or product candidates  
table of contents the extent of any share repurchase activity  the success of any proposed financing efforts  and the ability to sustain sales and profits of our bioprocessing products  and the amount of royalty revenues we receive from bristol 
absent acquisitions of additional products  product candidates or intellectual property  we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next twenty four months 
we expect to incur moderately increased expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal this is primarily due to increases in cost of product revenue associated with higher anticipated product revenue  increased personnel expenses  offset by moderately lower research and development costs 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued investment in our research and development programs  the acquisition of additional products and technologies to complement our manufacturing capabilities  capital expenditures primarily associated with purchases of equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio 
we plan to continue to invest in key research and development activities 
we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis  including licensing or acquiring complementary products  technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio of development programs 
we continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders 
in order to acquire such assets  we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments 
this may require the issuance or sale of additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
should we need to secure additional financing to acquire a product  fund future investment in research and development  or meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace 
net operating loss carryforwards at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and business tax credits carryforwards of approximately  available to reduce future federal income taxes  if any 
additionally  at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and business tax credits carryforwards of approximately  available to reduce future state income taxes  if any 
the net operating loss and business tax credits carryforwards will continue to expire at various dates through march net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders 
in fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  primarily due to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act that was enacted in november among other things  the act suspended the limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset alternative minimum tax liabilities  and will enable us to receive a refund of  for alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years 
in fiscal and  we utilized our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our income tax provision 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have investments in commercial paper  us government and agency securities as well as corporate bonds and other debt securities 
as a result  we are exposed to potential loss from market risks that may occur as a result of changes in interest rates  changes in credit quality of the issuer or otherwise 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of march  we believe  however  that the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure  and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer with the exception of us agency obligations and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited 
we intend to hold the majority of our investments to maturity  in accordance with our business plans
