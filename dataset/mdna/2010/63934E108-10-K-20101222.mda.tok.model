executive summary for  we recognized million of net income attributable to navistar international corporation in spite of continued industry volume lows 
contributing to our profitability were sales of military vehicles  stable market share of our commercial products  an increase in engine segment sales in south america  lower manufacturing and material costs  and improved operating efficiencies 
our performance was further driven by increased commercial sales within north america for our parts segment and improved results of our financial services segment 
during  we remained profitable despite continued industry volume lows within our u 
s and canada school bus and class through medium and heavy truck traditional markets 
as the us and global markets continue their recovery from the recession  we believe there will be a continued gradual increase in industry units in compared to the depressed volumes of  in and  in building off a slight pre buy in early related to the new epa emissions requirements  we further benefited from increases in traditional industry units throughout the year  which coupled with increases in our expansionary business and our continued strong market share performance  drove volume growth for in addition  us military orders for mrap vehicles  which have higher associated revenue per unit  positively impacted our performance 
we expect the traditional truck industry retail deliveries to be in the range of  units to  units for we continue to invest in research  development  and tooling equipment to design and produce our engine product lines to meet epa emissions requirements 
we have chosen advanced egr  combined with other strategies  as our solution to meet the emissions requirements 
we believe coupling egr with other emissions strategies gives our products advantages over our competitors liquid based urea scr solution and enables us to maintain flexibility in meeting emissions requirements 
we continue to evaluate our emissions strategies on a platform by platform basis to achieve the best long term solution for our customers in each of our vehicle applications 
our continued investment in research and development includes the further enhancement of our advanced egr technology and the ongoing development of reliable  high quality  high performance  and fuel efficient products 
building on our actions to adjust our capital structure  our financial services segment continued to address future liquidity needs throughout in addition to various refinancing and securitization actions made during the year  we entered into a three year operating agreement with ge capital corporation and ge capital commercial  inc collectively ge whereby ge became our preferred source of retail customer financing for equipment offered by us and our dealers in the us we also amended the terms of our wholesale trust agreement  which resulted in the consolidation of the master trust 
business outlook and key trends for our truck segment  we expect benefits from further improvements in our traditional volumes as the industry continues to increase from the lows experienced in and in the us market  the average age of the truck fleet of years in was the highest since  according to act research  and we anticipate 
table of contents higher sales in for truck replacement as our customers refresh aging fleets 
we also expect demand for trucks to increase as freight rates and volumes continue to improve as the economy recovers 
in addition to increased demand  we expect to further benefit from improved revenues and margins associated with our emissions compliant products 
in october  our uaw represented employees ratified a new four year labor agreement that provides us additional flexibility in manufacturing decisions and included provisions that allow for the wind down of uaw positions at our fort wayne facility 
in the future  we expect to realize benefits from this contract  as well as our other plant optimization actions taken during the trough of the truck cycle 
finally  we anticipate positive contributions from business acquisitions and investments also made during this period 
within our engine segment  we expect our south american operations to continue to be a key contributor to overall sales and profitability 
as markets continue to improve in north america  we anticipate further increases in our intercompany sales to our truck segment  driven by sales of our maxxforce and engines and the upcoming launch of our maxxforce engine  as well as additional oem sales for commercial  consumer  and specialty vehicle products 
beginning in  maxxforce engines were used in the entire north america vehicle offering of our truck segment as compared to outside sourcing for various model engines in prior years 
we have made investments in engineering and product development for our emissions compliant engines and we expect to continue to make significant investments in attaining the nitrogen oxide nox emissions levels  as well as for other product innovations  cost reductions  and fuel usage efficiencies 
as freight rates and volumes increase in conjunction with the economic recovery  we expect our parts segment volumes will continue to improve within our commercial markets in the us and canada 
in addition  we anticipate incremental parts sales as the overall age of the us truck fleet continues to rise as well as parts sales driven by the fulfillment of additional military orders 
while we also expect improvements within our global markets  we will experience rest of world row reported sales declines in and beyond as sales in certain markets are transitioned to our nc joint venture 
certain trends have affected our results of operations for as compared to and in addition  we expect that certain key trends will impact our future results of operations 
some of these factors are as follows traditional truck market the traditional truck markets in which we compete are typically cyclical in nature and are strongly influenced by macro economic factors such as industrial production  demand for durable goods  capital spending  oil prices and consumer confidence 
global economy the global economy  and in particular the economies in the us and brazil markets  are showing signs of recovery  and the related financial markets have stabilized 
the impact of the economic recession and financial turmoil on the global markets pose a continued risk as customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news and or declines in income or asset values 
lower demand for our customers products or services could also have a material negative effect on the demand for our products 
in addition  there could be exposure related to the financial viability of certain key third party suppliers  some of which are our sole source for particular components 
lower expectations of growth and profitability have resulted in impairments of long lived assets in the past and we could continue to experience pressure on the carrying values of our assets if conditions persist for an extended period of time 
military sales in  we continued to leverage existing products and plants to meet the urgent demand of the us military and our north atlantic treaty organization nato allies 
our us military sales were billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively  and consisted of mrap vehicles  lower cost militarized commercial trucks to the us and nato allies  and sales of parts and services to the us military 
in the first quarter of  we completed delivery of all remaining mrap orders to the us military 
in  we received additional orders for mraps and completed delivery in the third quarter 
in november  we received an order for mrap recovery vehicles and in december  we received an order for mrap dash vehicles 
we expect these units to be delivered in we continue to expect that over the long term our military business will generate approximately billion to billion in annual sales 

table of contents worldwide engine unit sales our worldwide engine unit sales are impacted primarily by north america truck demand and sales in south america  our largest engine market outside of the north american market 
these markets are impacted by consumer demand for products that use our engines as well as macro economic factors such as oil prices and construction activity 
our worldwide engine unit sales were  units in   units in  and  units in in  we settled our legal dispute with ford and continued our north american supply agreement for diesel engines with ford through december  as a result  our north american unit sales to ford were  units as compared to  units and  units for and  respectively 
we expect our worldwide engine unit sales to be primarily to our truck segment in north america and to external customers in south america 
emissions standards technology we have chosen advanced egr  combined with other technologies  as our solution to meet the emissions standards 
we believe coupling egr with other emissions strategies gives our products advantages over our competitors liquid based urea scr solution and enables us to maintain flexibility in meeting emission requirements 
our emissions strategy places the burden and responsibility of meeting the emissions standards on the company versus our competitors liquid based urea scr solution that places that burden on the customer 
we believe that our customer friendly solution provides our products with a significant competitive advantage in north america  because most truck and engine manufacturers have chosen liquid based urea scr as the solution to meet emission standards 
in  all of our maxxforce engines were certified to be compliant with emissions standards through the use of credits and nox emissions 
we continue to evaluate our emissions strategies on a platform by platform basis to achieve the best long term solution for our customers in each of our vehicle applications 
our continued investment in research and development includes the further enhancement of our advanced egr technology to reach nox emissions as well as the ongoing development of reliable  high quality  high performance  and fuel efficient products 
warranty costs we launched our emissions compliant engines during emissions regulations in the us and canada have resulted in rapid product development cycles  driving significant changes from previous engine models 
historically warranty experience for launch year engines has been higher compared to the prior model year engines  however  over time we are able to refine both the design and manufacturing process to reduce both the volume and the severity of warranty claims 
we have made substantial investments of engineering  product development  and testing within our emissions compliant engines to mitigate some of the warranty exposure 
while we believe warranty costs per unit for emissions compliant engines will be somewhat higher compared to pre emissions compliant engines  we believe that our actions will result in reduced exposure compared to previous launches 
also contributing to the expectation of higher warranty costs in is the use of all maxxforce engines in our north america product offering compared to previous outside sourcing for various engine models in which warranty costs were included in the engine purchase price 
liter liter engine strategy in conjunction with our egr strategy for compliance with the emissions standards  we only offer vehicles equipped with maxxforce engines in the us and canada 
for our class heavy and severe service lines  we offer our maxxforce and liter engines  and will launch our maxxforce engine in the company has taken significant strides to demonstrate to our customers that  in many applications  our maxxforce provides sufficient horsepower and torque 
in addition to the same or greater performance as a liter engine  our maxxforce has lower cost  increased fuel economy  and reduced weight 
changes in capital structure in october  we completed the sale of billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes and million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due the convertible notes 
the proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the billion loan facility due in the impact of issuing the new debt increased our interest expense in as compared to the convertible debt will impact our calculation of diluted earnings per share when our average stock price exceeds during the reporting period 
in december  we refinanced nfc s revolving credit facility with an million 
table of contents three year facility  and concurrently completed a private retail asset securitization and a fixed rate secured loan generating proceeds of million 
in addition  utilizing the us federal reserve s talf program  we completed the sale of million of three year investor notes in november and million of two year investor notes in february within our wholesale note funding facility 
in july  we amended the terms of our wholesale trust agreement  which resulted in the consolidation of the master trust 
as of july   effective with the amendment  master trust assets of approximately million  net of intercompany eliminations and retained interests previously carried on our consolidated balance sheet  and liabilities of approximately million  net of intercompany eliminations  were consolidated into the assets and liabilities of the company 
finally  we issued secured notes for million and million in may and october  respectively 
ge capital alliance in march  we entered into a three year operating agreement with ge 
under the terms of the agreement  ge became our preferred source of retail customer financing for equipment offered by us and our dealers in the us we provide ge a loss sharing arrangement for certain credit losses  and under limited circumstances nfc retains the rights to originate retail customer financing 
loan originations under the ge operating agreement began in the third quarter of  which will continue to reduce nfc originations and portfolio balances in the future 
we expect retail finance receivables and retail finance revenues to decline over the next five years as our retail portfolio pays down 
changes in credit markets throughout  the credit markets substantially stabilized and recovered but remain volatile in response to general economic weakness and uncertainty 
credit spreads  which generally represent the default risk component above the base interest rate that a lender charges its customer  remain at historically high levels but are currently lower than the unprecedented levels seen at the end of and early the higher credit spreads have been partially offset by lower base interest rates  which have remained stable throughout the numerous recent financing transactions in both the private and public markets  as well as our operating agreement with ge  demonstrate our ongoing access to liquidity 
in addition  our recent financing transactions have primarily been at fixed interest rates further mitigating our exposure to future volatility in credit spreads 
steel and other commodities commodity costs  which include steel  precious metals  resins  and petroleum products  decreased by million in  and increased by million and million in and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior years 
we are able to mitigate the effects of steel and other commodity cost increases through a combination of design changes  material substitution  alternate supplier resourcing  global sourcing efforts  pricing performance  and hedging activities 
although the terms of supplier contracts and special pricing arrangements can vary  a time lag exists between when our suppliers incur increased costs and when these costs are passed on to us as well as when we might recover them through increased pricing 
this time lag can span several quarters depending on the specific situation 
more recent trends indicate the cost pressures from the majority of our steel and commodity inputs have not only ceased  but have reversed 
however  we continued to experience higher commodity prices as compared to the overall industry decline as our prior actions to avoid the significant price increases have resulted in temporarily having slightly higher costs than the industry 
for  we anticipate increases in overall global commodity costs 
however  we plan to enhance our actions to mitigate exposure to commodity cost volatility by hedging a larger percentage of our anticipated commodity needs 
customer and transportation industry consolidations various transportation companies have been acquired  merged to form combined operating entities  or ceased operations 
although we are unable to determine the impact this industry consolidation will have with regard to future purchases or pricing of our trucks  engines and parts  certain of these newly combined entities have enjoyed increased purchasing power and contributed to lower demand for our products 
facilities optimization we continue to seek further opportunities for manufacturing and operating efficiencies within our facilities 
in early  we announced and implemented our plan to consolidate all bus production within our tulsa ic bus facility 
in september  we announced our intention to consolidate our executive management  certain business operations  and product development at a new 
table of contents million square foot world headquarters site in lisle  illinois  as well as a testing and validation center to be located within our melrose park facility 
in october  we completed certain tax exempt bond financings totaling million to be used for the purposes of financing the relocation of our headquarters and the development of certain industrial facilities  improvements  and equipment  and in november  we finalized the purchase of the property and buildings at the new world headquarters site 
we continue to develop plans for efficient transitions related to these activities and evaluate other options to continue the optimization of our operations and management structure 
joint ventures and other investments we continue to make substantial investments in joint ventures and other businesses that are considered key growth opportunities to our core operations  as well as important expansionary markets 
since inception  we have contributed approximately million to our joint ventures with mahindra mahindra ltd 
and caterpillar  which both recently launched new products 
in addition  we expect to finalize our joint ventures with jac in the company has also made recent acquisitions that present opportunities to further vertically integrate our operations and our product offerings including  continental mixer in and ppt and monaco in results of operations and segment results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations and illustrates the key financial indicators used to assess our consolidated financial results

chargeouts of our traditional units were  units higher  as compared to the prior year  with a greater mix of class heavy trucks contributing to higher overall revenue 
we experienced market share improvements in class and medium and maintained strong market share in our other traditional classes 
further contributing to the increase were improved row sales driven by the strengthening global economy  as well as the impact of consolidating our bdt operations 
partially offsetting the increase in segment sales was a decrease within our defense business  primarily as a result of lower sales of higher revenue per unit military vehicles driven by the timing of prior year deliveries to the us military 
engine segment sales increased million compared to the prior year  primarily due to increased engine sales in south america  the impact of consolidating our bdp operations  and increased intercompany activity 
these increases were partially offset by the expiration of our contract with ford to supply diesel engines for their f series and e series vehicles in the us and canada  resulting in a decrease of  units sold to ford in as compared to the prior year 
parts segment sales decreased million compared to the prior year  largely because of declines in us military sales which were the result of the fulfillment of higher military vehicle fielding orders in the prior year 
lower military sales were partially offset by improvements in our commercial markets in the u 
s as well as increased row sales 
financial services segment revenues decreased million compared to the prior year  primarily reflecting declines in average finance receivables of million 
the declines in average finance receivable balances represent the effect of a reduction in loan originations due to the economic environment in the us and mexico markets in   and  as well as customer payments on existing balances and originations under the ge operating agreement 
costs of products sold consistent with increased sales and revenues  costs of products sold increased by million compared to the prior year 
the impact on costs of products sold from increased overall revenues included higher traditional unit chargeouts  increased engine segment shipments  the impact of consolidating our bdp and bdt operations  and the prior year acquisition of monaco 
partially offsetting these increases were manufacturing cost efficiencies in our class heavy truck and school bus product lines  lower net adjustments of accruals for pre existing warranty  and improved material costs 
excluding the reversal of the warranty costs of million related to the ford settlement in  product warranty costs  including extended warranty program costs and net of vendor recoveries product warranty costs  decreased by million due to higher pre existing warranty adjustments and higher costs per unit in emissions regulations in the us and canada have resulted in rapid product development cycles  driving significant changes from previous engine models and requiring new emissions compliant products that are more complex and

furthermore  the increase in our incentive compensation and profit sharing expenses reflects our improved performance and our actual performance compared to our management incentive targets 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in our postretirement benefits expenses  lower dealcor expenses due to the sale of certain company owned dealerships and lower costs at our remaining facilities  as well as continued focus on our cost reduction initiatives

table of contents segment sales truck segment sales increased by million as compared to the prior year largely as a result of higher unit volume in our commercial business partially offset by a decrease in defense sales 
our commercial business sales increased primarily as a result of increases in our traditional business  and further benefited from an increase in the average sales price across all of our traditional classes due to favorable pricing and a shift in product mix 
our row sales improved largely due to the strengthening of the global economy  as well as the consolidation of our bdt operations that increased sales by million 
also contributing to the increase in sales was an improvement in used truck sales driven by increased demand and increases in used equipment prices  and the acquisition of monaco that resulted in additional sales of million for chargeouts of traditional units were  units higher in compared to the prior year  with a greater mix of class heavy and class severe service trucks contributing to higher overall revenue 
while chargeouts on our expansionary business including military increased by  units in aggregate as compared to the prior year  we were negatively impacted by the effects of product mix and lower sales of higher revenue per unit military vehicles driven by the timing of prior year deliveries to the us military 
segment profit truck segment profit increased by million as compared to the prior year  to million for the increase was primarily due to increased commercial chargeouts  as well as further material cost improvements and manufacturing efficiencies that translated into improved margins on our vehicles 
we further benefited from the stabilization of the used truck market and improved demand for used equipment 
in addition  engineering and product development costs decreased by million in primarily related to lower military vehicle development costs and we recognized impairment charges of million in related to changes in our business and volumes at the chatham and conway locations  that were not repeated in finally  we recognized a benefit in from a million reduction in reserves for certain value added taxes in brazil that were reassessed and determined to be recoverable 
partially offsetting the increase in segment profit were lower defense chargeouts primarily due to fewer orders from the u

segment revenues our financial services segment revenues declined as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease of million in the average finance receivable balance  to billion as of october  the decline in the average finance receivable balance was primarily due to customer payments and a reduction in financing originations as a result of fewer vehicle and service parts sales  and reflects the overall declining trend of financing originations whereby the retail portfolio has liquidated faster than new acquisitions have been financed 
furthermore  loan originations under the ge operating agreement began in the third quarter of  which will continue to reduce nfc originations and portfolio balances in the future 
partially offsetting the decline in loan originations was million of wholesale notes  less fair value discounts  resulting from the consolidation of the master trust as of july  wholesale note balances related to the master trust  less fair value discounts  were million at october  securitization income included in our financial services segment revenues decreased to million as of october  as a result of an adverse change in the fair value of our retained interests in sold receivables  as well as the consolidation of the master trust due to master trust income subsequent to july  being included in financing revenue rather than securitization income

table of contents truck segment sales decreased by in as compared to the prior year 
the primary drivers of the decrease were lower us military sales and a weak north american truck market 
decreased us military sales were driven by the deliveries of remaining mrap orders in early and were partially offset by increased sales of lower revenue per unit military vehicles to the us military and nato allies 
we experienced lower overall commercial chargeouts as a result of the weakness in the overall traditional industry  which more than offset the higher chargeouts from our class heavy trucks as a result of the success of our prostar trucks 
key economic indicators affecting the truck industry such as gross domestic product  industrial production  and freight tonnage hauled declined in as compared to the prior year  and we did not experience a substantial pre buy of pre emissions compliant engines in furthermore  our row sales were significantly affected in as we faced the global recession 
engine segment sales decreased by million  and total units shipped were down by  units in as compared to the prior year 
units shipped to ford in north america decreased by  units compared to the prior year as ford reduced its purchasing requirements 
furthermore  our south american sales were down  units in the reduction in units shipped to ford in north america was further exacerbated by the worst traditional north american truck market since as a result of the worldwide recession 
our parts segment sales increase was driven by us mrap service parts and other military service parts orders  which more than offset the adverse impacts of the economic recession on our commercial markets 
we experienced a sales decline within our commercial products  which is consistent with lower service repair demand due to poor economic conditions 
the lower tonnage hauled by freight carriers  coupled with eroding profitability  reduced our customers need and ability to buy service parts 
our financial services segment revenues decreased reflecting the decline in average finance receivables of million in as compared to  partially offset by an increase in securitization income driven by a decrease in discount rates 
the decline in average finance receivable balances reflected customer payments and a reduction in new financing opportunities resulting from fewer sales of vehicles and components due to reduced customer demand  which was driven by the difficult economic environment in the us and mexico markets 
costs of products sold costs of products sold decreased in as compared to the prior year  as a result of lower chargeouts and associated material purchases of commercial trucks and changes in mix of military products largely driven by a shift from higher cost vehicles manufactured for the us military to lower cost military trucks based on commercial platforms 
in addition  costs of products sold further decreased due to lower diesel engine and service parts deliveries to the commercial market that were offset partially by million of other ford related charges and higher direct material commodity costs 
we were not able to fully capitalize on some of the commodity cost savings experienced by the industry due to pre existing contractual obligations 
overall  those efforts delayed and reduced the higher expense that the industry had experienced in prior years 
costs related to steel  precious metals  resins and petroleum products increased by million in compared to an increase of million in product warranty costs decreased by million as compared to and were driven primarily by a reversal of million of product warranty costs related to the ford settlement 
in addition  the decrease in product warranty costs were the result of lower volumes and lower claims out of the contractual obligation period offset partially by adjustments to warranty accruals for changes in our estimates of warranty costs for products sold in prior years pre existing warranty of million and higher per unit costs 
excluding the reversal of the warranty costs related to the ford settlement  the increase in product warranty costs were due to higher pre existing warranty adjustments and higher per unit costs  which were primarily driven by us epa regulations that drove rapid product development cycles and resulted in significant changes from previous engine models 
the us epa regulations required new emission compliant products which were more complex and contain higher material costs 
consequently  repair costs have exceeded those that we had historically experienced 
in the past  our engines typically had a longer model lifecycle that afforded us the opportunity to refine both the design and manufacturing of the product to reduce both the volume and the severity of warranty claims 

table of contents restructuring charges restructuring charges relate to activities at our iep and icc locations in due to significant reductions from ford  we changed our business strategy regarding our manufacturing activities in our iep and icc locations while maintaining certain quality control and manufacturing engineering services

we had a significant reduction in professional expenses as we became a current sec filer in and made improvements in our accounting and control environment 
furthermore  dealcor expenses declined in following the sale of certain company owned dealerships and lower costs at our remaining locations 
the expense for incentive compensation and profit sharing reflected previously projected and actual performance compared to our management incentive targets at the respective year ends 
the decline in the provision for doubtful accounts was a result of the lower average finance receivable balances partially offset by an increase in our allowance ratio to outstanding finance receivables and loss reserves for specific customers as compared to during  repossessions and delinquencies began to decline due to the stabilization of the truck industry and the general economy 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in postretirement benefits expenses charged to selling  general and administrative expenses of million as compared to these increases were largely driven by a lower asset base at the beginning of as compared to  which is used to determine the total expected return for the fiscal year and is a component of net postretirement benefits expense  and a decrease in the expected return on assets for defined benefit plans resulting from lower plan assets 
in the first quarter of  we recognized million of expense for a curtailment and contractual termination benefits related to our indianapolis location 
during  we recognized a million gain related 
table of contents to a net settlement and curtailment of one of the plans resulting from certain plan changes that arose from the ratification of our uaw settlement 
see note  postretirement benefits  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
engineering and product development costs engineering and product development costs increased slightly in as compared to the prior year 
such costs were incurred by our truck and engine segments for product innovation and manufacturing cost reductions  and to provide our customers with product and fuel efficiencies 
engineering and product development costs incurred at the truck segment were million in  which compares to million incurred in  and related primarily to the further development of various military truck applications and emissions compliant products 
engineering and product development costs incurred at our engine segment were million in  which compares to million in this increase is a result of the efforts to develop our maxxforce engine and improving our egr and other technology in meeting the us epa emissions regulations 
interest expense the following table presents the components of interest expense change change in millions  except change manufacturing operations financial services operations derivative interest expense total the decrease in interest expense of million in as compared to the prior year primarily reflects lower debt balances and lower interest rates at our financial services segment  decreases in our variable interest rates on our manufacturing operations debt  and a reduction in derivative expense in debt balances at our financial services segment decreased as a result of lower average balances of our finance receivables

our income tax expense was affected by various items  including deferred tax asset valuation allowances principally domestic and canadian  research and development credits  medicare reimbursements  and other items 
a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance was adopted for the canadian operations as of october  accordingly  the operating loss in canada did not generate a deferred tax benefit in for additional information  see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
extraordinary gain  net of tax in  we completed the purchase of certain assets of the former rv manufacturing business of monaco coach corporation and created a new wholly owned affiliate company operating under the name of monaco rv  llc

table of contents segment sales truck segment sales decreased by billion from the prior year largely as a result of lower sales to the us military and lower sales of our commercial products 
sales to the us military decreased primarily due to the fulfillment our remaining mrap unit orders in early and were partially offset by increased sales of lower revenue per unit military vehicles to the us military and nato allies 
we also experienced lower commercial chargeouts as a result of weakness in the overall traditional industry 
however  we were able to mitigate some of the effects of the class heavy truck market decline as market acceptance led to higher chargeouts of our prostar products 
in addition  our school bus chargeouts increased as a result of major customers re timing their purchases from to chargeouts in our class and medium trucks were negatively impacted primarily by the declining economic conditions that dampened demand  as well as an influx of competitors with aggressive pricing strategies 
during  our school bus  class and medium truck  and combined class truck classes all led their markets with the greatest retail market share in each of their classes by brand 
our row sales declined by as compared to the prior year due to the downturn in demand in the global markets as we faced the global recession 
segment profit truck segment profit decreased by million as compared to the prior year primarily caused by decreased sales to the us military  lower traditional sales  and higher material costs as we continued to experience higher direct material commodity costs due to existing contractual obligations 
further contributing to the decrease was a million low volume penalty related to our bdt affiliate prior to its consolidation  impairment charges of million related to changes in our truck segment production facilities at our chatham and conway locations  and increased engineering and product development costs of million primarily related to increased military vehicle development costs 
partially offsetting the decrease in segment profit were decreased selling  general and administrative expenses of million and an extraordinary gain of million related to the acquisition of certain assets from monaco coach corporation in selling  general and administrative expenses declined due primarily to reductions in personnel to align with current market conditions and overhead and infrastructure in support of sales activities

selling  general and administrative costs declined in as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased legal expenses related to the ford litigation in the prior year and overall cost reduction measures actively pursued during partially offsetting these decreases were increased product warranty costs and increased engineering and product development costs 
excluding the reversal of million in warranty expense from the ford settlement  warranty costs increased by million in and were driven by higher costs per unit and an increase in our pre existing warranty reserves for products sold in prior periods

table of contents truck segment net orders we define net orders orders as written commitments received from customers and dealers during the year to purchase trucks 
orders represent new orders received during the year less cancellations of orders made during the same year 
orders do not represent guarantees of purchases by customers or dealers and are subject to cancellation 
orders may be either sold orders  which will be built for specific customers  or stock orders  which will generally be built for dealer inventory for eventual sale to customers 
these orders may be placed at our assembly plants in the us  mexico  and canada for destinations anywhere in the world and include trucks  buses  and military tactical vehicles 
historically  we have had an increase in net orders for stock inventory from our dealers at the end of the year due to a combination of demand or incentives to the dealers 
increases in stock orders typically translate to higher chargeouts for our truck segment and increased dealer inventory
