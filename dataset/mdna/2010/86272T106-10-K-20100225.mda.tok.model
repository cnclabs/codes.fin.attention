other departmental expenses 
other departmental expenses consist of general and administrative  marketing  repairs and maintenance  utilities and expenses related to earning other operating revenue 
management fees 
we pay base and incentive management fees to our hotel operators 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of revenue 
incentive management fees are incurred when operating profits exceed levels prescribed in our management agreements 
other hotel expenses 
other hotel expenses consist primarily of insurance costs and property taxes 
salaries  wages and related benefits are included within the categories of hotel operating expenses described above and represented approximately and of the total hotel operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
most categories of variable operating expenses  such as utilities and certain labor such as housekeeping  fluctuate with changes in occupancy 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs and expenses while increases in revpar attributable to increases in adr typically only result in increases in limited categories of operating costs and expenses  such as management fees charged by our operators  which are based on hotel revenues 
thus  changes in adr have a more significant impact on operating margins 
lease expense

impairment losses

as a result  lodging demand  which is primarily driven by the us gdp growth  business investment and employment growth  weakened 
we determined that these conditions have contributed to our low stock price and reduced market capitalization relative to the book value of our equity  which are indicators of potential impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
based on our evaluation  we recorded an estimated non cash goodwill impairment charge of million during the year ended december  an impairment test of long lived assets was performed for two mexican development sites at december  based on uncertainties surrounding the development of this land in a manner consistent with our original plan  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
an impairment test of long lived assets was performed for the renaissance paris hotel le parc trocadero renaissance paris at september  based on a change in the anticipated holding period of the hotel  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment charge due to an other than temporary decline in value of our investments in shc ksl partners  lp hotel venture  the owner of the hotel del coronado in san diego  california  and hdc north beach development  lllp north beach venture 
the estimates and assumptions made in assessing fair value of the reporting units  which for us is each of our hotel properties  and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties 
in addition  continued deterioration in economic and market conditions present a potential for
