table of contents the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the company s customer relationship management and systems 
there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately corrected by the company 
the occurrence of any such failures  interruptions or security breaches could damage the company s reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose the company to litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal control over financial reporting  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
the company maintains controls and procedures to mitigate against risks such as processing system failures and errors  and customer or employee fraud  and maintains insurance coverage for certain of these risks 
any system of controls and procedures  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
events could occur which are not prevented or detected by the company s internal controls or are not insured against or are in excess of the company s insurance limits 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may have underestimated losses on loans of the former county bank 
on february   the bank acquired approximately billion in assets  including loans  and billion in deposits of the former county bank  of merced  california  from the fdic as its receiver 
county bank s loan portfolio had suffered substantial deterioration over the previous year  and the company can provide no assurance that it will not continue to deteriorate now that it is part of the bank s portfolio 
if management s estimates of purchased loan fair values as of february  are higher than ultimate cash flows  the recorded carrying amount of the loans may need to be reduced with a corresponding charge to earnings  net of fdic loss indemnification 
shares of company common stock eligible for future sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for company common stock and could adversely affect the market price 
the articles of incorporation of the company authorize the issuance of million shares of common stock and two additional classes of million shares each  denominated class b common stock and preferred stock  respectively of which approximately million were outstanding at december  pursuant to its stock option plans  at december   the company had outstanding options exercisable for million shares of common stock 
as of december   million shares of company common stock remained available for grants under the company s stock option plans 
sales of substantial amounts of company common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of its common stock 
the company repurchases and retires its common stock in accordance with board of directors approved share repurchase programs 
at december   approximately million shares remained available to repurchase under such plans 
the company s payment of dividends on common stock could be eliminated or reduced 
holders of the company s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if declared by the company s board of directors 
although the company has historically paid cash dividends on the company s common stock  the company is not required to do so and the company s board of directors could reduce or eliminate the company s common stock dividend in the future 
the company could repurchase shares of its common stock at price levels considered excessive 
the company has been active in repurchasing and retiring shares of its common stock when alternative uses of excess capital  such as acquisitions  have been limited 
the company could repurchase shares of its common stock at price levels considered excessive  thereby spending more cash on such repurchases as deemed reasonable and effectively retiring fewer shares than would be retired if repurchases were affected at lower prices

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of westamerica bancorporation and subsidiaries the company that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages through  as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires the company to make certain estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses accounting and purchased loan accounting to be the accounting areas requiring the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
a discussion of the factors affecting accounting for the allowance for loan losses and purchased loans is included in the loan portfolio credit risk discussion below 
acquisition on february   westamerica bank bank acquired the banking operations of county bank county from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic

the results included a million charge for securities losses related to fhlmc and fnma preferred stock and other common stock 
additionally  results for included a million gain on the sale of visa common stock from visa s initial public offering ipo  million in reduced expenses as known litigation contingencies were satisfied as a part of the visa ipo  and approximately million reduction in the tax provision primarily due to adjusting the estimated tax provision to actual amounts on the filed federal tax return

declines on rates paid on deposits contributed to reduce the cost of funding as a percentage of earning assets from in to in offsetting some of the benefit of the expanding margin was the reduction in the level of average interest earning assets and lower yields on loans 
in management s opinion  current economic conditions are not conducive for generating profitable loan growth 
weak economic conditions create a cautious view toward commercial lending  and economic pressure on consumers has reduced demand for automobile and other consumer loans

loan portfolio credit risk the risk that loan customers do not repay loans granted by the bank is the most significant risk to the company 
the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and follows a strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk 
the bank s organization structure separates the functions of business development and loan underwriting  management believes this segregation of duties avoids inherent conflicts of combining the business development and loan approval functions 
in managing and measuring credit risk  management follows practices customary in the commercial banking industry 
the bank maintains a loan review department which reports directly to the board of directors 
the loan review department performs independent evaluations of loans and assigns credit risk grades to evaluated loans using grading standards employed by bank regulatory agencies 
those loans judged to carry higher risk attributes are referred to as classified loans 
classified loans receive elevated management s attention to maximize collection 
the bank maintains two loan administration offices whose sole responsibility is to manage and collect classified loans 
classified loans with higher levels of credit risk are further designated as nonaccrual loans 
management places loans on nonaccrual status when full collection of contractual interest and principal payments is in doubt 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
the company does not accrue interest income on nonaccrual loans 
interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the loan unless the carrying amount is well secured by loan collateral or covered by fdic loss sharing agreements 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans or more days past due and still accruing  and repossessed loan collateral 
on february   the bank purchased loans and repossessed loan collateral of the former county from the fdic 
this purchase transaction included loss sharing agreements with the fdic wherein the fdic and the bank share losses on the purchased assets 
the loss sharing agreements significantly reduce the credit risk of these purchased assets 
in evaluating credit risk  management bifurcates the bank s total loan portfolio between those loans qualifying under the fdic loss sharing agreements referred to as covered loans and loans not qualifying under the fdic loss sharing agreements referred to as non covered loans 
at december   covered loans totaled million  or percent of total loans  and non covered loans totaled billion  or percent of total loans 

table of contents covered loans and repossessed loan collateral covered assets covered loans and repossessed loan collateral qualify under loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic absorbs percent of losses and is entitled to percent of loss recoveries on the first million in losses on covered assets first tier  and absorbs percent of losses and is entitled to percent of loss recoveries exceeding million second tier 
the term of the loss sharing agreement on residential real estate assets is ten years  while the term for loss sharing on non residential real estate assets is five years in respect to losses and eight years in respect to loss recoveries 
the covered assets are primarily located in the california central valley  including merced county 
this geographic area currently has some of the weakest economic conditions within california and has experienced significant declines in real estate values 
management expects higher loss rates on covered assets than on non covered assets 
the bank recorded acquired covered assets at estimated fair value on the february  acquisition date 
the credit risk discount ascribed to the billion acquired loan and repossessed loan collateral portfolio was million representing estimated losses inherent in the assets at the acquisition date 
the bank also recorded a related receivable from the fdic in the amount of million representing estimated fdic reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements 
in management s judgment  the fair value discount recognized for the acquired assets remains adequate as an estimate of credit risk in covered assets as of december  in the event credit risk deteriorates beyond that estimated by management  losses in excess of the fair value credit discount would be recognized  net of related fdic loss indemnification 
the maximum risk to future earnings if first tier losses exceed management s estimated million in recognized losses under the fdic loss sharing agreements is estimated to be million as follows in thousands first tier loss coverage less recognized credit risk discount exposure to under estimated risk within firsttier bank loss sharing percentage percent first tier risk to bank  pre tax first tier risk to bank  after tax of the estimated million in recognized credit risk at february   the company has realized losses of million during the period february  through december  management has judged the likelihood of experiencing losses of a magnitude to trigger second tier fdic reimbursement as remote 
the bank s maximum after tax exposure to second tier losses is million as of december   which would be realized only if all covered assets at december  generated no future cash flows

non covered nonperforming assets could fluctuate from period to period 
the performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as the interest rate environment  economic conditions  collateral values or factors particular to the borrower 
no assurance can be given that additional increases in non covered nonaccrual loans will not occur in the future 

table of contents allowance for credit losses the company s allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating credit risk for loans  management measures loss potential of the carrying value of loans 
as described in the nonperforming loans section above  payments on nonaccrual loans may be applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
further  the carrying value of covered loans includes fair value credit risk discounts assigned at the time of purchase under the provisions of fasb asc  business combinations  and fasb asc  loans or debt securities with deteriorated credit quality 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses in excess of these reductions in carrying value 
management determined the fair value credit risk discounts assigned to covered loans purchased on february  remained adequate as an estimate of credit losses inherent in covered loans as of december  the following table summarizes the allowance for credit losses  chargeoffs and recoveries of the company for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands total non covered loans outstanding average non covered loans outstanding during the period analysis of the allowance balance  beginning of period provision for loan losses provision for unfunded credit commitments allowance acquired through merger loans charged off commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total chargeoffs recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total recoveries net loan losses balance  end of period components allowance for loan losses reserve for unfunded credit commitments allowance for credit losses net loan losses to average non covered loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non covered loans outstanding the company s non covered loans outstanding declined over the five years presented in the above table 
during  and  in management s opinion  competitive loan underwriting terms were too liberal to ensure high quality loan originations  and loan pricing was not sufficient to ensure adequate profitability over the expected loan durations 
the company s competitive posture during this period resulted in declining loan volumes 
a severe recession and weak economic conditions impacted loan volumes throughout and during and  net loan losses increased due to weak economic conditions and declines in the value of real estate collateral 
accordingly  management increased the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non covered loans outstanding has gradually declined from through the decline is generally due to the realization of losses in and which were inherent in the loan portfolio in earlier years  and a reduction in the company s exposure to higher risk non covered real estate construction loans 

table of contents the company s allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions 
these include conditions unique to individual borrowers  as well as overall credit loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming loans and classified loans  fdic loss sharing coverage relative to covered loan carrying amounts  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
a portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to impaired loans whose full collectibility is uncertain 
such allocations are determined by management based on loan by loan analyses 
a second allocation is based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified credit balances identified through an independent internal credit review process are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard loss rates 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the allowance to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  small loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends  grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent 
given currently weak economic conditions  management is applying further analysis to consumer loans 
current levels of automobile loan losses are compared to initial allowance allocations and  based on management judgment  additional allocations are applied  if needed  to estimate losses 
for residential real estate loans  management is comparing ultimate loss rates on foreclosed residential real estate properties and applying such loss rates to nonaccrual residential real estate loans 
based on this analysis  management exercises judgment in allocating additional allowance if deemed appropriate to estimate losses on residential real estate loans 
last  allocations are made to non criticized and non classified commercial loans based on historical loss rates and other statistical data 
the remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated 
the unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance 
it addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with management s analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio  which are related to the risks of the company s general lending activity 
included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have not yet been recognized in past loan charge off history external factors 
the external factors evaluated by the company include economic and business conditions  external competitive issues  and other factors 
also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the company s loan portfolio and credit administration internal factors 
the internal factors evaluated by the company include loan review system  adequacy of lending management and staff  loan policies and procedures  problem loan trends  concentrations of credit  and other factors 
by their nature  these risks are not readily allocable to any specific loan category in a statistically meaningful manner and are difficult to quantify with a specific number 
management assigns a range of estimated risk to the qualitative risk factors described above based on management s judgment as to the level of risk  and assigns a quantitative risk factor from the range of loss estimates to determine the appropriate level of the unallocated portion of the allowance 
management considers the million allowance for credit losses to be adequate as a reserve against non covered credit losses as of december  the following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses as of december for the years indicated allocation of the allowance for credit losses loans as loans as loans as loans as loans as percent percent percent percent percent allocation of total allocation of total allocation of total allocation of total allocation of total of the non of the non of the non of the non of the non at december  allowance covered allowance covered allowance covered allowance covered allowance covered dollars in thousands balance loans balance loans balance loans balance loans balance loans commercial real estate construction real estate residential consumer unallocated portion total the allocation to loan portfolio segments changed from december  to december  the decrease in allocation for commercial loans reflects management s evaluation of loss rates against commercial loan performance metrics 
the decrease in allocation to real estate construction loans reflects a decrease in criticized construction loans outstanding 
the elevated allocation for residential real estate loans is attributable to management s judgment regarding the appropriate allocation based on recent foreclosure losses and increased levels of nonaccrual mortgages 
the higher allocation for consumer loans was primarily due to management s judgment regarding the appropriate allocation based on current levels of auto loan chargeoffs 

table of contents the allocation to loan portfolio segments changed from december  to december  the decrease in allocation to commercial loans was primarily due to a reduction in allocations to agricultural and municipal loans based on re evaluation and measurement of risk attributes 
the decline in the allocation to real estate construction loans reflects a decrease in criticized real estate construction loans and the increase in allocation to consumer loans reflects delinquency trends 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses declined thousand from december  to december  the unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred  but not reflected in the allocated allowance

the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to smaller balance loans that are collectively evaluated for credit risk 
in assessing impairment  the company reviews all nonaccrual commercial and construction loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of million 
nonaccrual commercial and construction loans with outstanding principal balances less than million  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology

table of contents asset liability and market risk management asset liability management involves the evaluation  monitoring and management of interest rate risk  market risk  liquidity and funding 
the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is a significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk results from many factors 
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts 
short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts 
the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change 
in addition  interest rates may have an impact on loan demand  credit losses  and other sources of earnings such as account analysis fees on commercial deposit accounts and correspondent bank service charges 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing the net interest margin and net interest income 
at times  depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may adjust the company s interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
the company s asset and liability position was neutral at december   the simulation model employed by management measured similar amounts of increased interest income and interest expense in the most likely scenarios with rising interest rates 
management continues to monitor the interest rate environment as well as economic conditions and other factors it deems relevant in managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management assesses interest rate risk by comparing the company s most likely earnings plan with various earnings models using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes  the degree of change over time  the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve 
for example  using the current composition of the company s balance sheet and assuming no change in the federal funds rate and no change in the year constant maturity treasury bond yield during the same period  earnings are not estimated to change by a meaningful amount compared to the company s most likely net income plan for the twelve months ending december  conversely  using the current composition of the company s balance sheet and assuming an increase of bp in the federal funds rate and an increase of bp in the year constant maturity treasury bond yield during the same period  earnings are not estimated to change by a meaningful amount compared to the company s most likely net income plan for the twelve months ending december  simulation estimates depend on  and will change with  the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company s board of directors 
market risk equity markets equity price risk can affect the company 
as an example  any preferred or common stock holdings  as permitted by banking regulations  can fluctuate in value 
management regularly assesses the extent and duration of any declines in market value  the causes of such declines  the likelihood of a recovery in market value  and its intent to hold securities until a recovery in value occurs 
declines in value of preferred or common stock holdings that are deemed other than temporary could result in loss recognition in the company s income statement 
fluctuations in the company s common stock price can impact the company s financial results in several ways 
first  the company has regularly repurchased and retired its common stock  the market price paid to retire the company s common stock can affect the level of the company s shareholders equity  cash flows and shares outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share 
second  the company s common stock price impacts the number of dilutive equivalent shares used to compute diluted earnings per share 
third  fluctuations in the company s common stock price can motivate holders of options to purchase company common stock through the exercise of such options thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding 
finally  the amount of compensation expense associated with share based compensation fluctuates with changes in and the volatility of the company s common stock price

the remaining liquidity was used to reduce higher cost borrowed funds  primarily subordinated debt which decreased million and federal funds purchased which declined million 
the company held billion in total investment securities at december  under certain deposit  borrowing and other arrangements  the company must pledge investment securities as collateral 
at december   such collateral requirements totaled approximately billion

at december   million in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and mortgage backed securities mbss were held in the company s investment portfolios 
none of the cmos or mbss are backed by sub prime mortgages 
other than nominal amounts of fhlmc and fnma mbss purchased for community reinvestment act investment purposes  the company has not purchased a cmo or mbs since november the cmos and mbss have been experiencing stable principal paydowns of approximately million per month during the last three months 
in addition  at december   the company had customary lines for overnight borrowings from other financial institutions in excess of million  under which was outstanding 
additionally  the company has access to borrowing from the federal reserve 
the company s short term debt rating from fitch ratings is f the company s long term debt rating from fitch ratings is a with a stable outlook
