in addition  our representatives may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
forward looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact 
words such as anticipates  in the opinion  believes  intends  expects  may  will  should  could  plans  forecasts  estimates  predicts  projects  potential  continue  and similar expressions may be intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth below  and  in particular  those in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k included elsewhere herein 
we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or changes to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
we wish to caution readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
the fact that the economy generally  and the technology and storage segments specifically  have been in a state of uncertainty makes it difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future and makes it impossible to determine if markets will grow or shrink in the short term 
the recent economic downturn and the resulting economic uncertainty for our customers and the storage networking market as a whole has and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
furthermore  the effect of any actual or potential unsolicited offers to acquire us may have an adverse effect on our operations 
as a result of this uncertainty  we are unable to predict with any accuracy what future results might be 
other factors affecting these forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following slower than expected growth of the storage networking market or the failure of our original equipment manufacturer oem customers to successfully incorporate our products into their systems  our dependence on a limited number of customers and the effects of the loss of  or decrease or delays in orders by  any such customers  or the failure of such customers to make payments  the emergence of new or stronger competitors as a result of consolidation movements in the market  the timing and market acceptance of our or our oem customers new or enhanced products  the variability in the level of our backlog and the variable and seasonal procurement patterns of our customers  impairment charges  including but not limited to goodwill  intangible assets  and equity investments recorded under the cost method  changes in tax rates or legislation  the effects of acquisitions  the effects of terrorist activities  natural disasters and any resulting political or economic instability  the highly competitive nature of the markets for our products as well as pricing pressures that may result from such competitive conditions  the effect of rapid migration of customers towards newer  lower cost product platforms  possible transitions from board or box level to application specific computer chip solutions for selected applications  a shift in unit product mix from higher end to lower end or mezzanine card products  a decrease in the average unit selling prices or an increase in the manufactured cost of our products  delays in product development  our reliance on third party suppliers and subcontractors for components and assembly  any inadequacy of our intellectual property protection or the potential that third party claims of infringement and any related indemnity obligations could adversely affect our operations or financial condition  our ability to attract and retain key technical personnel  our ability to benefit from our research and development activities  our dependence on international sales and internationally produced products  changes in accounting standards  and the potential effects of global warming and any resulting regulatory changes on our business 
these and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements and are discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference

global initiatives as part of our global initiatives  we created an irish subsidiary to expand our international operations by providing local customer service and support to our customers outside of the united states in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  emulex granted an intellectual property license and entered into a research and development cost sharing agreement with its subsidiary in the isle of man 
the terms of the license require that the subsidiary make prepayments of expected royalties to a us subsidiary  the first of which was paid before the end of fiscal in the amount of approximately million  for expected royalties relating to fiscal through in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the subsidiary made the second prepayment of approximately million for expected royalties relating to fiscal through these global initiatives are expected to continue to reduce our effective tax rate 
our cash balances and investments are held in numerous locations throughout the world 
the cash and investments held outside of the us are expected to increase  primarily in our isle of man and ireland subsidiaries 
substantially all of the amounts held outside of the us will be available for repatriation at any time  but under current law  repatriated funds would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
business combination on august   subsequent to our fiscal  we acquired serverengines corporation serverengines for consideration including approximately million in cash  subject to reduction for serverengines debt outstanding at the close of the acquisition and other adjustments  and approximately million shares of our common stock  of which approximately million shares are issuable upon achievement of two post closing milestones 
the combination of emulex and serverengines technology would create a unique offering to deliver a foundation for converged networking solutions  including adapters  mezzanine cards and lan on motherboard lom solutions 
results of operations for emulex corporation and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data set forth in item selected consolidated financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

net revenues by major customers in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchase or market products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
if these indirect sales are purchases of customer specific models  we are able to track these sales 
however  if these indirect sales are purchases of our standard models  we are not able to distinguish them by oem customer

direct and indirect sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately and of total net revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
our net revenues from customers can be significantly impacted by changes to our customers business and their business models 
net revenues by sales channel net revenues by sales channel were as follows net revenues by sales channel percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands oem distribution other total net revenues the increase in oem net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues was mainly due to end users migrating from purchasing our products through the distribution channel toward purchasing our products through oem server manufacturers 
we believe that our net revenues are being generated primarily as a result of product certifications and qualifications with our oem customers  which take products directly and indirectly through distribution and contract manufacturers 
we view product certifications and qualifications as an important indicator of future revenue opportunities and growth for the company 
however  product certifications and qualifications do not necessarily ensure continued market acceptance of our products by our oem customers 
it is also very difficult to determine the future impact  if any  of product certifications and qualifications on our revenues 
net revenues by geographic territory our net revenues by geographic territory based on billed to location were as follows net revenues by geographic territory percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands asia pacific united states europe  middle east  and africa rest of the world total net revenues we believe the decrease in united states net revenues and increase in asia pacific net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to our oem customers migrating towards using contract manufacturers located internationally  predominantly in asia pacific 
however  as we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of net revenues less cost of sales 
our gross profit for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands gross profit percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease points change cost of sales includes the cost of producing  supporting  and managing our supply of quality finished products 
cost of sales also included approximately million of amortization of technology intangible assets for both fiscal years and approximately million and million of share based compensation expense were included in cost of sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin increased slightly during fiscal primarily due to the consumption of previously reserved excess inventories  a favorable mix of higher margin legacy esp products  and efficiencies resulting from higher manufacturing volume 
although gross margin increased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal  we anticipate gross margin will trend downward over time as faster growing  lower gross margin products become a larger portion of our business 
engineering and development

during fiscal  we implemented organizational changes and reduced engineering and development headcount to  incurring severance and related charges of approximately million 
during fiscal  the reduced headcount resulted in a decrease of approximately million in salary and related expenses compared to the same period in the prior year  offset by an increase in performance based compensation of approximately million 
towards the end of fiscal  engineering and development headcount increased to  primarily due to employees hired in connection with the purchase of a business from a privately held storage networking company 
the remaining change in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in new product development of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million  a decrease in software expenses of approximately million  and a decrease in information technology expenses of approximately million 
we will continue to invest in engineering and development activities and anticipate expenditures will increase in this area with the recent acquisition of serverengines

the decrease in headcount resulted in a decrease of approximately million in salary and related expenses compared to the same period in fiscal  offset by an increase in performance based compensation of approximately million 
the remaining change in general and administrative expenses was primarily due an increase of approximately million in costs related to the broadcom unsolicited takeover proposal and related litigation and an increase in acquisition related costs of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in facilities expenses of approximately million  a decrease in outside services of approximately million  and a decrease in information technology expenses of approximately million

our amortization of expense for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands amortization of other intangible assets percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease points change amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal compared to fiscal increased approximately million  or 
the increase was primarily due to amortization expense related to a patent licensing agreement entered into in the fiscal partially offset by a lower unamortized balance of intangibles at the beginning of the current fiscal year

our effective tax rate was a benefit of approximately for fiscal compared to a benefit of approximately for fiscal the decrease in income taxes for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a benefit of approximately million resulting from lower taxable income combined with a change in the geographic mix of taxable income between domestic and foreign jurisdictions  a tax benefit related to domestic production activities deductions for tax years through of approximately million  an increase in tax benefits related to share based compensation of approximately million  a tax benefit of approximately million related to the option exchange program  partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits related to lower federal research credits of approximately million and a decrease in tax benefits related to a release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of an expiration of statute of limitations of approximately million 
tax benefits from federal research credits were lower during fiscal compared to fiscal due to the expiration of the federal research credit on december  and the retroactive extension of the federal research credit in october as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of fiscal versus fiscal net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million  compared to approximately million in fiscal we believe the decrease in net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a global economic slowdown that has resulted in decreased spending in general  and in the technology sector specifically

our amortization of expense for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands amortization of other intangible assets percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease points change amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased approximately million  or

our nonoperating income  net for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands nonoperating income  net percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease points change our nonoperating income  net  for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased approximately million  or

our effective tax rate was a benefit of approximately for fiscal compared to an expense of approximately for fiscal the decrease in income taxes for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in income before taxes for fiscal compared to the prior year  an increase in tax benefits related to a release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of an expiration of statute of limitations of approximately million  an increase in tax credits related to qualifying research expenditures of approximately million  and a decrease in tax resulting from the incremental tax expense of approximately million for the prepayment of royalty made in fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  warranty  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets and other long lived assets  inventories  goodwill  income taxes  stock based compensation  and litigation costs 
changes in judgments and uncertainties could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectibility has been reasonably assured basic revenue recognition criteria 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels and have various distribution agreements with selected distributors and master value added resellers collectively  the distributors 
these distribution agreements may be terminated upon written notice by either party 
additionally  these distributors are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenue on our standard products sold to our distributors based on data received from the distributors and management s estimates to approximate the point that these products have been resold by the distributors 
oem specific models sold to our distributors are governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment for oem specific products shipped to the distributors when the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met 
additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and various other marketing programs 
we classify the costs of these incentive programs based on the benefit received  if applicable  as either a reduction of revenue  a cost of sale  or an operating expense 
our early adoption of the new guidance related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and certain revenue arrangements that include software elements during fiscal with retroactive application to the beginning of the fiscal year did not impact our revenue recognized during the year 
warranty 
we provide a warranty of between one and five years on our products 
we record a provision for estimated warranty related costs at the time of sale based on historical product return rates and management s estimates of expected future costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
we evaluate our ongoing warranty obligation on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues and management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management believes that collectibility of the amount is unlikely 
although we have not historically experienced significant losses on accounts receivable  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
intangible assets and other long lived assets 
intangible assets resulting from acquisitions or licensing agreements are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges  if any 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from five to seven years 
furthermore  we assess whether our long lived assets  including intangible assets and equity investment in a privately held company recorded under the cost method  should be tested for recoverability periodically and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we use a standard cost system to determine cost 
the standard costs are adjusted periodically to represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure that the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to reduce the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
management considers our business as a whole to be its reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually during the fourth fiscal quarter 
as of the date of the fiscal annual impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
as of the date of the fiscal annual impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value  therefore  we were not at risk of failing the first step of the two step test for potential impairment 
there may be additional goodwill to be recorded in connection with our recent acquisition of serverengines  although the purchase price allocation has not yet been determined 
we will continue to monitor for potential indicators of impairment 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method 
stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the fair value of each unvested stock award is determined based on the closing price of our common stock at grant date 
for stock options  the measurement of stock based compensation cost is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors such as expected term  stock price volatility  dividend rate  risk free interest rate  and award forfeiture rate 
the input factors used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stock based compensation costs and the actual forfeitures  which become known over time  we may change the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein for additional information and related disclosures 
litigation costs 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
legal and other litigation related costs are recognized as the services are provided 
we record insurance recoveries for litigation costs for which both conditions are met i the recovery is probable and ii collectability is reasonably assured 
the insurance recoveries recorded are only to the extent the litigation costs have been incurred and recognized in the financial statements  however  it is reasonably possible that the actual recovery may be significantly different from our estimates 
there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot provide assurance that any actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation or substantial settlement charges 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short terms to maturity 
as of june   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value

we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
we did not hold any auction rate securities or direct investments in mortgage backed securities as of june  the fair market value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future
