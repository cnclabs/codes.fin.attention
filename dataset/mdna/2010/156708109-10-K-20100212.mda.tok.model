table of contents our most significant products are our wakefulness products  provigil modafinil tablets 
c iv 
and nuvigil armodafinil tablets 
c iv  which comprised of our total consolidated net sales for the year ended december   of which was in the us market 
for the year ended december   combined consolidated net sales of provigil and nuvigil increased over the year ended december  in june  we secured final us food and drug administration the fda approval of the nuvigil indication for the treatment of excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy  obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome osa hs and shift work sleep disorder swsd 
we launched nuvigil on june  in march  we announced positive results from a phase ii clinical trial of nuvigil as adjunctive therapy for treating major depressive disorder in adults with bipolar i disorder and our plan to advance to phase iii trials for this indication 
in april  we announced positive results from a phase iii clinical trial of nuvigil as a treatment for excessive sleepiness associated with jet lag disorder and filed a supplemental new drug application an snda for this indication with the fda in june we expect a response from the fda by march  in may  we announced positive results from a phase iv study of nuvigil in obstructive sleep apnea and co morbid major depressive disorder requiring ongoing antidepressant therapy 
on a combined basis  our two next most significant products are fentora fentanyl buccal tablet 
c ii 
and actiq oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate 
c ii 
including our generic version of actiq generic otfc 
together  these products comprise of our total consolidated net sales for the year ended december   of which was in the us market 
in october  we launched fentora in the united states 
fentora is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer who are already receiving and are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain 
in april  we received marketing authorization from the european commission for effentora for the same indication as fentora and launched the product in certain european countries in january we have focused our clinical strategy for fentora on studying the product in opioid tolerant patients with breakthrough pain associated with chronic pain conditions  such as neuropathic pain and back pain 
in november  we submitted an snda to the fda seeking approval to market fentora for the management of breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant patients with chronic pain conditions 
in early april  we submitted a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy the rems program with respect to fentora 
subject to the timing and nature of further discussions with the fda  we expect to receive a response from the fda regarding the fentora rems program by the middle of with respect to actiq  its sales have been meaningfully eroded by the launch of fentora and by generic otfc products sold since june by barr laboratories  inc and by us through our sales agent  watson pharmaceuticals  inc we expect this erosion will continue 
in september  our obligation to supply barr with generic otfc ended pursuant to the terms of a license and supply agreement we entered into with barr in july in october  we understand that the fda approved andas by barr and by covidien to market and sell generic otfc 
we submitted our rems program for actiq and generic otfc in early april we expect to receive a response from the fda by the middle of in march  the fda granted an orphan drug approval for treanda bendamustine hydrochloride for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll and  in april  the product was launched 
in october  we received fda approval of treanda for treatment of patients with indolent b cell non hodgkin s lymphoma nhl who have progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab containing regimen 
treanda comprised of our total consolidated net sales for the year ended december   all of which were in the us market 
while not a currently approved indication by the fda  treanda was recently listed in the nccn clinical practice guidelines as a front line treatment for nhl 
we believe the guidelines listing was the result of an independent phase iii clinical study conducted by the german study group for indolent lymphomas stil group in giessen  germany 
the stil group s study results announced in december indicated better tolerability and more than a month 
table of contents improvement in median progression free survival in patients treated with treanda in combination with rituximab versus cyclophosphamide  doxorubicin  vincristine  and prednisolone commonly known as chop in combination with rituximab for the first line treatment of patients with advanced follicular  indolent  and mantle cell lymphomas  each of which is not currently an fda approved indication 
in august  we acquired exclusive north american rights to amrix cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended release capsules from e 
claiborne robins company  inc  a privately held company d b a ecr pharmaceuticals ecr 
two dosage strengths of amrix mg and mg were approved in february by the fda for short term use as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute  painful musculoskeletal conditions 
we made the product available in the united states in october and commenced a full us launch in november in june  the us patent and trademark office the pto issued a pharmaceutical formulation patent for amrix  which expires in february in august  we established a million  three year revolving credit facility the credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank  na and certain other lenders 
the credit facility is available for letters of credit  working capital and general corporate purposes and is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants  including but not limited to covenants related to total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement  senior debt to consolidated ebitda  interest expense coverage and limitations on capital expenditures  asset sales  mergers and acquisitions  indebtedness  liens  and transactions with affiliates 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  we have not drawn any amounts under the credit facility 
as a biopharmaceutical company  our future success is highly dependent on obtaining and maintaining patent protection or regulatory exclusivity for our products and technology 
we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement  of our patents 
the loss of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity on any of our existing products  whether by third party challenge  invalidation  circumvention  license or expiration  could materially impact our results of operations 
in late and early  we entered into provigil patent settlement agreements with certain generic pharmaceutical companies 
as part of these separate settlements  we agreed to grant to each of these parties a non exclusive royalty bearing license to market and sell a generic version of provigil in the united states  effective in april  subject to applicable regulatory considerations 
under the agreements  the licenses could become effective prior to april only if a generic version of provigil is sold in the united states prior to this date 
we filed each of the settlements with both the us federal trade commission the ftc and the antitrust division of the us department of justice the doj as required by the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare modernization act 
the ftc conducted an investigation of each of the provigil settlements and  in february  filed suit against us challenging the validity of the settlements and related agreements 
the complaint alleges a violation of section a of the federal trade commission act and seeks to permanently enjoin us from maintaining or enforcing these agreements and from engaging in similar conduct in the future 
we believe the ftc complaint is without merit and we have filed a motion to dismiss the case 
while we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and the propriety of the settlement agreements  these efforts will be both expensive and time consuming and  ultimately  due to the nature of litigation  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
we also received rights to certain modafinil related intellectual property developed by each party and in exchange for these rights  we agreed to make payments to barr  mylan  ranbaxy and teva collectively totaling up to million  consisting of upfront payments  milestones and royalties on net sales of our modafinil products 
in order to maintain an adequate supply of the active drug substance modafinil  we entered into agreements with three modafinil suppliers whereby we have 
table of contents agreed to purchase minimum amounts of modafinil through  with remaining aggregate purchase commitments totaling million as of december  based on our current assessment  we have recorded a reserve of million for purchase commitments for modafinil raw materials not expected to be utilized 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
in september  as part of our settlement with the us government regarding their investigation of our promotional practices with respect to actiq  gabitril and provigil  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement the cia with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services 
the cia provides criteria for establishing and maintaining compliance with federal laws governing the marketing and promotion of our products 
we are also subject to periodic reporting and certification requirements attesting that the provisions of the cia are being implemented and followed 
we are or may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including  among others  matters alleging employment discrimination  product liability  patent or other intellectual property rights infringement  patent invalidity or breach of commercial contract 
in particular  as a biopharmaceutical company  our future success is highly dependent on obtaining and maintaining patent protection or regulatory exclusivity for our products and technology 
in that regard  we are currently engaged in lawsuits with respect to generic company challenges to the validity and or enforceability of our patents covering amrix  fentora and nuvigil 
we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement  of our patents 
the loss of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity on any of our existing products  whether by third party challenge  invalidation  circumvention  license or expiration  could materially impact our results of operations 
for more information regarding the legal proceedings described in this overview and others  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
we have significant levels of indebtedness outstanding  nearly all of which consists of convertible notes 
under the terms of the indentures governing nearly all of our notes  we are obligated to repay in cash the aggregate principal balance of any such notes presented for conversion 
for a more complete description of these notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we do not have available cash  cash equivalents and investments sufficient to repay all of the convertible notes  if presented 
in addition  there are no restrictions on our use of this cash  and the cash available to repay indebtedness may decline over time 
as of december  the fair value of both the convertible senior subordinated notes due june  the notes and zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  the zero coupon notes is greater than the value of the shares into which such notes are convertible 
we believe that the share price of our common stock would have to significantly increase over the market price as of the filing date of this report before the fair value of the convertible notes would be less than the value of the common stock shares underlying the notes 
as such  we believe it is highly unlikely that holders of the notes or zero coupon notes will present significant amounts of such notes for conversion under the current terms 
in the unlikely event that a significant conversion did occur  we believe that we have the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand  accessing our credit facility  raising money in the capital markets or selling our note hedge instruments for cash 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities

bdc stockholders could also receive additional future payments related to regulatory and sales milestones 
bdc is currently conducting a phase ii placebo controlled proof of concept study with the tumor necrosis factor tnf inhibitor  etanercept  epidurally administered to a minimum of patients with sciatica 
sciatica is a neuropathic inflammatory pain condition that occurs when the sciatic nerve is compressed  injured or irritated 
bdc has secured an intellectual property estate around use of tnf inhibitors for sciatic pain in patients with intervertebral disk herniation  as well as other spinal disorders 
we may exercise our option at any time from the closing date of the option agreement until the date that is days after receipt of one month patient response data from bdc s phase ii study

decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period and thus may not necessarily correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health incorporated 
we have distribution service agreements with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
various factors can impact the decisions made by wholesalers and retailers regarding the levels of inventory they hold  including  among other factors  their assessment of anticipated demand for products  timing of sales made by them  their review of historical product usage trends  and their purchasing patterns 
as of december   we received information from substantially all of our us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our us branded products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately two to three weeks supply of our us branded products at our current sales levels 
as of our most recent retail inventory survey in june  our generic otfc inventory held at wholesalers and retailers is approximately three months 
we do not expect that potential future fluctuations in inventory levels of generic otfc held by retailers will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents for the twelve months ended december   in addition to the factors addressed below  net sales were also impacted by changes in the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales as described further below and by changes in the relative levels of the number of units of inventory held at wholesalers and retailers 
declines in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar caused an decrease in european net sales 
the other key factors that contributed to the increase in net sales  period to period  are summarized by product as indicated below 
in cns  net sales increased percent 
net sales of nuvigil  launched in june  contributed to an increase in cns sales in the us  while provigil net sales in the us increased by due to price increases in and  partially offset by a decline in unit sales due to the introduction of nuvigil and the transition of our marketing support from provigil to nuvigil 
european net sales of provigil remained constant  as the unfavorable effect of exchange rates offset an increase in unit sales attributable to increased promotional efforts 
net sales of gabitril  a non promoted product  decreased in the us and in europe 
in pain  net sales decreased percent 
net sales of our pain products have been negatively impacted by an overall decline in the rapid onset opioid market 
gross sales of fentora increased  as domestic price increases in and and the introduction of fentora in europe during offset decreased volume 
net sales of fentora decreased due to an increase in returns percentages 
net sales of actiq in the us decreased by due to loss of market share to generic competition  partially offset by price increases during net sales of our own generic otfc and shipments of our generic otfc to barr decreased 
in september  our obligation to supply barr with generic otfc ended pursuant to the terms of a license and supply agreement we entered into with barr in july net sales of actiq in europe increased  as the increase in unit sales exceeded the unfavorable effect of exchange rate changes 
the decreases in net sales of fentora  actiq and generic otfc were largely offset by a increase in amrix net sales 
amrix  launched in late  gained market share over prior year levels and benefited from average domestic price increases of period to period 
in oncology  net sales increased percent 
this increase was attributable to the growth of treanda  which launched in april net sales of our european oncology products increased as increase in unit sales exceeded the unfavorable effect of exchange rate changes 
throughout  we expect oncology net sales to exceed prior year amounts due to the increased acceptance of treanda  resulting in increased sales levels 
other net sales  which consist primarily of net sales of other products and certain third party products  decreased percent  primarily due to the november termination of our agreement with alkermes  inc and the unfavorable effect of exchange rate changes on our other products sold in europe 
other revenues the increase of from period to period is primarily due to revenues and license royalties earned by arana  offset by a decrease in revenues from our collaborators including royalties  milestone payments and fees

wholesaler discounts increased period over period because fewer discounts were required for early as a result of price increases 
returns increased as a result of increased returns rates related to provigil and estimated returns of nuvigil as a result of the launch of nuvigil 
coupons increased as a result of the effect of nuvigil coupon programs  partially offset by the termination of the provigil coupon program in the third quarter of medicaid discounts increased slightly for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  due to price increases  partially offset by the lower medicaid utilization of our cns and pain products 
managed care and governmental contracts decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  due to decreases in rebates for certain managed care and governmental programs  particularly with respect to sales of our pain products 
in the future  we expect product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales to trend upward due to the impact of potential future price increases on medicaid discounts and potential increases related to medicaid  medicare part d  managed care and governmental contracts sales

in  royalties paid to teva decreased by million compared to  as we fully satisfied royalty contractual commitments during july for the year ended december  and  we recognized million and million of amortization expense included in cost of sales  respectively 
amortization expense decreased by million due to the increase in estimated useful life for amrix from to years and by million due to the elimination of amortization for vivitrol  partially offset by increases in amortization for treanda and arana

decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period and thus may not necessarily correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health incorporated 
we have distribution service agreements with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
as of december   we received information from substantially all of our us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our us branded products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately two to three weeks supply of our us branded products at our current sales levels 
at december   we believe that inventory held at wholesalers and retailers of our generic otfc product  launched in october  is approximately five months supply at our current sales levels 
for the year ended december   net sales were impacted by changes in the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales as described further below and by changes in the relative levels of the number of units of inventory held at wholesalers and retailers

table of contents  total net sales increased over the prior year 
the other key factors that contributed to the changes in sales are summarized by product as follows in cns  net sales of provigil increased percent 
net sales of provigil in the us increased as a result of average domestic price increases of from period to period 
us prescriptions for provigil decreased by  according to ims health 
european net sales increased due to the favorable effect of exchange rate changes and stronger sales in substantially all territories 
in pain  net sales decreased percent 
net sales of actiq in the us were impacted by increases in domestic prices of from period to period  offset by a decrease in us prescriptions  according to ims health  resulting from the continued erosion of sales due to generic competition to actiq 
net sales of actiq also decreased due to an increase in returns during the second half of net sales of generic otfc decreased due to decreases in prices and to a decrease in prescriptions according to ims health

wholesaler discounts decreased million period over period because cumulative price increases in produced wholesaler credits that partially offset the wholesaler discounts that would have otherwise been recorded for returns increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of higher actiq returns in the second half of and higher fentora returns in the fourth quarter of between march and july of  we increased actiq manufacturing levels to ensure sufficient supply as we switched manufacturing to fentora in anticipation of its launch and prepared for the transition of actiq production to a new facility that opened in august the expiration of this product in the second half of has resulted in both an increased amount of returns and a higher level of returns experience for this period 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced our first returns for fentora  which was launched in october as a result  we have increased our returns percentages as it relates to current actiq and fentora sales to more closely match this recent experience 
in  returns were impacted by a decrease in historical returns experience for our cns products and by our analysis of retail pipeline data 
coupons decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of the decrease in coupons redemption activity for fentora 
medicaid discounts increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to price increases  offset by the lower medicaid utilization of our cns and pain products 
managed care and governmental contracts increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to new managed care contracts related to provigil as well as additional utilization and rebates for certain managed care and governmental programs  particularly with respect to sales of provigil and our generic otfc product 
in addition  we recognized a reserve of million as of december  for amounts payable to the us department of defense dod under the new tricare program effective january  in the future  we expect product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales to slightly decrease due to a stabilization of our returns experience for our pain products and change in our sales mix to products with lower utilizations in certain managed care and governmental programs

other commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts payments due by period contractual obligations total and and and thereafter debt obligations convertible notes purchase obligations capital lease obligations interest payments on debt operating leases pension obligations total contractual obligations this value excludes the equity component of our convertible notes attributable to debt discount 
the debt discount values associated with the convertible notes at december  total as of december   our notes are convertible because the closing price of our common stock on that date was higher than the restricted conversion prices of these notes and our zero coupon notes are convertible based on maturity date 
as a result  our notes and our zero coupon notes have been classified as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and are therefore included under the column in the table above 
for a discussion of our obligations under our convertible notes  see outlook indebtedness below 

table of contents in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs primarily in the area of research and development agreements 
payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  we have not recorded a liability on our balance sheet for any such contingencies 
as of december   the potential milestone  option exercise payments and other contingency payments due under current contractual agreements are billion 
the table above excludes i our non current liability for net unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled million as of december   since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities and ii contractual obligations of our variable interest entities for intellectual property rights  equipment financing  construction financing and lease obligations as our variable interest entities creditors have no recourse to the general credit of cephalon 
outlook we expect to use our cash  cash equivalents  credit facility and investments for working capital and general corporate purposes  the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights  technologies  property  plant and equipment  the payment of contractual obligations  including scheduled interest payments on our convertible notes and regulatory or sales milestones that may become due  and or the purchase  redemption or retirement of our convertible notes 
we expect that net sales of our currently marketed products should allow us to continue to generate positive operating cash flow in at this time  however  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on our anticipated rate of sales growth in and beyond  such as the degree of market acceptance  patent protection and exclusivity of our products  the impact of competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop  receive approval for and successfully launch our product candidates and new indications for existing products 
based on our current level of operations  projected sales of our existing products  proceeds from our may financings  and estimated sales from our product candidates  if approved  combined with other revenues and interest income  we also believe that we will be able to service our existing debt and meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the near term 
we do not expect any material changes in our capital expenditure spending during however  we cannot be sure that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that we will continue to generate significant positive cash flow from operations 
we may need to obtain additional funding for future significant strategic transactions  to repay our outstanding indebtedness  particularly if such indebtedness is presented for conversion by holders see indebtedness below  or for our future operational needs  and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to issue stock or raise substantial additional funds to complete future transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs or closure costs 
marketed products and product candidates sales growth of our wakefulness products depends  in part  on the continued effectiveness of the various settlement agreements we entered into in late and early  as well as our maintenance of protection in the united states and abroad of the modafinil particle size patent through its 
table of contents expiration beginning in and our nuvigil polymorph patent through its expiration beginning in see note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
during  we experienced a decline in prescriptions of provigil 
growth of our wakefulness product sales in the future may depend in part on our ability to build upon the june launch of nuvigil in the us and on the strength of the patents covering the product  particularly in light of the andas filed by actavis  mylan  sandoz  teva and watson 
our future growth depends in large part on our ability to achieve continued sales growth with amrix and treanda  which we launched in october and april  respectively 
growth of amrix sales will depend in part on the strength of the patent covering the product  particularly in light of the andas filed by barr  mylan  impax and anchen 
our future growth also depends  in part  on our ability to successfully market fentora within its current indication and to secure fda approval of a new broader label indication for the product outside of breakthrough cancer pain 
in november  we submitted an snda to the fda seeking approval to market fentora for the management of breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant patients with chronic pain conditions 
in early april  we submitted a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy the rems program with respect to fentora 
subject to the timing and nature of further discussions with the fda  we expect to receive a response from the fda regarding the fentora rems program by the middle of for more information regarding our fentora rems program  please see part i  item pain fentora of this annual report on form k 
clinical studies over the past few years  we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels 
in  we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures 
we also expect to continue or begin a number of significant clinical programs including clinical studies evaluating lupuzor for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus  clinical programs at arana with respect to certain oncology and inflammatory disorders  and clinical programs with nuvigil focused on adjunctive treatment to atypical anti psychotics in schizophrenia patients  adjunctive treatment for bi polar depression and excessive sleepiness associated with traumatic brain injury 
manufacturing  selling and marketing efforts in  we expect to continue to incur significant expenditures associated with manufacturing  selling and marketing our products 
we expect to continue in a capital expenditure project related to the transfer of manufacturing activities from our facility in eden prairie  minnesota to our facility in salt lake city  utah  we expect this phased transfer to be completed in over the past few years  we have been developing a manufacturing process for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in nuvigil that is more cost effective than our prior process of separating modafinil into armodafinil 
as a result of our plan to manufacture armodafinil in the future using this new process coupled with the launch of nuvigil on june   we assessed the potential impact of these items on certain of our existing agreements to purchase modafinil 
under these contracts  we have agreed to purchase minimum amounts of modafinil through  with aggregate future purchase commitments totaling million as of december  based on our current assessment  we have recorded a reserve of million for purchase commitments for modafinil raw materials not expected to be utilized 
we have also initiated a search for a potential acquiror of our manufacturing facility in mitry mory  france where we produce modafinil

we believe that the share price of our common stock would have to significantly increase over the market price as of the filing date of this report before the fair value of the convertible notes would be less than the value of the common stock shares underlying the notes and  as such  we believe it is highly unlikely that holders of the notes or the zero coupon notes will present significant amounts of such notes for conversion under the current terms 
in the unlikely event that a significant conversion did occur  we believe that we have the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand  accessing our credit facility  raising money in the capital markets or selling our note hedge instruments for cash 
the annual interest payments on our notes are million  payable semi annually on june and december the annual interest payments on our notes are million  payable semi annually on may and november in the future  we may agree to exchanges of the notes for shares of our common stock or debt  or may determine to use a portion of our existing cash on hand to purchase or retire all or a portion of the outstanding convertible notes 
our notes  notes and zero coupon notes each are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method 
under the treasury stock method  we must calculate the number of shares issuable under the terms of these notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the period  and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period 
at the time we sold our notes  and zero coupon notes we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the notes by increasing the effective conversion price for these notes  from our perspective  to  and  respectively 
however  from an accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap perspective  since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is always anti dilutive we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 
under the treasury stock method  changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation 
the following table provides examples of how changes in our stock price will require the inclusion of additional shares in the denominator of the fully diluted earnings per share calculation total treasury stock method incremental shares 
the table also reflects the impact on the number

acquisition strategy as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to issue stock or raise substantial additional funds to complete future transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
other we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results based primarily on the level and timing of cost of product sales  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials  regulatory approvals and product launches  marketing and other expenses  manufacturing or supply disruptions  unanticipated conversions of our convertible notes  and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in thousands management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we develop and periodically change these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
management considers the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition in the united states  we sell our proprietary products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which account for of our total consolidated gross sales for the year ended december  decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us may have materially affected the level of our sales in any particular period and thus our sales may not correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health 
we have distribution service agreements with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
product sales are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product to the customer 
in the united states  we sell all commercial products fob destination 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product pass to the customer at the point that the product is received by the customer 
in europe  product sales are recognized predominantly upon customer receipt of the product  except in certain contractual arrangements where different terms may be specified 
payments under co promotional or managed services agreements are recognized over the period when the products are sold or the promotional activities are performed 
the portion of the payments that represent reimbursement of our expenses is recognized as an offset to those expenses in our results of operations 
we recognize revenue on new product launches when sales returns can be reasonably estimated and all other revenue recognition requirements have been met 
when determining if returns can be estimated  we consider actual returns of similar products as well as sales returns with similar customers 
in cases in which a new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where we have no history of experience with products in a similar therapeutic category such that we can not estimate expected returns of the new product  we defer recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until we have developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns 
in developing estimates for sales returns  we consider inventory levels in the distribution channel  shelf life of the product and expected demand based on market data and prescriptions 

table of contents as of december   we received information from substantially all of our us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our us branded products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately two to three weeks supply of our us branded products at our current sales levels 
as of our most recent retail inventory survey in june  our generic otfc inventory held at wholesalers and retailers is approximately three months 
we do not expect that potential future fluctuations in inventory levels of generic otfc held by retailers will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
sales of our generic otfc product could be subject to retroactive price reductions for units that remain in the pipeline if the price of generic otfc is reduced  including as a result of another generic entrant into the market  and as a result any estimated impact of such adjustments is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
this estimate of both the potential timing of a generic entrant and the amount of the price reduction is highly subjective 
in october  we understand that the fda approved andas by barr and by covidien to market and sell generic otfc 
as a result  we have accrued a million shelf stock adjustment as of december  product sales allowances we record product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances prompt payment discounts  wholesaler discounts  returns  coupons  medicaid discounts and managed care and governmental contracts 
calculating each of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires us to use information from external sources 
in certain of the product sales allowance categories  we have calculated the impact of changes in our estimates  which we believe represent reasonably likely changes to these estimates based on historical data adjusted for certain unusual items such as changes in government contract rules 
prompt payment discounts we offer our us wholesaler customers a prompt pay cash discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first thirty five days after the date of the invoice 
prompt pay discount calculations are based on the gross amount of each invoice 
we account for these discounts by reducing sales by the discount amount when product is sold  and apply earned cash discounts at the time of payment 
since we began selling our products commercially in  our customers have routinely taken advantage of this discount 
based on common industry practices and our customers overall payment performance  we accrue for cash discounts on all us sales recorded during the period 
we adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience as necessary and  as a result  the actual amount recognized in any period may be slightly different from our accrual amount 
wholesaler discounts we have distribution service agreements with a number of our wholesaler customers that provide our wholesalers with the opportunity to earn up to in additional discounts in exchange for the performance of certain services 
we have therefore recorded a provision equal to of us gross sales for the twelve months ended december   less inventory appreciation adjustments for price increases 
in addition  at our discretion  we may provide additional discounts to wholesalers such as the additional discount offered to wholesalers on initial stocking orders 
actual discounts provided could therefore exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected discounts 
if these discounts were to increase by of gross sales from our proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
returns customers can return short dated or expired product that meets the guidelines set forth in our return goods policy 
product shelf life from the date of manufacture for nuvigil is three years  provigil is three to four years  depending on packaging  amrix is four years  gabitril is two to three years  depending on packaging  and actiq and fentora are each two years 
returns are accepted from wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
wholesaler customers can return short dated product with six months or less shelf life remaining and expired product within twelve months following the expiration date 
retail pharmacies are not permitted to return short dated product but can return full or partial quantities of expired product only within twelve months following the expiration date 
we 
table of contents base our estimates of product returns for each of our products on the percentage of returns that we have experienced historically 
notwithstanding this  we may adjust our estimate of product returns if we are aware of other factors that we believe could meaningfully impact our expected return percentages 
these factors could include  among others  our estimates of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  known sales trends and existing or anticipated competitive market forces such as product entrants and or pricing changes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for returns at a weighted average rate of of gross sales  which is an increase over our actual historical return percentages 
returns percentages increased for provigil in anticipation of the launch of nuvigil 
nuvigil returns percentages have been estimated based on historical provigil experience 
between march and july of  we increased actiq manufacturing levels to ensure sufficient supply as we switched manufacturing to fentora in anticipation of its launch and prepared for the transition of actiq production to a new facility that opened in august the expiration of actiq in the second half of and the expiration of initial launch quantities of fentora in late and early have resulted in both an increased amount of returns and a higher level of returns experience for and in the future  actual returns could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns activity because of several factors  including  among other things  wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and or competition 
if the returns provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
based on fourth quarter net sales  we believe a reasonable estimate of our maximum exposure for potential returns related to product in our total supply pipeline as of december  is million 
coupons we offer patients the opportunity to obtain free samples of our products through a program whereby physicians provide coupons to qualified patients for redemption at retail pharmacies 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for the cost of these products through a third party administrator 
we recognize the estimated cost of this reimbursement as a reduction of gross sales when product is sold 
in addition  we maintain an accrual for unused coupons based on inventory in the distribution channel and historical coupon usage rates and adjust this accrual whenever changes in such coupon usage rates occur 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for coupons at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual coupon usage could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future coupon activity 
if the coupons provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
medicaid discounts we record accruals for rebates to be provided through governmental rebate programs  such as the medicaid drug rebate program  as a reduction of sales when product is sold 
these reductions are based on historical rebate amounts and trends of sales eligible for these governmental programs for a period  as well as any expected changes to the trends of our total product sales 
in addition  we estimate the expected unit rebate amounts to be used and adjust our rebate accruals based on the expected changes in rebate pricing 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for medicaid discounts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual medicaid discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future medicaid patient activity or unit rebate amounts 
if the 
table of contents medicaid discounts provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
managed care and governmental contracts we have entered into agreements with certain managed care customers whereby we provide agreed upon discounts to such entities based on market share 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount rates and expected levels of market share of these managed care customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
discounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
we have entered into agreements with certain governmental customers other than medicaid whereby we provide legislatively mandated discounts and rebates to such entities 
we record accruals for these discounts and rebates as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount amounts and expected levels of performance of these governmental customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical sales amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
generally  discounts are granted to governmental customers by our wholesalers at time of purchase 
in other cases  rebates are paid directly to governmental customers based on reported levels of patient usage 
wholesalers charge these discounts and rebates back to us generally within one to three months 
we record accruals for our estimate of unprocessed chargebacks related to sales made during the period based on an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s sales  plus an accrual based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for managed care and governmental contracts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual chargebacks and rebates could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future participation in these programs 
if the chargebacks and rebates provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 

table of contents the following table summarizes activity in each of the above categories for the years ended december  and prompt payment discounts wholesaler discounts returns coupons medicaid discounts managed care governmental contracts total balance at december  provision current period prior periods total actual current period prior periods total balance at december  provision current period prior periods total actual current period prior periods total balance at december  given our return goods policy  we assume that all returns in a current year relate to prior period sales 
inventories effective october   we changed our method of accounting for inventories previously valued using the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method and adjusted our results for all of the periods presented 
as a result of this change  all inventories are now valued using the fifo method 
our inventories include the cost of raw materials  labor  overhead and shipping and handling costs 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in our opinion  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  we establish a reserve against the inventories carrying value 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements for forecasted product demand and the expiration dates of inventories 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated decreases in demand could have a material impact on the carrying value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
to date  inventory adjustments have not been material 
we expense pre approval inventory unless we believe it is probable that the inventory will be saleable 
we have capitalized inventory costs associated with marketed products and certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
with respect to capitalization of unapproved product 
table of contents candidates  we seek to produce inventory in preparation for the launch of the product and in amounts sufficient to support forecasted initial market demand 
typically  capitalization of this inventory does not begin until the product candidate is considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval 
this may occur when either the product candidate is in phase iii clinical trials or when it is a new formulation or dosage strength of a presently approved product for which we believe there is a high probability of receiving fda approval 
if we are aware of any specific risks or contingencies that are likely to impact the expected regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety  efficacy  manufacturing  marketing or labeling of the product candidate  we would not capitalize the related inventory 
when manufacturing and capitalizing inventory costs of product candidates and at each subsequent balance sheet date  we consider both the expiration dates of the inventory and anticipated future sales once approved 
since expiration dates are impacted by the stage of completion  we seek to avoid product expiration issues by managing the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory relative to anticipated market demand following launch 
once we have determined to capitalize inventory for a product candidate that is not yet approved  we will monitor  on a quarterly basis  the status of this candidate within the regulatory approval process 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in our judgment of future commercial use and net realizable value  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in the timeline for commercialization or other potential factors 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate all inventory  including inventory capitalized for which regulatory approval has not yet been obtained  to determine if any lower of cost or market adjustment is required 
as it relates to pre approval inventory  we consider several factors including expected timing of fda approval  projected sales volume and estimated selling price 
projected sales volume is based on several factors including market research  sales of similar products and competition in the market 
estimated sales price is based on the price of existing products sold for the same indications and expected market demand 
in june  we secured final fda approval of nuvigil 
prior to the commercial launch of nuvigil  we included net nuvigil inventory balances in other assets 
we launched nuvigil commercially on june  and reclassified our nuvigil inventory balances to current inventory at that time 
we have committed to make future minimum payments to third parties for certain raw material inventories 
over the past few years  we have been developing a manufacturing process for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in nuvigil that is more cost effective than our prior process of separating modafinil into armodafinil 
as a result of our plan to manufacture armodafinil in the future using this new process coupled with the launch of nuvigil on june   we assessed the potential impact of these items on certain of our existing agreements to purchase modafinil 
under these contracts  we have agreed to purchase minimum amounts of modafinil through  with aggregate future purchase commitments totaling million as of december  during the third quarter of  we recorded a reserve of million for purchase commitments for modafinil raw materials not expected to be utilized as a charge to cost of sales 
we reassessed our future modafinil needs during the second quarter of  in association with the accelerated launch of nuvigil  and increased the reserve by million  to million 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an agreement with one of our modafinil suppliers  paying million in exchange for a million reduction in our existing purchase commitments with this supplier  which resulted in a million gain recorded in cost of sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we reassessed our future modafinil needs as well as our commitments and increased the reserve by million 
as of december   our remaining reserve balance for 
table of contents excess purchase commitments is million

valuation of property and equipment  acquired intangible assets and goodwill our property and equipment have been recorded at cost and are being depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if an impairment indicator exists  we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment by applying a fair value based test on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value to do this  in the case of goodwill  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets 
in the case of intangibles and other long lived assets  we compare the estimated cash flows of the related asset group and compare it to the book value of the asset group 
calculating fair value as well as future cash flows requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable and reflective of common practice 
notwithstanding this  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment 
we have acquired intangible assets that consist of developed product technology and core technologies associated with intellectual property and rights thereon  as well as goodwill 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models 
these models require the use of significant estimates and judgments made by management and  for significant items  we typically consider  in part  the reports of third party valuation specialists 
assumptions used in valuing the intangibles include determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the deferred assets and liabilities included within the consolidated results from the activities of variable interest entities are not realizable benefits and or liabilities to cephalon 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information 
we provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our estimated annual combined federal  state and foreign statutory effective rates 
subsequent adjustments to our estimates of our ability to recover the deferred tax assets or other changes in circumstances or estimates could cause our provision for income taxes to vary from period to period  as it has for the current year ended december  at december   we have a valuation allowance of million  against a gross deferred tax asset balance of million 
this valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets which include state and foreign net operating losses  and state tax credits where we have concluded at 
table of contents this time that it is not more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
we will continue to review and analyze the likelihood of realizing tax benefits related to deferred tax assets as there is more certainty surrounding our future levels of profitability related to specific company operations and the related taxing jurisdictions 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits includes estimates and judgments by management and inherently includes subjectivity 
changes in estimates may create volatility in our effective tax rate in future periods due to settlements with various tax authorities either favorable or unfavorable  the expiration of the statute of limitations on some tax positions and obtaining new information about particular tax positions that may cause management to change its estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued revised accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets  which removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and establishes specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale 
the new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued revised accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities vie  which replaces the previous quantitative based risk and rewards calculation for determining the primary beneficiary of a vie with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits 
the new guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
it is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance but it could change our assessment of which entities are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued revised accounting guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendment requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method and provides for expanded disclosures related to such arrangements 
it is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our operations in european and australian subsidiaries that have transactions  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting purposes  as well as transactions  assets and liabilities of our domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies 
currently  we do not have any foreign exchange contracts that hedge these foreign currency exchange risks 
for the years ended december  and  an average weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our non us subsidiaries operate would have resulted in an increase of million and million  respectively  in reported total revenues and a corresponding increase in reported expenses 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not assume any changes in the level of operations of our foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates is not significant as all of our investments are cash and cash equivalents
