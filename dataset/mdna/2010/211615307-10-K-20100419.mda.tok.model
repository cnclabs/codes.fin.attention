item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations references to a note are to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report company overview as discussed in item business  the company operates primarily in two industry groups  hvac and construction products 
within each of these two industry groups  the company has identified two reportable segments the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment in the hvac industry group and the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment and the door segment in the construction products industry group 
the heating and cooling segment produces and sells gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters and fan coils from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  wfc of colton  california 
the evaporative cooling segment produces and sells evaporative coolers from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  pmi of phoenix  arizona 
sales of these two segments are nationwide  but are concentrated in the southwestern united states 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies are 
table of contents offered from numerous locations along the southern front range of colorado operated by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries collectively referred to as tmc 
the company sold its concrete operations in the denver market  rmrm on july  the operations of rmrm are reported as discontinued operations for both of the reported years 
doors are fabricated and sold along with the related hardware from colorado springs and pueblo through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  mdhi of pueblo  colorado 
sales of these two segments are highly concentrated in the front range area in colorado although door sales are also made throughout the united states 
sales of all four segments are affected by the level of construction activity in the areas served and general economic conditions  however sales of furnaces and evaporative coolers are less affected by the level of construction activity as a large portion of their sales are for replacements 
weather conditions in the areas served also affect sales 
although sales in all four segments were affected by these factors in  the effect was much more pronounced in in addition to the above reporting segments  an unallocated corporate classification is used to report the unallocated expenses of the corporate office which provides treasury  insurance and tax services as well as strategic business planning and general management services and an other classification is used to report a real estate operation 
expenses related to the corporate information technology group are allocated to all locations  including the corporate office 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash provided from operations in was  even though the company recorded a net loss of  the principal source of cash flow from operations was a reduction in net working capital 
inventories were reduced by  in total as all of the company s business segments reduced inventories in response to a weak economy and more specifically lower sales in all but the evaporative cooling segment 
the most significant inventory reduction was in the heating and cooling segment in response to a significant reduction in fan coil demand  a reduced production schedule for furnaces and stronger than expected furnace sales in the fourth quarter of inventories were reduced here by  as a result of the lower sales  accounts receivable decreased by  the accounts receivable and inventory reduction were offset to some extent by a  reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
this change is also reflective of the lower level of sales 
investing activities in generated a net positive cash flow of  cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were  including  received from the sale of a portion of the company s sand property in colorado springs see discussion under results of operations 
the company sold its denver based ready mix business  rmrm in july for total consideration of  cash of  and a note receivable of  were received at the closing 
after deducting  cash retained by rmrm at the time of the closing the net cash proceeds from the sale were  capital expenditures in were  most of the capital spending in was in the cacs segment 
net cash used in financing activities was  funded debt  consisting of long term debt and a revolving bank loan  was reduced by a total of  long term debt was reduced by  including scheduled principal repayments of  in addition  of the proceeds from the sale of rmrm and the colorado springs sand property were used to pay down the long term debt 
the remaining  reduction in long term debt was paid at the time of the april  refinancing with proceeds from the revolving bank loan 
the revolving bank loan was reduced by a net amount of  including the  borrowed to pay down the long term debt 
in the company deposited cash of  with its casualty insurer to secure self insured claims under its casualty insurance program 
previously  these claims were secured by a bank letter of credit 
the company paid  in financing fees and other expenses associated with the refinancing 
cash balances declined from  at the end of to  at the end of the sale of rmrm also affected working capital in that the sale of the stock of rmrm included the following balance sheet items accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses  net book value of property  plant and equipment  net book value of non compete with previous owner  allocated goodwill of  accounts payable and accruals  and net deferred tax liabilities of  cash provided by operations in was  the net loss in was  inventories increased by  in most of the increase in inventories occurred at the company s two hvac businesses 
inventories in the evaporative cooling segment increased in anticipation of increased sale volume as a principal competitor went out of business in the latter part of inventories in the heating and cooling segment also were higher as furnace sales during the peak selling season september through january were less than expected 
investing activities in provided net cash of  proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were  including  from the sale of a portion of the company s colorado springs sand property 
see discussion under results of operations in addition the company sold a small aggregate operation in the first quarter of for a total consideration of  including the assumption by the buyer of  in liabilities associated with the operation 
this operation did not supply aggregates to the company s ready mix concrete business and management did not consider it to be a strategic part of its business 
net cash used in financing 
table of contents activities in was  including scheduled long term debt payments of  and a reduction in revolving credit of  cash balances decreased by  from  at the end of to  at the end of capital expenditures in and were  and  including  that was included in accounts payable at january  respectively 
in both years the capital spending was predominantly in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
in expenditures in this segment were  including  to purchase two aggregates plants that were previously leased   to complete the slurry wall associated with the new mining phase at the pueblo aggregates operation   to purchase mixer trucks that were previously leased and  for the land movement monitoring system for the pikeview quarry 
the door segment spent  in for a new roof for its colorado springs fabrication and office facility 
capital expenditures in included approximately  for the slurry wall and other expenditures related to the new mining phase at the pueblo aggregates operation 
budgeted capital spending for is approximately  projected depreciation  depletion and amortization are approximately  planned capital expenditures for the cacs segment are approximately  including  for the purchase of three front end loaders currently under lease 
the company is working on a new mining plan for the pikeview quarry 
this effort will require some time and planning on the part of management in developing a mining and reclamation plan and obtaining the required permits from the state of colorado 
some outside consulting fees will also likely be necessary 
however  the company does not expect that significant capital expenditures will be required at the pikeview quarry should the company obtain the permits to resume mining operations 
the two hvac businesses are planning on spending approximately  for various production equipment  tooling and dies and facilities improvements 
the company intends to limit capital spending in to essential items 
the company expects to fund the planned capital expenditures from operating cash flow or funds available from the revolving credit facility 
sales of the company s hvac products are seasonal except for fan coils 
sales of furnaces  heaters and evaporative coolers are sensitive to weather conditions particularly during the peak selling season 
fan coil sales are  to a significant extent  dependent on commercial construction  particularly for hotels 
revenues in the cacs segment are primarily dependent on the level of construction activity along the front range in southern colorado 
the level of construction activity over the past two years has substantially subsided due to the economic downturn and turmoil in the financial markets that has prevailed throughout most of the united states 
price competition tends to intensify in this segment when demand is weak 
inclement weather during the winter months in southern colorado can result in significantly reduced sales in those months even under robust economic conditions 
sales for the door segment are not as seasonal nor are they much affected by weather conditions 
historically  the company has experienced operating losses during the first quarter except when the weather is mild and demand strong along the front range 
operating results typically improve in the second and third quarters reflecting more favorable weather conditions in southern colorado and the seasonal sales of the evaporative cooling segment 
fourth quarter results can vary based on weather conditions in colorado as well as in the principal markets for the company s heating equipment 
the company typically experiences operating cash flow deficits during the first half of the year reflecting operating results  the use of sales dating programs extended payment terms related to the evaporative cooling segment and payments of the prior year s accrued incentive bonuses and company profit sharing contributions  if any 
as a result  the company s borrowings against its revolving credit facility tend to peak during the second quarter and then decline over the remainder of the year 
revolving credit and term loan agreement on april  the company entered into a secured credit agreement credit agreement under which the bank lender initially provided a total credit facility of  consisting of a  revolving credit facility reduced by letters of credit that may be issued by the lender on the company s behalf and a  term loan facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventories  machinery  equipment  vehicles  certain real estate and the common stock of all of the company s subsidiaries 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventories 
inventory borrowings are limited to a maximum of   after april  
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based on a performance based libor or prime rate option 
for purposes of computing the performance based rate  the base libor rate will not be less than and the base prime rate will not be less than 
at january  the company s effective interest rate under the libor option was and under the prime rate option 
the company also paid certain underwriting and arrangement fees at the time of closing 
the credit agreement requires the company to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth  ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  debt service coverage and to maintain certain ratios of consolidated debt to cash flow as defined 
the credit agreement places a limit on the amount of annual capital expenditures 
additional borrowings  acquisition of stock of other companies  purchase of treasury shares and payment of cash dividends are either limited or require prior approval by the lender 
payment of accrued interest is due monthly or at the end of the applicable libor period on both the revolving credit borrowings and the term debt 
table of contents borrowings 
principal payments under the term loan are due quarterly with a final payment of all remaining unpaid principal originally due april  on november  the credit agreement was amended reducing the revolving credit facility to  on april  a second amendment to the credit agreement accelerated the final payment of all remaining unpaid principal borrowings to august  the quarterly principal payment amounts were not changed from those set forth in the credit agreement 
the second amendment also revised some of the financial covenants as discussed more fully in note to the financial statements 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of january  were  the highest balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility during was  average outstanding revolving credit during the year was  the weighted average interest rates on the outstanding revolving credit and term debt in and were and  respectively 
the rate for includes the effect of the interest rate swap discussed below 
at all times since the inception of the credit agreement  the company had sufficient qualifying assets such that the maximum revolving credit facility was immediately available and is expected to be available for the foreseeable future 
the lender required the company to enter into an interest rate swap transaction to hedge the interest rate on  of term debt 
on may  the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction for a notional amount of  whereby the company pays a fixed rate of on  and receives a floating rate equivalent to the day libor rate but not less than 
since the inception of this agreement the day libor rate has remained below 
hence  the effect of the transaction has been  thus far  to increase the company s effective interest rate by 
the notional amount decreases as follows september  december  march  the interest rate swap transaction terminates on april  in april the company deposited cash of  with its casualty insurance carrier to serve as collateral for the self insured obligations under the company s casualty insurance program 
previously these obligations were secured by a bank letter of credit 
this deposit was funded with borrowings under the revolving credit line 
at the end of the period ended january  the company was not in compliance with the minimum adjusted ebitda and fixed charge coverage covenants of the credit agreement 
as a result  effective january  the default rate provision of the credit agreement increases the interest rate on all outstanding revolving and long term debt by 
non compliance with the financial covenants in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default under the agreement 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the lenders may  among other things  terminate their lending commitments  in whole or in part  declare all or any part of the company s borrowings to be due and payable  and or require the company to collateralize with cash any or all letters of credit provided by the lender 
a waiver of the event of default relating to compliance with the minimum adjusted ebitda and fixed charge coverage covenants was granted and a second amendment to the credit agreement was entered into on april  the second amendment provides for the following the covenants regarding the fixed charge coverage and the maximum leverage ratio have been eliminated for the duration of the amended credit agreement 
the company must maintain a minimum tangible net worth of  plus of future net income 
at january   the minimum tangible net worth  as defined  was  annual capital expenditures may not exceed  the maximum revolving credit facility line will remain at  until october  when it will then be reduced to the maturity date of the credit facility is august  the interest rate for the remaining term of the amended credit agreement will be over libor but with a libor floor of the company s effective libor borrowing rate will be 
the margin on the base or prime rate option will be the base plus with a base rate floor of the company s effective borrowing rate will be the interest rate swap transaction will remain in effect 
the credit agreement as amended on april  requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants as disclosed in the table below amounts in thousands 
table of contents financial covenant date required required amount or ratio minimum tangible net worth at all times minimum adjusted quarterly ebitda quarter ended july  quarter ended october  quarter ended january  quarter ended april  quarter ended july  maximum capital expenditures trailing months definitions under the credit agreement as amended are as follows tangible net worth is defined as net worth plus subordinated debt minus intangible assets goodwill  intellectual property  prepaid expenses and deferred charges minus all obligations owed to the company or any of its subsidiaries by any affiliate or any or its subsidiaries and minus all loans owed by its officers  stockholders  subsidiaries or employees note there are no loans owed by any of the referenced parties at january  or as of the date of this filing 
the adjusted ebitda is defined as net income plus interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization plus other non cash charges approved by the lender 
the company has prepared a projection of cash sources and uses for the next months 
under this projection  the company believes that its existing cash balance  anticipated cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the credit agreement  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
the company also expects to be in compliance with all debt covenants  as amended  during this period 
reconciliation of fair value of reporting units to market capitalization the company estimates that the aggregate fair value of its four reporting units as of january  is approximately  the fair value of the cacs reporting unit was determined as described in the critical accounting policies discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets below 
the fair value of all other reporting units was estimated by management based on a discounted cash flow valuation using a discount rate in all cases 
after deducting all outstanding funded debt  which totaled  as of january   the calculation yields a net fair value of the equity of the reporting units of  the company s market capitalization as of january  was approximately  based on a year end share price of and  common shares outstanding 
it is the company s opinion that its share price reflects the negative impact of its corporate office expenses as many of these would not be required to run the individual companies 
it is also the company s opinion that the value of it operating businesses is not diminished as a result of the corporate expenses 
therefore  in the company s opinion  in reconciling the fair value of the operating units to the market capitalization an adjustment to the market capitalization for the corporate expenses is appropriate 
using the five year average corporate office expenses after the related income tax benefit and applying a capitalization rate results in an adjusted market capitalization of  as of january  in the company s opinion  the difference between the net fair value of the reporting units and the adjusted market capitalization represents the value of the control premium 
as of january  the control premium is approximately of the adjusted market capitalization 
the company believes this level of control premium is reasonable and falls within a range based upon actual control premiums involving merger transactions of companies in the sic codes under which we operate 
a reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the adjusted market capitalization is shown in the table below 
amounts are in thousands except share data 

table of contents market capitalization market capitalization based on based on the highest december  year to date closing price closing price of per share per share estimated fair value of reporting units less outstanding funded debt as of and net fair value of reporting units market capitalization  common shares outstanding adjustment for corporate expenses after income tax effect adjusted market capitalization control premium fair value of reporting units as determined above control premium as a percentage of adjusted market capitalization a significant portion of the company s common stock is closely held 
the three largest shareholders and other officers and directors together own approximately of the outstanding shares 
the remaining shares available float represent only of the outstanding shares 
generally  there is limited trading activity in the company s shares 
on some trading days there is no trading activity 
the company s share price is subject to sharp volatility on trades of a few hundred shares or less 
for these reasons  it is the opinion of the company that its market capitalization at any given time is not indicative of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units 
insurance policies the company maintained insurance policies since march  with the following per incident deductibles and policy limits deductible policy limits product liability general liability workers compensation statutory auto and truck liability should the aggregate out of pocket payments related to the above policies exceed  during a policy year  deductibles on future claims are waived and the policies pay all amounts up to the policy limits 
should any  or all policy limits be exceeded  an umbrella policy is maintained which covers the next  of claims 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements that would be likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations in the ensuing discussions of the results of operations we define the term gross profit as the amount determined by deducting cost of sales before depreciation  depletion and amortization from sales 
the gross profit ratio is gross profit divided by sales 
discussion of consolidated results from continuing operations vs 
consolidated sales in were  a  decline compared to the lower sales were the result principally of a depressed level of construction along the front range in southern colorado and a slowdown in hotel construction 
the weak construction market in southern colorado lead to a  decline in sales in the cacs segment 
also contributing to the lower sales in this segment was the shutdown of operations at the pikeview quarry in colorado springs 
the operations at the pikeview quarry were shutdown after a landslide in december made for unsafe conditions 
a substantial reduction in hotel construction  a primary market for fan coils  lead to a  decrease in sales in the heating and cooling segment 
door sales are also influenced by the level of construction both within the state of colorado and to a lesser extent on a nation wide basis 
sales in the door segment in were down  compared to the prior year 
in spite of the weak economy  sales in the evaporative cooling segment increased by  as the result of a primary competitor exiting the domestic market in late the consolidated gross profit ratio in was  an increase of compared to normally the gross profit ratio would have decreased with such a significant decline in sales 
however  the net increase in the gross profit ratio was the result of varying experiences for each of the company s reporting segments 
the gross profit percentage in the cacs segment decreased by from to 
this was the result of the diminished sales volume and the shutdown of the pikeview quarry 
the door segment s gross profit ratio decreased from to due to more competitive pricing 
table of contents and lower sales volume 
the gross profit rate in the heating and cooling segment was higher in the evaporative cooling segment achieved a significant improvement in its gross profit ratio from to 
this improvement was the result of reduced steel costs  higher production volume and modest selling price increases 
depreciation  depletion and amortization in totaled  compared to  in the increase is primarily due to amortization of the deferred development costs at one of our aggregates operations 
selling and administrative expenses were  less in compared to this decrease reflects cost reduction actions taken throughout the year in response to the lower sales volume in all but the evaporative cooling segment 
some sales related expenses such as commissions in the heating and cooling segment and sales managers incentive compensation in the door segment were less in as a result of diminished revenues 
as a percentage of consolidated sales  selling and administrative expenses were in compared to in the prior year 
the higher percentage reflects the fixed nature of many of these expenses 
the administrative expenses of the corporate office increased by  charges related to unfunded supplemental profit sharing obligations to certain officers accounted for approximately  of this increase 
these obligations are increased or decreased  with a corresponding charge or credit to earnings  for deemed earnings or losses on the unfunded supplemental profit sharing balances 
in the company recorded a charge of  for deemed earnings 
in the company recorded a credit of  for the deemed loss on the supplemental profit sharing account balances 
the gain on disposition of property and equipment in and includes gains on the sale of a portion of the company s sand property in colorado springs in the amounts of  and  respectively 
in december the company entered into a possession and use agreement with the city of colorado springs pikes peak regional transportation authority 
under the agreement the city received an irrevocable right to possess and use the property in exchange for a cash payment of  in december the payment was based upon the city s initial appraised value of the property 
the company did not agree with the city s initial appraised value 
the city and the company agreed to continue negotiations to determine the final fair market value 
the city acknowledged that the final fair market value would not be less than the  paid in december thus the company recorded a gain of  in after deducting the  cost basis of the property 
the company and city concluded their negotiations regarding the fair market value during june and agreed upon a total final price of  or  in excess of the amount previously paid 
the real estate purchase agreement was signed on july  and the company appropriately recorded the additional proceeds of  as a gain in the second quarter of as consideration for the possession and use agreement had already been exchanged as of the year end  the profit on the transaction was determinable and collectability was not a factor 
furthermore  as of december   the city received the full risks and rewards of the land through the irrevocable possession and use agreement 
after december   the company had no further obligation or continuing involvement with the property such as preparing the land for sale  therefore  the earnings process was complete with regards to the original transaction 
while there was a potential for additional consideration from the sale of the land in the future  such additional amounts were not determinable as of the year end 
as a result  the additional proceeds were recorded when the final amount was determined 
prior to july   any anticipated additional proceeds would have been considered a gain contingency 
gain on sale of property and equipment in also included a gain of  from the sale of a small aggregate operation that the company determined was not a strategic part of its business 
net interest expense related to continuing operations in was  compared to  in average outstanding funded debt was  less in and the weighted average interest rate in was approximately compared to in however  at year end  the average interest rate on outstanding funded debt was approximately 
the results from discontinued operations include approximately  and  of interest expense for and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory income tax rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  tax credits and other tax items 
the effective income tax rate related to the loss from continuing operations in was a benefit of 
the principal difference between the effective income tax rate for and the federal statutory rate of is due to the reversal of previously recorded tax contingencies related to tax returns that have been audited by the irs and closed 
the company has filed a business interruption claim with regard to the incident that lead to the cessation of operations at the pikeview quarry 
the claim is currently being reviewed by the insurance company 
no recovery has been anticipated or recorded in the results of operations 
discontinued operation the results of discontinued operations reflect the operations of rmrm  a former subsidiary that was sold on july  the loss includes a loss from operations before income tax benefits of  and a loss before income tax benefit 
table of contents on the sale of the stock of the subsidiary of approximately  the income tax benefits associated with the discontinued operation in were approximately  in the net loss from the operations of rmrm was  net of the income tax benefit of the company operates four businesses in two industry groups 
the businesses are seasonal  weather sensitive and subject to cyclical factors 
the following addresses various aspects of operating performance focusing on the reportable segments within each of the two industry groups 
construction products industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the construction products industry group for the fiscal years and amounts in thousands 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies door revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment vs 
sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment fell by  due to the weak construction market 
housing starts in the served market area were at or near record lows 
the preponderance of the sales in was from commercial  military or public construction projects 
ready mix concrete volume was lower in compared to in the concrete business  gross profit on a per unit cubic yard basis improved in due to lower fuel and cement costs and some higher concrete prices on certain high specification jobs that were completed in the first half of however  the gross profit of the concrete business fell by nearly  due to the lower sales volume 
sales of aggregates sand  crushed limestone and gravel  including aggregates consumed in the segment s concrete business were less in compared to the prior year 
the lower level of construction activity and the cessation of operations at the pikeview quarry accounted for the lower volume 
in recent years the pikeview quarry has been the principal source of rock for this segment s concrete business 
a nominal amount of sales from existing inventory were made from the pikeview quarry in sales from the pikeview quarry  including internal consumption  were approximately  less in compared to the gross loss from the pikeview quarry in was  compared to a gross profit of  in as previously mentioned  the company has filed a business interruption claim with its insurance carrier with regard to the incident that lead to the cessation of operations at the pikeview quarry 
no recovery has been anticipated or recorded in the results of operations 
net sales  including internal consumption  from all of the other aggregate locations decreased by 
the gross profit from all other aggregate operations combined was approximately  less in compared to due principally to the lower sale volume 
the gross profit of the pueblo aggregate operation improved in as the result of lower cash operating costs due to the opening of a new gravel deposit site with a more beneficial blend of rock and sand 
the company reopened its black canyon limestone quarry near colorado springs to offset some of the lost production of the pikeview quarry 
however  operations at the black canyon quarry did not begin until mid year and due to start up costs the black canyon operation generated a loss in sales of construction supplies in dropped by  compared to the gross profit from construction supplies declined by approximately  from the prior year due to the lower sales volume 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for this segment 
table of contents increased by  in the increase was due to the depreciation of deferred development costs at the segment s pueblo aggregate operation 
the prices of two commodities  cement and diesel fuel  can have a significant effect on the results of operations of this segment 
the company negotiates cement prices with producers who have production facilities in or near the concrete markets that we serve 
the company may negotiate separate cement prices for large construction projects depending on the demand for and availability of cement from the local producers 
the company buys diesel fuel from local distributors 
it may from time to time enter into a short term arrangement with a distributor whereby the price of diesel fuel is fixed for a period of up to six months 
the company does not otherwise hedge diesel fuel prices 
changes in the cost of these two commodities has a direct dollar for dollar effect on the results of operations depending upon whether competitive conditions prevailing in the marketplace enables the company to adjust its selling prices to recover the increased costs 
door segment vs 
door sales in were  less than the previous year 
the decline in sales is related to the general economic recession and the lower level of new construction particularly within colorado 
the slower sales pace resulted in sharper bidding on those job opportunities that were available 
the lower sales volume and more competitive bidding environment lead to a decrease in gross profits for this segment of approximately  selling and administrative expenses  particularly sales managers compensation and profit sharing and incentive compensation for all of this segment s employees were reduced in compared to in total  selling and administrative expenses were approximately  lower in compared to the door segment sales backlog at the end of was approximately  compared to approximately  at the end of hvac industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the hvac industry group for the fiscal years and amounts in thousands 
heating and cooling evaporative cooling revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets heating and cooling segment vs 
sales in the heating and cooling segment fell by  compared to virtually all of the decrease was the result of a decline in fan coils sales 
the lower fan coil sales reflect the slowdown in hotel construction in particular and commercial construction in general 
sales of furnaces and heaters in were about the same as in the segment s gross profit was  lower due to the lower sales 
the gross profit ratio increased by 
in spite of lower production volume 
reduced steel and other commodity costs offset the effect of the volume reduction and its impact on factory overhead absorption 
in response to the business slowdown  selling and administrative expenses were reduced by approximately  in compared to the prices of two commodities  steel and copper fuel  can have a significant effect on the results of operations of this segment 
we have not entered into any formal hedging arrangements 
table of contents with regard to steel 
on one occasion in we entered into a hedging contract fixed price swap where we fixed the price of copper for a period of approximately months for a stated amount of copper 
we did not elect hedge accounting for this transaction 
the overall effect of the fixed price swap transaction was insignificant 
we are not currently a party to any hedging arrangements with regard to copper  steel or any other commodity 
evaporative cooling segment vs 
sales of evaporative coolers increased approximately in consisting of a increase in unit volume and selling price increases of approximately 
the increased unit volume was primarily due to adobe air  formerly the largest producer serving the u 
s 
market  exiting the business in late the higher sales and production volume coupled with lower steel prices see comment regarding steel in the heating and cooling segment discussion above resulted in substantially improved gross profits 
gross profit for this segment increased by approximately  compared to due to sales related expenses that typically vary with sales volume and increased bonus and profit sharing provisions selling and administrative expenses increased by approximately  outlook overall the company expects sales in to be at nearly the same level experienced in the construction market along the front range in southern colorado is not expected to substantially improve in while there has recently been an increase in the number of housing starts in the southern colorado area  the current level of housing construction is still at a very low level 
the company believes that price competition will remain sharp in the construction products industry group as it typically does when the construction market is slow 
the company is working on a mining and reclamation plan to reopen the pikeview quarry 
the plan requires the approval of the department of natural resources of the state of colorado 
if such approval is obtained  and there is no assurance that it will be obtained  the company anticipates resuming operations at the pikeview quarry in sales in the hvac industry group are also expected to be essentially unchanged from hotel construction is expected to remain at a low level 
this will be a negative influence on fan coil sales 
sales of furnaces  heaters and evaporative coolers are primarily for replacement purposes and therefore are not reliant on new construction 
however  a continuing high level of unemployment could reduce demand for these products 
the company has taken a number of cost reduction actions in and will continue to endeavor to reduce expenses especially if sales do not improve 
capital spending in will be limited to essential items and is expected to be well below the  limit imposed by the covenant in our credit agreement 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission requires all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company annually assesses goodwill for potential impairment as of the last day of its fiscal year 
in addition  to the extent that events occur  either involving the relevant reporting unit or in their industries  the company revisits its assessment of the recorded goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred and should be recognized 
as of january  the company has recorded  of goodwill consisting of  related to the cacs reporting unit and  related to the door reporting unit 
in the company charged  against earnings from discontinued operations representing the allocable portion of goodwill related to rmrm which was sold in july for purposes of measuring the fair value of the cacs reporting unit the company engages the services of an independent investment banking firm 
the fair value of this reporting unit is determined by applying three valuation methods 
these are discounted cash flow dcf valuation  an analysis of comparable transactions within the industry and comparable enterprise valuations of other public companies in the industry 
the dcf valuation involves projecting future cash flows 
the cash flow projection entails key assumptions with regard to unit sales volumes  gross profit rate per unit or per sales dollar  capital expenditures and the discount rate 
the cash flow projection assumes a gradual recovery in construction activity along the front range in southern colorado  the reporting unit s principal market area 
however  projected unit volumes do not reach levels achieved in this reporting unit during the peak of the previous business cycle 
the projections assume that the company will resume operations at the pikeview quarry in or will be able to increase production at its other aggregate operations 
the cash flow projections assume some increase in gross profit rates compared to current levels due to an increase in volume  an improvement in the relationship of selling prices for concrete relative to cement unit costs and some 
table of contents cost reductions 
the projected gross profit rates do not exceed levels previously attained 
projected capital expenditures are compatible with the projected unit sales volume 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by a discount rate that takes into consideration both the time value of money and the investment risk 
the discount rate used to determine the dcf valuation as of january  was 
the comparable transactions method estimates value based on select transactions in the construction materials industry 
transactions occurring in the years to were considered in this analysis 
transactions involving companies significantly larger than this reporting unit were excluded
