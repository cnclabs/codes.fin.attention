item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations research and development expense 

table of contents geographic area financial information our chief operating decision maker ie  chief executive officer reviews financial information on a consolidated basis  for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance 
there are no segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision makers  or anyone else  for operations  operating results and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level 
accordingly  we consider ourselves to have a single reporting segment and operating unit structure 
net product revenues by geography are based on patients locations for naglazyme and kuvan  and are based on genzyme s us location for aldurazyme

risk factors an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
other risks and uncertainties  including those that we do not currently consider material  may impair our business 
if any of the risks discussed below actually occur  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our securities to decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 

table of contents if we fail to maintain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our drugs  or if approval is delayed  we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products  our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished  and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased 
we must obtain regulatory approval before marketing or selling our drug products in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
in the us  we must obtain fda approval for each drug that we intend to commercialize 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
products distributed abroad are also subject to foreign government regulation 
naglazyme  aldurazyme and kuvan have received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed and sold in the us  eu and other countries 
firdapse has received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed only in the eu 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our other product candidates  we will be unable to market and sell those drug products 
because of the risks and uncertainties in pharmaceutical development  our product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval 
from time to time during the regulatory approval process for our products and our product candidates  we engage in discussions with the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the regulatory requirements for our development programs 
to the extent appropriate  we accommodate the requests of the regulatory authorities and  to date  we have generally been able to reach reasonable accommodations and resolutions regarding the underlying issues 
however  we are often unable to determine the outcome of such deliberations until they are final 
if we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with the inquiries and requests of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities  the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value may be reduced 
after any of our products receive regulatory approval  they remain subject to ongoing regulation  including  for example  changes to the product labeling  new or revised regulatory requirements for manufacturing practices and reporting adverse reactions and other information 
if we do not comply with the applicable regulations  the range of possible sanctions includes issuance of adverse publicity  product recalls or seizures  fines  total or partial suspensions of production and or distribution  suspension of marketing applications  enforcement actions  including injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution 
the fda and foreign regulatory agencies can withdraw a product s approval under some circumstances  such as the failure to comply with regulatory requirements or unexpected safety issues 
further  the government authorities may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of additional post marketing clinical studies 
these post marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the patient 
if data we collect from post marketing studies suggest that one of our approved products may present a risk to safety  the government authorities could withdraw our product approval  suspend production or place other marketing restrictions on our products 
if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is delayed or withdrawn  the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected 
additionally  we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products  our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased 
if we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for some of our products  our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions and our revenues will be reduced 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to develop some drugs that may be eligible for fda and eu orphan drug designation 
under the orphan drug act  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition  defined as a patient population of fewer than  in the us the company that first obtains fda approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the stated condition for a period of seven years 
orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the fda later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug 
similar regulations are available in the eu with a ten year period of market exclusivity 

table of contents because the extent and scope of patent protection for some of our drug products is limited  orphan drug designation is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation 
for eligible drugs  we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the orphan drug act to maintain a competitive position 
if we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our drug products that do not have broad patent protection  our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition and our revenues will be reduced 
even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain of our products and product candidates and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for our future product candidates  due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products  we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication 
further  even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product  that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition 
even after an orphan drug is approved  the fda can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is safer  more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care 
orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug  nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process 
to obtain regulatory approval to market our products  preclinical studies and costly and lengthy preclinical and clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain 
as part of the regulatory approval process  we must conduct  at our own expense  preclinical studies in the laboratory and clinical trials on humans for each product candidate 
we expect the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that the regulatory authorities will require will vary depending on the product candidate  the disease or condition the drug is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the particular drug 
generally  the number and size of clinical trials required for approval increases based on the expected patient population that may be treated with a drug 
we may need to perform multiple preclinical studies using various doses and formulations before we can begin clinical trials  which could result in delays in our ability to market any of our product candidates 
furthermore  even if we obtain favorable results in preclinical studies  the results in humans may be significantly different 
after we have conducted preclinical studies  we must demonstrate that our drug products are safe and efficacious for use in the targeted human patients in order to receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
adverse or inconclusive clinical results would stop us from filing for regulatory approval of our product candidates 
additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials include slow or insufficient patient enrollment  slow recruitment of  and completion of necessary institutional approvals at  clinical sites longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients  lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested  and regulatory requests for additional clinical trials 
typically  if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease  as is the case with some of our product candidates  safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time  which can range from six months to three years or more 
if we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than anticipated  we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or operations 
since we began operations in march  we have been engaged in very substantial research and development and have operated at a net loss until although we were profitable in  we operated at a 
table of contents slight net loss in depending on our future investments in research and development for existing and new programs  we could operate at an annual net loss for and possibly beyond 
our future profitability depends on our marketing and selling of naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse  the successful commercialization of aldurazyme by genzyme  the receipt of regulatory approval of our product candidates  our ability to successfully manufacture and market any approved drugs  either by ourselves or jointly with others  our spending on our development programs and the impact of any possible future business development transactions 
the extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain 
if we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis  then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations 
if we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations  our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
before we can begin commercial manufacture of our products  we  or our contract manufacturers  must obtain regulatory approval of our manufacturing facilities  processes and quality systems 
in addition  pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the fda  the state of california and foreign regulatory authorities  before and after product approval 
our manufacturing facilities have been inspected and licensed by the state of california for pharmaceutical manufacture and have been approved by the fda  the ec and health agencies in other countries for the manufacture of aldurazyme  and by the fda and ec for the manufacture of naglazyme 
in addition  our third party manufacturers facilities involved with the manufacture of naglazyme  kuvan  firdapse and aldurazyme have also been inspected and approved by various regulatory authorities 
due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture our products and product candidates  we may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal or international regulatory inspections in a cost effective manner 
for the same reason  any potential third party manufacturer of naglazyme  kuvan  aldurazyme and firdapse or our product candidates may be unable to comply with gmp regulations in a cost effective manner 
if we  or third party manufacturers with whom we contract  are unable to comply with manufacturing regulations  we may be subject to fines  unanticipated compliance expenses  recall or seizure of our products  total or partial suspension of production and or enforcement actions  including injunctions  and criminal or civil prosecution 
these possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected and we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs 
we may require additional financing to fund our future operations  including the commercialization of our approved drugs and drug product candidates currently under development  preclinical studies and clinical trials  and potential licenses and acquisitions 
we may be unable to raise additional financing  if needed  due to a variety of factors  including our financial condition  the status of our product programs  and the general condition of the financial markets 
if we fail to raise additional financing if we need such funds  we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs and our financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 
we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of capital for our operations for the foreseeable future 
the amount of capital we will need depends on many factors  including our ability to successfully market and sell naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse  genzyme s ability to continue to successfully commercialize aldurazyme  the progress  timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  
table of contents the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post marketing studies which may be required by regulatory authorities  the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes  including quality systems  and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities  the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments  any changes made to  or new developments in  our existing collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish  and whether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future 
moreover  our fixed expenses such as rent  license payments  interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial and may increase in the future 
these fixed expenses may increase because we may enter into additional licenses and collaborative agreements  additional contracts for product manufacturing  and additional financing facilities we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment securities at december  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future based on our current long term business plans 
these estimates are based on assumptions and estimates  which may prove to be wrong 
we may need to raise additional funds from equity or debt securities  loans or collaborative agreements if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
the sale of additional securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
this could result in the delay  reduction or termination of our research  which could harm our business 
if we are unable to successfully develop manufacturing processes for our drug products to produce sufficient quantities at acceptable costs  we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue  have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program 
due to the complexity of manufacturing our products  we may not be able to manufacture drug products successfully with a commercially viable process or at a scale large enough to support their respective commercial markets or at acceptable margins 
improvements in manufacturing processes typically are very difficult to achieve and are often very expensive and may require extended periods of time to develop 
if we contract for manufacturing services with an unproven process  our contractor is subject to the same uncertainties  high standards and regulatory controls  and may therefore experience difficulty if further process development is necessary 
even a developed manufacturing process can encounter difficulties due to changing regulatory requirements  human error  mechanical breakdowns  malfunctions of internal information technology systems  and other events that cannot always be prevented or anticipated 
many of the processes include biological systems  which add significant complexity  as compared to chemical synthesis 
we expect that  from time to time  consistent with biotechnology industry expectations  certain production lots will fail to produce product that meets our quality control release acceptance criteria 
to date  our historical failure rates for all of our product programs  including naglazyme and aldurazyme  have been within our expectations  which are based on industry norms 
in order to produce product within our time and cost parameters  we must continue to produce product within our expected success rate and yield expectations 
because of the complexity of our manufacturing 
table of contents processes  it may be difficult or impossible for us to determine the cause of any particular lot failure and we must effectively take corrective action in response to any failure in a timely manner 
although we have entered into contractual relationships with third party manufacturers to produce the active ingredient in kuvan and firdapse  if those manufacturers are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations  we may be unable to meet demand for these products or sell these products at all and we may lose potential revenue 
we have contracts for the production of final product for kuvan and are in final negotiations of a contract for the production of final product for firdapse 
we also rely on third parties for portions of the manufacture of naglazyme and aldurazyme 
if those manufacturers are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or satisfy demand outside of or in excess of the contractual obligations  we may be unable to meet demand for these products or sell these products at all and we may lose potential revenue 
further  the availability of suitable contract manufacturing capacity at scheduled or optimum times is not certain 
in addition  our manufacturing processes subject us to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes resulting from their use 
we may incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations 
if we are unable to effectively address manufacturing issues  we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue  have reduced margins  or be forced to terminate a program 
our manufacturing facility for naglazyme and aldurazyme is located near known earthquake fault zones  and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facility and equipment  or that of our third party manufacturers or single source suppliers  which could materially impair our ability to manufacture naglazyme and aldurazyme or our third party manufacturer s ability to manufacture kuvan or firdapse 
our galli drive facility located in novato  california is our only manufacturing facility for naglazyme and aldurazyme 
it is located in the san francisco bay area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes 
we  and the third party manufacturers with whom we contract and our single source suppliers of raw materials  are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including fires  floods  power loss and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  or any terrorist or criminal activity caused significant damage to our facilities or the facilities of our third party manufacturers and suppliers  our ability to manufacture naglazyme and aldurazyme  or to have kuvan or firdapse manufactured  could be seriously  or potentially completely impaired  and our naglazyme  kuvan  aldurazyme and firdapse commercialization efforts and revenue from the sale of naglazyme  kuvan  aldurazyme and firdapse could be seriously impaired 
the insurance that we carry  the inventory that we maintain and our risk mitigation plans may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
supply interruptions may disrupt our inventory levels and the availability of our products and cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates  or harm our business by reducing our revenues 
numerous factors could cause interruptions in the supply of our finished products  including timing  scheduling and prioritization of production by our contract manufacturers or a breach of our agreements by our contract manufacturers  labor interruptions  changes in our sources for manufacturing  the timing and delivery of shipments  our failure to locate and obtain replacement manufacturers as needed on a timely basis  and conditions affecting the cost and availability of raw materials 

table of contents any interruption in the supply of finished products could hinder our ability to distribute finished products to meet commercial demand 
with respect to our product candidates  production of product is necessary to perform clinical trials and successful registration batches are necessary to file for approval to commercially market and sell product candidates 
delays in obtaining clinical material or registration batches could delay regulatory approval for our product candidates 
because the target patient populations for some of our products are small  we must achieve significant market share and obtain high per patient prices for our products to achieve profitability 
naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse all target diseases with small patient populations 
as a result  our per patient prices must be relatively high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs and achieve profitability 
for naglazyme  we believe that we will need to market worldwide to achieve significant market penetration of the product 
due to the expected costs of treatment for our products for genetic diseases  we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient market share at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and manufacturing expenses 
if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our drug products by third party payers  the sales of our drugs would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable markets for our products 
the course of treatment for patients using naglazyme  kuvan  aldurazyme and firdapse is expensive 
we expect patients to need treatment for extended periods  and for some products throughout the lifetimes of the patients 
we expect that most families of patients will not be capable of paying for this treatment themselves 
there will be no commercially viable market for our products without reimbursement from third party payers 
additionally  even if there is a commercially viable market  if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations  our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected 
third party payers  such as government or private health care insurers  carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs 
reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third party payer  the insurance plan and other factors 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
reimbursement in the eu must be negotiated on a country by country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved 
the negotiation process in some countries can exceed months 
for our future products  we will not know what the reimbursement rates will be until we are ready to market the product and we actually negotiate the rates 
if we are unable to obtain sufficiently high reimbursement rates for our products  they may not be commercially viable or our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our international sales are made based on special access programs  and changes to these programs could adversely affect our product sales and revenue in these countries 
we make a significant portion of our international sales of naglazyme through special access or named patient programs  which do not require full product approval 
the specifics of the programs vary from country to country 
generally  special approval must be obtained for each patient 
the approval normally requires an application or a lawsuit accompanied by evidence of medical need 
generally  the approvals for each patient must be renewed from time to time 

table of contents these programs are not well defined in some countries and are subject to changes in requirements and funding levels 
any change to these programs could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in those countries and delay sales 
if the programs are not funded by the respective government  there could be insufficient funds to pay for all patients 
further  governments have in the past undertaken and may in the future undertake  unofficial measures to limit purchases of our products  including initially denying coverage for purchasers  delaying orders and denying or taking excessively long to approve customs clearance 
any such actions could materially delay or reduce our revenues from such countries 
without the special access programs  we would need to seek full product approval to commercially market and sell our products 
this can be an expensive and time consuming process and may subject our products to additional price controls 
because the number of patients is so small in some countries  it may not be economically feasible to seek and maintain a full product approval  and therefore the sales in such country would be permanently reduced or eliminated 
for all of these reasons  if the special access programs that we are currently using are eliminated or restricted  our revenues could be adversely affected 
if we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected 
our competitors may develop  manufacture and market products that are more effective or less expensive than ours 
they may also obtain regulatory approvals for their products faster than we can obtain them including those products with orphan drug designation or commercialize their products before we do 
if we do not compete successfully  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product 
government price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products  which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
we expect that reimbursement may be increasingly restricted both in the us and internationally 
the escalating cost of health care has led to increased pressure on the health care industry to reduce costs 
governmental and private third party payers have proposed health care reforms and cost reductions 
a number of federal and state proposals to control the cost of health care  including the cost of drug treatments  have been made in the us in some foreign markets  the government controls the pricing  which can affect the profitability of drugs 
current government regulations and possible future legislation regarding health care may affect reimbursement for medical treatment by third party payers  which may render our products not commercially viable or may adversely affect our future revenues and gross margins 
international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations  and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property portfolio 
as part of these cost containment measures  some countries have imposed or threatened to impose revenue caps limiting the annual volume of sales of naglazyme 
to the extent that these caps are significantly below actual demand  our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected 
we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments 
however  future price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products  which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 

table of contents if we are found in violation of federal or state fraud and abuse laws  we may be required to pay a penalty or be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we are subject to various federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws  including antikickback laws  false claims laws and laws related to ensuring compliance 
the federal health care program antikickback statute makes it illegal for any person  including a pharmaceutical company  to knowingly and willfully offer  solicit  pay or receive any remuneration  directly or indirectly  in exchange for or to induce the referral of business  including the purchase  order or prescription of a particular drug  for which payment may be made under federal health care programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
under federal government regulations  certain arrangements safe harbors are deemed not to violate the federal antikickback statute 
we seek to comply with these safe harbors 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third party payers including government payers claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent  claims for items or services that were not provided as claimed  or claims for medically unnecessary items or services 
other cases have been brought under false claims laws alleging that off label promotion of pharmaceutical products has resulted in the submission of false claims to government health care programs 
under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  we also are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payers  or knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services 
violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including fines and or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as medicare and medicaid 
many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback statute  some of which apply to referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source  not just governmental payers 
in addition  california and several other states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with both the april office of inspector general compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers and the phrma code on interactions with healthcare professionals 
neither the government nor the courts have provided definitive guidance on the application of these laws to our business 
law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws  and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws 
while we believe we have structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws  it is possible that the government could allege violations of  or convict us of violating  these laws 
if we are found in violation of one of these laws  we are required to pay a penalty or are suspended or excluded from participation in federal or state health care programs  our business  financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales and operations outside of the united states  which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
a significant portion of the sales of aldurazyme and naglazyme are generated from countries other than the united states 
additionally  we have operations in several european countries  brazil  other latin america countries and turkey 
we expect that we will continue to expand our foreign operations in the future 
international operations inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties  including changes in foreign regulatory requirements  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  political and economic instability  diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the united states  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  
table of contents difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  differing labor regulations and business practices  and potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or if foreign jurisdictions successfully challenge our interpretation of local taxation 
any of these factors may  individually or as a group  have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as we expand our existing international operations  we may encounter new risks 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing these relationships  we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions 
these or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology  we may not be able to compete as effectively 
where appropriate  we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology 
patent protection may not be available for some of the products we are developing 
if we must spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents  designing around patents held by others or licensing  potentially for large fees  patents or other proprietary rights held by others  our business and financial prospects may be harmed 
the patent positions of biopharmaceutical products are complex and uncertain 
the scope and extent of patent protection for some of our products and product candidates are particularly uncertain because key information on some of our product candidates has existed in the public domain for many years 
the composition and genetic sequences of animal and or human versions of naglazyme  aldurazyme  and many of our product candidates have been published and are believed to be in the public domain 
the chemical structure of bh and  diaminopyridine have also been published 
publication of this information may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to our products and product candidates  including without limitation composition of matter patents  which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection 
we own or have licensed patents and patent applications related to naglazyme  kuvan  aldurazyme and firdapse and certain of our product candidates 
however  these patents and patent applications do not ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons  including without limitation the following with respect to pending patent applications  unless and until actually issued  the protective value of these applications is impossible to determine 
we do not know whether our patent applications will result in issued patents 
for example  we may not have developed a method for treating a disease before others developed identical or similar methods  in which case we may not receive a granted patent 
competitors may interfere with our patent process in a variety of ways 
competitors may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us 
competitors may also claim that we are infringing on their patents and therefore we cannot practice our technology 
competitors may also contest our patents by showing the patent examiner or a court that the invention was not original  was not novel or was obvious 
in litigation  a competitor could claim that our issued patents are not valid or are unenforceable for a number of reasons 
if a court agrees  we would not be able to enforce that patent 
we have no meaningful experience with competitors interfering with our patents or patent applications 
enforcing patents is expensive and may absorb significant time of our management 
management would spend less time and resources on developing products  which could increase our operating expenses and delay product programs 
we may not have the financial ability to sustain a patent infringement action  or it may not be financially reasonable to do so 

table of contents receipt of a patent may not provide much practical protection 
for example  if we receive a patent with a narrow scope  then it will be easier for competitors to design products that do not infringe on our patent 
in addition  competition may also seek intellectual property protection for their technology 
due to the amount of intellectual property in our field of technology  we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors granted or created in the future 
for example  if a patent holder believes our product infringes their patent  the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology 
if someone else claims we infringe their intellectual property  we would face a number of issues  including the following defending a lawsuit  which takes significant time and resources and can be very expensive 
if a court decides that our product infringes a competitor s intellectual property  we may have to pay substantial damages 
with respect to patents  a court may prohibit us from making  selling  offering to sell  importing or using our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us 
the patent holder is not required to grant us a license 
if a license is available  it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
for example  we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents and patent applications 
redesigning our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of competitors may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time 
it is also unclear whether our trade secrets are adequately protected 
our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors 
enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets  such as patent litigation  is expensive and time consuming  requires significant resources and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the us are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge  methods and know how  in which case we would not be able to enforce our trade secret rights against such competitors 
we may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations  hospitals  universities or other educational institutions 
these research partners may be unwilling to grant us any exclusive rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations 
if we do not obtain required licenses or rights  we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or may be prohibited from making  using  importing  offering to sell or selling products requiring these licenses or rights 
there is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties 
the us patent and trademark office uspto has issued three patents to a third party that relate to alpha l iduronidase and a related patent has issued in canada 
if we are not able to successfully challenge these patents or a related patent in japan  if it issues  we may be prevented from producing aldurazyme in countries with issued patents unless and until we obtain a license 
the uspto has issued three patents to women s and children s hospital adelaide that cover composition of matter  isolated genomic nucleotide sequences  vectors including the sequences  host cells containing the vectors  and method of use claims for human  recombinant alpha l iduronidase 
aldurazyme is based on human  recombinant alpha l iduronidase 
corresponding foreign patent applications were filed in europe  japan and canada

the corresponding japanese application was finally rejected by the japanese board of appeals  lapsed after failure to timely file a court challenge  and cannot be re filed 
a corresponding canadian 
table of contents patent issued and covers enzyme  pharmaceutical composition  nucleic acid encoding the enzyme  host cells and vectors 
we believe that these patents are invalid or not infringed on a number of grounds 
however  under us law  issued patents are entitled to a presumption of validity  and a challenge to the us patents may be unsuccessful 
even if we are successful  challenging the patents may be expensive  require our management to devote significant time to this effort and may adversely impact marketing of aldurazyme in the us and canada 
if our manufacturing  marketing and sales agreement with genzyme were terminated  we could be barred from commercializing aldurazyme or our ability to successfully commercialize aldurazyme would be delayed or diminished 
either party may terminate the manufacturing  marketing and sales agreement  or mms agreement  between genzyme and us related to aldurazyme for specified reasons  including if the other party is in material breach of the mms  has experienced a change of control  or has declared bankruptcy and also is in breach of the mms 
although we are not currently in breach of the mms and we believe that genzyme is not currently in breach of the mms  there is a risk that either party could breach the mms in the future 
either party may also terminate the mms upon one year prior written notice for any reason 
if the mms agreement is terminated for breach  the breaching party will transfer its interest in the llc to the non breaching party  and the non breaching party will pay a specified buyout amount for the breaching party s interest in aldurazyme and in the llc 
if we are the breaching party  we would lose our rights to aldurazyme and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals 
if the mms agreement is terminated without cause  the non terminating party would have the option  exercisable for one year  to buy out the terminating party s interest in aldurazyme and in the llc at a specified buyout amount 
if such option is not exercised  all rights to aldurazyme will be sold and the llc will be dissolved 
in the event of termination of the buy out option without exercise by the non terminating party as described above  all right and title to aldurazyme is to be sold to the highest bidder  with the proceeds to be split between genzyme and us in accordance with our percentage interest in the llc 
if the mms agreement is terminated by either party because the other party declared bankruptcy  the terminating party would be obligated to buy out the other party and would obtain all rights to aldurazyme exclusively 
if the mms agreement is terminated by a party because the other party experienced a change of control  the terminating party shall notify the other party  the offeree  of its intent to buy out the offeree s interest in aldurazyme and the llc for a stated amount set by the terminating party at its discretion 
the offeree must then either accept this offer or agree to buy the terminating party s interest in aldurazyme and the llc on those same terms 
the party who buys out the other party would then have exclusive rights to aldurazyme 
the amended and restated collaboration agreement between us and genzyme will automatically terminate upon the effective date of the termination of the mms agreement and may not be terminated independently from the mms agreement 
if we were obligated  or given the option  to buy out genzyme s interest in aldurazyme and the llc  and thereby gain exclusive rights to aldurazyme  we may not have sufficient funds to do so and we may not be able to obtain the financing to do so 
if we fail to buy out genzyme s interest  we may be held in breach of the agreement and may lose any claim to the rights to aldurazyme and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals 
we would then effectively be prohibited from developing and commercializing aldurazyme 
our strategic alliance with merck serono may be terminated at any time by merck serono  and if it is terminated  our expenses could increase and our operating performance could be adversely affected 
merck serono may terminate the agreement forming our strategic alliance with them at any time by giving days prior written notice if such termination occurs prior to the commercialization of any of the products licensed under our agreement  or by giving days prior written notice if such termination occurs after the 
table of contents commercialization of such a product 
either merck serono or we may terminate our strategic alliance under certain circumstances  including if the other party is in material breach of the agreement and does not remedy the breach within a specified period of time  or has suffered certain financial difficulties  including filing for bankruptcy or making an assignment for the benefit of creditors 
although we are not currently in breach of the agreement and we believe that merck serono is not currently in breach of the agreement  there is a risk that either party could breach the agreement in the future 
upon a termination of the agreement by merck serono by giving notice or by us for a material breach by merck serono  all rights licensed to us under the agreement become irrevocable and fully paid except in those countries where restricted by applicable law or for all intellectual property that merck serono does not own 
upon a termination of the agreement by merck serono for a material breach by us or based on our financial difficulty  or upon the expiration of the royalty term of the products licensed under the agreement  all rights licensed to merck serono under the agreement become irrevocable and fully paid upon the payment of amounts due by merck serono to us which accrued prior to the expiration of the royalty term  except in those countries where restricted by applicable law or for all intellectual property that we do not own and for which we do not have a royalty free license 
upon a termination of the agreement for a material breach by us or for our financial difficulty  all rights and licenses granted by merck serono to us under or pursuant to the agreement will automatically terminate 
under the terms of our agreement with merck serono  merck serono is responsible to pay for a portion of the development costs of products developed pursuant to such agreement 
however  at any time upon days notice  merck serono can opt out of this responsibility 
if merck serono opts out  or if the agreement is terminated by either merck serono or us  and we continue the development of products related to that agreement  we would be responsible for of future development costs  our expenses could increase and our operating performance could be adversely affected 
if we fail to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaboration opportunities  we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to expand our product pipeline 
our competitors compete with us to attract organizations for acquisitions  joint ventures  licensing arrangements or other collaborations 
to date  several of our product programs have been acquired through acquisitions  such as peg pal  and several of our product programs have been developed through licensing or collaborative arrangements  such as naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse 
these collaborations include licensing proprietary technology from  and other relationships with  academic research institutions 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to identify additional opportunities and to successfully enter into partnering or acquisition agreements for those opportunities 
if our competitors successfully enter into partnering arrangements or license agreements with academic research institutions  we will then be precluded from pursuing those specific opportunities 
since each of these opportunities is unique  we may not be able to find a substitute 
several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have already established themselves in the field of genetic diseases 
these companies  including genzyme  have already begun many drug development programs  some of which may target diseases that we are also targeting  and have already entered into partnering and licensing arrangements with academic research institutions  reducing the pool of available opportunities 
universities and public and private research institutions also compete with us 
while these organizations primarily have educational or basic research objectives  they may develop proprietary technology and acquire patents that we may need for the development of our product candidates 
we will attempt to license this proprietary technology  if available 
these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions  joint venture and other collaboration opportunities  we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to expand our product pipeline 

table of contents if we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
for planning purposes  we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific  clinical  regulatory and other product development goals  which we sometimes refer to as milestones 
these milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings 
from time to time  we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones 
all of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions 
the actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates  in many cases for reasons beyond our control 
if we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of firdapse or secure pricing and reimbursement for firdapse in a timely manner  our commercial launch in the eu may be delayed in one or more countries and revenue would be adversely affected 
in december  firdapse was granted marketing approval in the eu for lems 
we expect to begin sales of firdapse in the eu in march of firdapse is manufactured on a contract basis by a third party and there is one approved manufacturer of the api for firdapse and one approved manufacturer for the final product 
we do not have an established track record with either of these third parties responsible for the supply of firdapse 
although we have entered into an agreement with a third party to produce the active ingredient in firdapse and are in final negotiations of a contract for the production of the final product for firdapse  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience a disruption in supply which could cause our launch to be delayed in one or more countries 
further  if we are unable to adequately address supply disruptions after the commercial launch of firdapse  we may be unable to meet commercial demand for firdapse and will lose potential revenue 
in addition  we have not secured pricing reimbursement for firdapse in all countries 
reimbursement in the eu must be negotiated on a country by country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved 
if we are unable to obtain pricing reimbursement in all countries in the eu  our commercial launch in the eu may be delayed in one or more countries and our revenue would be adversely affected 
we depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees 
our future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit  retain  manage and motivate our employees 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results 
because of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business  we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
in particular  the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner 
while certain of our senior executive officers are parties to employment agreements with us  these agreements do not guarantee that they will remain employed with us in the future 
in addition  in many cases  these agreements do not restrict our senior executive officers ability to compete with us after their employment is terminated 
the competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense 
due to this intense competition  we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel 
our success depends on our ability to manage our growth 
product candidates that we are currently developing or may acquire in the future may be intended for patient populations that are significantly larger than any of mps i  mps vi  pku or lems 
in order to continue 
table of contents development and marketing of these products  if approved  we will need to significantly expand our operations 
to manage expansion effectively  we need to continue to develop and improve our research and development capabilities  manufacturing and quality capacities  sales and marketing capabilities and financial and administrative systems 
our staff  financial resources  systems  procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to manage successfully future market opportunities or our relationships with customers and other third parties 
changes in methods of treatment of disease could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect revenues 
even if our drug products are approved  if doctors elect a course of treatment which does not include our drug products  this decision would reduce demand for our drug products and adversely affect revenues 
for example  if gene therapy becomes widely used as a treatment of genetic diseases  the use of enzyme replacement therapy  such as naglazyme and aldurazyme in mps diseases  could be greatly reduced 
changes in treatment method can be caused by the introduction of other companies products or the development of new technologies or surgical procedures which may not directly compete with ours  but which have the effect of changing how doctors decide to treat a disease 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities 
we are exposed to the potential product liability risks inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals 
we maintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for commercial sale of our products and for the clinical trials of our product candidates 
pharmaceutical companies must balance the cost of insurance with the level of coverage based on estimates of potential liability 
historically  the potential liability associated with product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable 
although we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our potential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance  we may be subject to claims in connection with our clinical trials and commercial use of naglazyme  kuvan  aldurazyme and firdapse  or our clinical trials for peg pal  galns and our small molecule for duchenne muscular dystrophy  for which our insurance coverage may not be adequate 
the product liability insurance we will need to obtain in connection with the commercial sales of our product candidates if and when they receive regulatory approval may be unavailable in meaningful amounts or at a reasonable cost 
in addition  while we continue to take what we believe are appropriate precautions  we may be unable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us 
if we are the subject of a successful product liability claim that exceeds the limits of any insurance coverage we obtain  we may incur substantial charges that would adversely affect our earnings and require the commitment of capital resources that might otherwise be available for the development and commercialization of our product programs 
our business is affected by macroeconomic conditions 
various macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition  including changes in inflation  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties  including those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets 
for instance  if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs  it may not be feasible to pass through price increases on to our customers due to the process by which health care providers are reimbursed for our products by the government 
interest rates  the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in order to fund our operations 
we purchase or enter into a variety of transactions  including investments in commercial paper  the extension of credit to corporations  institutions and governments and enter into hedging contracts 
if any of the issuers or counter parties to these instruments were to default on their obligations  it could materially reduce the value of the transaction and adversely affect our cash flows 

table of contents interest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of our customers distributors to purchase  pay for and effectively distribute our products 
similarly  these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers  sole source or single source suppliers to remain in business or otherwise manufacture or supply product 
failure by any of them to remain a going concern could affect our ability to manufacture products 
our stock price may be volatile  and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value 
our valuation and stock price since the beginning of trading after our initial public offering have had no meaningful relationship to current or historical earnings  asset values  book value or many other criteria based on conventional measures of stock value 
the market price of our common stock will fluctuate due to factors including product sales and profitability of naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse  manufacture  supply or distribution of naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse  progress of our product candidates through the regulatory process  results of clinical trials  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  government regulatory action affecting our product candidates or our competitors drug products in both the us and foreign countries  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  general market conditions and fluctuations for the emerging growth and pharmaceutical market sectors  economic conditions in the us or abroad  broad market fluctuations in the us  eu or in other parts of the world  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  and changes in company assessments or financial estimates by securities analysts 
in addition  the value of our common stock may fluctuate because it is listed on the nasdaq global select market 
listing on the exchange may increase stock price volatility due to trading in different time zones  different ability to buy or sell our stock  different market conditions in different capital markets  and different trading volume 
in the past  following periods of large price declines in the public market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources  which would hurt our business 
any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
in addition  the current decline in the financial markets and related factors beyond our control  including the credit and mortgage crisis in the us and worldwide  may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  our stockholders rights plan and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
we are incorporated in delaware 
certain anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult  even if a change 
table of contents in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
our anti takeover provisions include provisions in our certificate of incorporation providing that stockholders meetings may only be called by the board of directors and provisions in our bylaws providing that the stockholders may not take action by written consent and requiring that stockholders that desire to nominate any person for election to the board of directors or to make any proposal with respect to business to be conducted at a meeting of our stockholders be submitted in appropriate form to our secretary within a specified period of time in advance of any such meeting 
additionally  our board of directors has the authority to issue an additional  shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders 
the rights of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company 
also  under applicable delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
in  our board of directors authorized a stockholder rights plan and related dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock outstanding at that time 
in connection with an increase in our authorized common stock  our board approved an amendment to this plan in june our board of directors approved an additional amendment to the stockholder rights plan in february as long as these rights are attached to our common stock  we will issue one right with each new share of common stock so that all shares of our common stock will have attached rights 
when exercisable  each right will entitle the registered holder to purchase from us one two hundredth of a share of our series b junior participating preferred stock at a price of per of a preferred share  subject to adjustment 
the rights are designed to assure that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of us and to guard against partial tender offers  open market accumulations and other abusive tactics to gain control of us without paying all stockholders a control premium 
the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires or more of our stock on terms not approved by our board of directors 
however  the rights may have the effect of making an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult  and the existence of such rights may prevent or reduce the likelihood of a third party making an offer for an acquisition of us

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop and commercialize innovative biopharmaceuticals for serious diseases and medical conditions 
we select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent a significant unmet medical need  have well understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first to market or offer a significant benefit over existing products 
our product portfolio is comprised of four approved products and multiple investigational product candidates 
approved products include naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse 
naglazyme received marketing approval in the us in may  in the eu in january  and subsequently in other countries 
naglazyme net product revenues for totaled million and increased to million for aldurazyme  which was developed in collaboration with genzyme corporation genzyme  has been approved for marketing in the us  eu and other countries 
prior to  we developed and commercialized aldurazyme through a joint venture with genzyme 
pursuant to our arrangement with genzyme  genzyme sells aldurazyme to third parties and we recognize royalty revenue on net sales by genzyme 
we recognize a portion of the royalty as product transfer revenue when product is released to genzyme and all obligations related to the transfer have been fulfilled at that point and title to  and risk of loss for  the product is transferred to genzyme 
the product transfer revenue represents the fixed amount per unit of aldurazyme that genzyme is required to pay us if the product is unsold by genzyme 
the amount of product transfer revenue will eventually be deducted from the calculated royalties earned when the product is sold by genzyme 
aldurazyme net product revenues for totaled million  compared to million in kuvan was granted marketing approval in the us and eu in december and december  respectively 
kuvan net product revenues for and totaled million and million  respectively 
in december  the emea granted marketing approval for firdapse 
we expect to launch this product on a country by county basis starting in march we are conducting clinical trials on several investigational product candidates for the treatment of genetic diseases  including galns  an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis 
table of contents type iv or morquio syndrome type a  or mps iv a  peg pal  an enzyme substitution therapy for the treatment of phenylketonurics that are not responsive to kuvan and a small molecule for the treatment of duchenne muscular dystrophy 
in september  we initiated a phase clinical trial to evaluate peg pal 
results from this clinical trial are expected in the third quarter of in the first half of  we initiated a phase clinical trial of galns 
we have completed enrollment in this clinical trial and expect to report initial results in the first half of in january  we initiated a phase trial of our small molecule for the treatment of duchenne muscular dystrophy 
initial top line results from this trial are expected in the third quarter of key components of our results of operations for the years ended december   and include the following in millions total net product revenues collaborative agreement revenues cost of sales research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense net income loss stock based compensation expense see results of operations below for a discussion of the detailed components and analysis of the amounts above 
our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december   primarily due to the settlement of our medicis obligation and the acquisition of huxley pharmaceuticals  inc see liquidity and capital resources below for a further discussion of our liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net income loss and affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition and related reserves  income taxes  inventory  research and development  stock based compensation and business combinations have the greatest impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting polices have not differed materially from actual results 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and in process research and development 

table of contents although we believe the assumptions and estimates made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to the feasibility and timing of achievement of development  regulatory and commercial milestones  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products  and future expected cash flows from product sales  in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the contingent payments 
the estimated fair value of any contingent payments is determined utilizing a probability based income approach inclusive of an estimated discount rate 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include our investment in biomarin genzyme llc  long term investments  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
we regularly review long lived assets for impairment 
the recoverability of our equity investments is measured by available external market data  including quoted prices on public stock exchanges and other relevant information 
if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the recoverability of long lived assets  other than goodwill and our long term investments is measured by comparing the asset s carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
we currently operate in one business segment  the biopharmaceutical development and commercialization segment 
when reviewing goodwill for impairment  we assess whether goodwill should be allocated to operating levels lower than our single operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed for decision making purposes 
these lower levels are referred to as reporting units 
currently  we have identified only one reporting unit as per financial accounting standards board  or fasb accounting standards codification  or asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the majority of our goodwill originated from the acquisition of the orapred business in the orapred business was eliminated as a reporting unit following the sublicense of north american rights for orapred  which was previously our only separate reporting unit 
immediately prior to the sublicense  which was considered a triggering event  we performed an impairment test at the orapred reporting unit level and determined that there was no impairment at march we perform an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by assessing the fair value and recoverability of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value as determined by available market value unless facts and circumstances warrant a review of goodwill for impairment before that time 
we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of and determined no impairment of goodwill existed as of december  determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount  and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 

table of contents as a result of the restructuring of our joint venture with genzyme  we have realized most of our investment in the joint venture through the distribution of cash and inventory in february we expect that our remaining ongoing investment in the joint venture will include our investment in the joint venture s cash on hand to fund certain research and development activities related to aldurazyme and intellectual property management 
no significant impairments were recognized for the year ended december  in  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million for the decline in the value of our equity investment in summit corporation plc summit 
in  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and million for the decline in value of our equity investments in summit and la jolla pharmaceutical la jolla  respectively 
the determination that the decline was other than temporary is  in part  subjective and influenced by several factors including  the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the shares had been less than the value at the time of purchase  summit and la jolla s respective financial conditions and near term prospects  including any events which may influence their respective operations  and our intent and ability to hold the respective investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value 
based on the current market conditions  the low volume of trading in summit and la jolla s securities  respectively  and their respective current financial conditions  we determined that our investments in summit and la jolla were other than temporarily impaired as of march  and  adjusted the amount of our investments to the stock s market price on march  in june  we sold our million shares of la jolla common stock through a series of open market trades  ranging in gross proceeds of to per share  and recognized a loss of the recoverability of the carrying value of buildings  leasehold improvements for our facilities and equipment will depend on the successful execution of our business initiatives and our ability to earn sufficient returns on our approved products and product candidates 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our fixed assets may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
based on management s current estimates  we expect to recover the carrying value of such assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition products and asc topic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
our revenues consist of net product revenues from naglazyme  kuvan and aldurazyme  revenues from our collaborative agreement with merck serono and other license and royalty revenues 
milestone payments are recognized in full when the related milestone performance goal is achieved and we have no future performance obligations related to that payment 
net product revenues we recognize net product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered to the customer  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
product sales transactions are evidenced by customer purchase orders  customer contracts  invoices and or the related shipping documents 
amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities  which are primarily comprised of value added taxes related to naglazyme sales in foreign jurisdictions  are presented on a net basis in our statements of operations  in that taxes billed to customers are not included as a component of net product revenues 
we receive a to royalty on worldwide net aldurazyme sales by genzyme depending on sales volume  which is included in net product revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize a portion of this amount as product transfer revenue when product is released to genzyme as all of our performance obligations are fulfilled at that point and title to  and risk of loss for  the product has transferred to 
table of contents genzyme 
the product transfer revenue represents the fixed amount per unit of aldurazyme that genzyme is required to pay us if the product is unsold by genzyme 
the amount of product transfer revenue will eventually be deducted from the calculated royalty when the product is sold by genzyme 
we record the aldurazyme royalty revenue based on net sales information provided by genzyme and record product transfer revenue based on the fulfillment of genzyme purchase orders in accordance with the terms of the related agreements with genzyme and when the title and risk of loss for the product is transferred to genzyme 
we sell naglazyme worldwide and sell kuvan in the us and canada 
in the us  naglazyme and kuvan are generally sold to specialty pharmacies or end users  such as hospitals  which act as retailers 
we also sell kuvan to merck serono at a price near our manufacturing cost  and merck serono resells the product to end users outside the us  canada and japan 
the royalty earned from kuvan product sold by merck serono in the eu is included as a component of net product revenues in the period earned 
outside the us  naglazyme is sold to our authorized distributors or directly to government purchasers or hospitals  which act as the end users 
we record reserves for rebates payable under medicaid and other government programs as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenues are recorded 
our reserve calculations require estimates  including estimates of customer mix  to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each quarter  and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves 
we record fees paid to distributors as a reduction of revenue 
we record allowances for product returns  if appropriate  as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
several factors are considered in determining whether an allowance for product returns is required  including market exclusivity of the products based on their orphan drug status  the patient population  the customers limited return rights and our experience with returns 
because of the pricing of naglazyme and kuvan  the limited number of patients and the customers limited return rights  most naglazyme and kuvan customers and retailers carry a limited inventory 
certain international customers  usually government entities  tend to purchase larger quantities of product less frequently 
although such buying patterns may result in revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter  we have not experienced any increased product returns or risk of product returns 
we rely on historical return rates for aldurazyme  naglazyme and kuvan to estimate returns 
genzyme s return rights for aldurazyme are limited to defective product 
based on these factors and the fact that we have not experienced significant product returns to date  management has concluded that product returns will be minimal 
in the future  if any of these factors and or the history of product returns changes  an allowance for product returns may be required 
the nature and amount of our current estimates of the applicable revenue dilution items that are currently applied to aggregate world wide gross sales of naglazyme and kuvan to derive net sales are described in the table below 
revenue dilution item percentage of gross sales description rebates rebates payable to state medicaid  other government programs and certain managed care providers distributor fees fees paid to authorized distributors cash discounts discounts offered to customers for prompt payment of accounts receivable total we maintain a policy to record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
as of december   we have experienced no significant bad debts and have not recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents collaborative agreement revenues collaborative agreement revenues from merck serono include license revenue and contract research revenue earned under our agreement with merck serono  which was executed in may nonrefundable up front license fees where we have continuing involvement through research and development collaboration are initially deferred and recognized as collaborative agreement license revenue over the estimated period for which we continue to have a performance obligation 
our performance obligation related to the million upfront payment from merck serono ended in the fourth quarter of there was no cost of sales associated with the amortization of the up front license fee received from merck serono 
nonrefundable amounts received for shared development costs are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
contract research revenue included in collaborative agreement revenues represents merck serono s share of kuvan development costs under the merck serono agreement  which are recorded as research and development expenses 
allowable costs during the development period must have been included in the pre approved annual budget in order to be subject to reimbursement  or must be separately approved by both parties 
milestone payments were recognized in full when the related performance goal was achieved and we no longer had future performance obligations related to the payment 
royalty and license revenues royalty revenue includes royalties on net sales of products with which we have no direct involvement and is recognized based on data reported by licensees or sublicensees 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the royalty amount is fixed or determinable based on information received from the sublicensee and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
due to the significant role we play in the operations of aldurazyme and kuvan  primarily the manufacturing and regulatory activities  as well as the rights and responsibilities to deliver the products to genzyme and merck serono  respectively  we elected not to classify the aldurazyme and kuvan royalties earned as other royalty revenues and instead to include them as a component of net product revenues 
inventory we value our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are recognized as cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
manufacturing costs for product candidates are expensed as research and development expenses 
we consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain  and product manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained 
as such  the manufacturing costs for product candidates incurred prior to regulatory approval are not capitalized as inventory 
when regulatory approval is obtained  we begin capitalizing inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
stock based compensation of million was capitalized into inventory in the year end december   as compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development research and development expenses include expenses associated with contract research and development provided by third parties  product manufacturing prior to regulatory approval  clinical and regulatory costs  and internal research and development costs 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for research and development activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed unless there is an alternative future use of the funds in other research and development projects 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of 
table of contents deliverables 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the vendors that perform the activities 
a critical accounting assumption by our management is that we believe that regulatory approval of product candidates is uncertain  and we do not assume that products manufactured prior to regulatory approval will be sold commercially 
as a result  inventory costs for product candidates are expensed as research and development until regulatory approval is obtained in a major market  at which time inventory is capitalized at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each such award 
further stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards expected to vest  therefore the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures which are based on historical experience 
if actual forfeitures differ from estimates at the time of grant they will be revised in subsequent periods 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in determining the fair value of stock based awards  the stock based compensation expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
there was a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of million at december  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase or decrease net income loss or additional paid in capital in the period such adjustment was made 
during the three years ended december   and  we recognized income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively 
income tax expense in the years ended december   and was primarily related to income earned in certain of our international subsidiaries  california state income tax and us federal alternative minimum tax expense

the increase in kuvan gross profit in compared to is attributed to the fda approval of kuvan in december  which resulted in approximately two weeks of kuvan sales in compared to twelve months in the increase in kuvan royalty and license revenues is primarily attributed to the million milestone received in from merck serono for the emea approval of kuvan offset by the absence of the million milestone received in for the acceptance of the kuvan emea filing 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to the continued international expansion of naglazyme and commercialization of kuvan in the us the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increases in development expense for galns  a licensed product for the treatment of duchenne muscular dystrophy  and other early stage programs

both periods reflect royalties paid to third parties of 
in accordance with our inventory accounting policy  we began capitalizing kuvan inventory production costs after us regulatory approval was obtained in december as a result  the product sold in had an insignificant cost basis 
the cost of sales for kuvan in is primarily comprised of royalties paid to third parties based on kuvan net sales 
we expect us gross margins for kuvan for the foreseeable future to be in the lower range as the previously expensed inventory has been mostly depleted 
pursuant to our relationship with genzyme  we record a to royalty on worldwide net product sales of aldurazyme 
we also recognize product transfer revenue when product is released to genzyme and all of our obligations have been fulfilled 
genzyme s return rights for aldurazyme are limited to defective product 
the product transfer revenue represents the fixed amount per unit of aldurazyme that genzyme is required to pay us if the product is unsold by genzyme 
the amount of product transfer revenue will eventually be deducted from the calculated royalty rate when the product is sold by genzyme

in  aldurazyme gross margins were  compared to in aldurazyme gross margins reflect the profit earned on royalty revenue and net incremental product transfer revenue 
the change in gross margins is attributed to a shift in revenue mix between royalty revenue and net product transfer revenues 
in  the revenue mix was royalty revenues and net product transfer revenues  compared to  where the revenue mix was royalty revenues and net product transfer revenues 
aldurazyme gross margins are expected to fluctuate depending on the mix of royalty revenue  from which we earn higher gross profit  and product transfer revenue  from which we earn a lower gross profit 
total cost of sales in was million  compared to million in the increase in cost of sales in compared to is attributed to the increase in naglazyme and kuvan product sales

collaborative agreement revenues collaborative agreement revenues include both license revenue and contract research revenue under our agreement with merck serono  which was executed in may license revenues are related to amortization of the million up front license payment received from merck serono and contract research revenues are related to shared development costs that are incurred by us  of which approximately is reimbursed by merck serono 
our performance obligations related to the initial million up front license payment were completed in december therefore  periods subsequent to december  do not include amortization amounts related to this payment 
as shared development spending increases or decreases  contract research revenues will also change proportionately 
reimbursable revenues are expected to increase if peg pal successfully completes phase clinical trials and merck serono exercises its option to co develop it

the stock purchase was substantially completed in accordance with the terms of the previously disclosed securities purchase agreement dated may  and amended on january   by and among biomarin  medicis and pediatrics 
as a result of the completion of the transaction with medicis  million in cash was released from escrow pursuant to the sublicense and was reclassified from restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents in june we expect that our net cash outflow in related to capital asset purchases will decrease significantly compared to the expected decrease in capital asset purchases primarily reflects the substantial completion of our manufacturing facility and the related spending on manufacturing and lab equipment 

table of contents we have historically financed our operations primarily by the issuance of common stock and convertible debt and by relying on equipment and other commercial financing 
during  and for the foreseeable future  we will be highly dependent on our net product revenue to supplement our current liquidity and fund our operations 
we may in the future elect to supplement this with further debt or equity offerings or commercial borrowing 
further  depending on market conditions  our financial position and performance and other factors  in the future we may choose to use a portion of our cash or cash equivalents to repurchase our convertible debt or other securities 
funding commitments we expect to fund our operations with our net product revenues from our commercial products  cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments supplemented by proceeds from equity or debt financings  and loans or collaborative agreements with corporate partners  each to the extent necessary 
we expect our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments will meet our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future based on our current long term business plans and assuming that we are able to achieve our long term goals 
this expectation could also change depending on how much we elect to spend on our development programs and for potential licenses and acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and companies 
our investment in our product development programs and continued development of our existing commercial products has a major impact on our operating performance 
our research and development expenses for the three years ended december   and and for the period since inception march for the portion not allocated to any major program represent the following in millions year ended december  since program inception naglazyme kuvan galns for morquio syndrome type a r bh for indications other than pku peg pal not allocated to specific major current projects we cannot estimate the cost to complete any of our product development programs 
additionally  except as disclosed under overview above  we cannot estimate the time to complete any of our product development programs or when we expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our product development programs 
please see risk factors in this annual report on form k  for a discussion of the reasons that we are unable to estimate such information  and in particular the following risk factors included in this annual report on form k if we fail to maintain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our drugs  or if approval is delayed  we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products  our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished  and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased  to obtain regulatory approval to market our products  preclinical studies and costly and lengthy preclinical and clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain  if we are unable to successfully develop manufacturing processes for our drug products to produce sufficient quantities at acceptable costs  we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue  have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program  if we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be 
table of contents adversely affected  and if we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
we may elect to increase our spending above our current long term plans and may be unable to achieve our long term goals 
this could increase our capital requirements  including costs associated with the commercialization of our products  additional clinical trials and the manufacturing of naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse  preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates  potential licenses and other acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and companies  general corporate purposes  and working capital 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to our ability to successfully market and sell naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse  genzyme s ability to continue to successfully market and commercialize aldurazyme  the progress  timing  scope and results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post marketing studies which may be required by regulatory authorities  the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes  including quality systems and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities  the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments  any changes made to or new developments in our existing collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish  and whether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with highly rated credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to improve the safety and likelihood of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
as of december   our investment portfolio did not include any investments with significant exposure to the subprime mortgage market issues 
based on our investment portfolio and interest rates at december   we believe that a basis point decrease in interest rates could result in a potential loss in fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately million 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio 
however  we will not recognize such gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations unless the investments are sold 

table of contents the table below presents the carrying value of our cash and investment portfolio  which approximates fair value at december  in thousands carrying value cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total of cash and cash equivalents invested in money market instruments and in uninvested cash 
of short term investments invested in corporate securities  invested in us government treasuries  in certificates of deposit  in commercial paper and in equity securities 
of long term investments invested in us government treasuries  in corporate securities and in certificates of deposit 
our debt obligations consist of our convertible debt  which carries a fixed interest rate and  as a result  we are not exposed to interest rate market risk on our convertible debt 
the carrying value of our convertible debt approximates its fair value at december  foreign currency exchange rate market risk we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily related to euro and british pound revenue from sales of our products in europe 
our operating expenses in the united kingdom and other european counties are in british pounds and euros  respectively 
both serve to mitigate a portion of the exposure related to the above mentioned revenue in both markets 
we hedge a portion of our net position in assets and liabilities denominated in euros and british pounds using primarily forward contracts 
we also hedge a percentage of our forecasted international revenue with forward contracts 
our hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
in the second quarter of  we commenced hedging a portion of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to help mitigate short term exposure to fluctuations of the currency by entering into foreign exchange forward rate contracts 
these contracts have maturities of less than months 
our hedging programs are expected to reduce  but do not entirely eliminate  the short term impact of currency exchange rate movements in operating expenses 
as of december   we had foreign currency forward contracts to sell approximately million in euros and million in british pounds 
as of december   our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had a fair value of million  of which million is included in other current assets  and million is included in accrued expenses 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
the counterparty to these forward contracts is a creditworthy multinational commercial bank  which minimizes the risk of counterparty nonperformance 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency operating expenses in europe 
instead  we believe that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenue substantially offsets the local currency operating expenses 
we regularly review our hedging program and may  as part of this review  make changes to the program 

table of contents based on our overall currency rate exposures at december   we expect that a near term fluctuation of the us dollar could result in the potential change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets and investments by approximately million 
we expect to enter into new transactions based in foreign currencies that could be impacted by changes in exchange rates 
at december   we had cash of approximately million denominated in foreign country currencies  which represented approximately of the total investment portfolio 
as a result  our investment portfolio is subject to limited amounts of foreign exchange risk
