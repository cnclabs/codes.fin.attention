item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all expectations  forecasts  assumptions  and beliefs about our future financial results  condition  operations  strategic plans  and performance are forward looking statements  as described in more detail in part i  item under the heading forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially because of a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in part i  item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
historical statements made herein are accurate only as of the date of filing of this annual report on form k with the sec  and may be relied upon only as of that date 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
forest is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids primarily in north america 
forest was incorporated in new york in  as the successor to a company formed in  and has been a publicly held company since summary and outlook due to the downturn in the global economy in mid to late  demand for oil and natural gas fell significantly  resulting in a dramatic decrease in oil and natural gas prices in as compared to for example  the average net realized price we received for natural gas in was lower than the prices we received in and the average realized price we received for oil was lower over the same period 
as a result of the decreases in commodity prices  our reported revenues and operating cash flow in were significantly lower than they were in the decrease in commodity prices in also resulted in a decrease in the amount of our capital expenditures in capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas properties were million in compared to billion in this lower level of capital expenditure activity was intended to maintain financial flexibility and sufficient liquidity to sustain our assets and operations until the margins on oil and gas production improved 
in the second half of  we initiated a divestiture program targeted at selling certain non core oil and gas properties with the primary intent to use the proceeds from the divestures to reduce outstanding debt 
during  we completed the majority of our divestiture program with over billion of non core property sales and used the proceeds to repay all outstanding amounts under our bank credit facilities in and to redeem all of our notes due in january as a result of these transactions  we enter with a significantly improved liquidity position compared to a year ago with million of cash on hand as of january  after redeeming million of our notes due in january  billion available under our bank credit facilities  and nearly billion less debt than compared to january  in  we expect the volatility in oil and natural gas prices to continue to some extent  particularly in light of uncertain supply and demand fundamentals 
in this environment  we elected to increase the portion of our natural gas and oil production volumes that we have hedged to cover to of our expected natural gas production and nearly of our expected oil production 
we expect full year production to be lower than in due to the significant amount of non core property sales in but anticipate sequential quarter over quarter production growth starting in the second quarter of as a result of our budgeted increase in drilling activity in in our three core areas 
we also expect lower total production costs  interest costs  and depreciation  depletion  and amortization costs in as a result of our divestitures and the related reduction in outstanding debt 

table of contents results of operations forest reported a net loss of million  or per basic share  in compared to a net loss of billion  or per basic share  in both years included non cash ceiling test write downs  which were caused by a significant decline in natural gas prices starting in the fourth quarter of through the first quarter of a billion non cash ceiling test write down was recorded in the first quarter of and a billion non cash ceiling test write down was recorded in the fourth quarter of see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and assumptions full cost method of accounting for information on ceiling test write downs 
forest reported net earnings of million  or per basic share  in forest s earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depletion  depreciation  and amortization expenses  and certain other items adjusted ebitda  were million in  billion in  and million in the fluctuation in adjusted ebitda between the periods presented was primarily driven by changes in oil and gas revenues net of realized gains and losses on oil and gas derivative instruments  each as discussed below 
adjusted ebitda is considered a non gaap performance measure and reference should be made to reconciliation of non gaap measures at the end of this item for further explanation of this performance measure  as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure 
discussion of the components of the changes in our annual results follows 
we have completed a significant number of acquisition and divestiture transactions of oil and gas properties throughout the last several years which affect comparability of the results for the years presented below 
details on our acquisition and divestiture transactions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents assets in august in march  perl filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and subsequently indicated that the value of its assets is less than the amount of its senior unsubordinated debt 
as such  we estimated the fair value of the perl common stock and the subordinated note to be zero as of december  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these investments 
foreign currency exchange realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to outstanding intercompany indebtedness and advances  which are denominated in us dollars  between forest oil corporation and our wholly owned canadian subsidiary

these expenses include items such as drilling rig contract buyouts related to third party operated rigs and costs related to internally operated rigs such as rig rental costs and property taxes 
debt extinguishment costs debt extinguishment costs in related to the complete repayment of the alaska credit agreements and included million in prepayment premiums and million of unamortized debt issue costs 
franchise taxes franchise taxes are taxes paid to various states based on capital investment deployed in those states  determined by apportioning total capital as defined by statute 
income tax the table below sets forth forest s total income tax from continuing operations and effective tax rates for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands  except percentages current income tax deferred income tax total income tax effective tax rate our combined us and canadian effective tax rate generally approximates to but will fluctuate based on the percentage of pre tax income generated in the us versus canada 
our effective rate in was due to a reduction in income taxes of approximately million related to statutory rate reductions enacted in canada  the release of valuation allowances  and a lower apportioned effective state income tax rate 
the current provision for income taxes increased to million in due primarily to million in asset sales in the united states which contributed to taxable income in excess of our remaining available net operating loss carryforwards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our income taxes at the statutory rate to income taxes at our effective rate for each period presented 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our exploration  development  and acquisition activities require us to make significant operating and capital expenditures 
historically  we have used cash flow from operations and our bank credit facilities as our primary sources of liquidity 
to fund large and other exceptional transactions  such as acquisitions and debt refinancing transactions  we have looked to the private and public capital markets as another source of financing and  as market conditions have permitted  we have engaged in asset monetization transactions 
changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas directly impact our level of cash flow generated from operations 
natural gas is expected to make up approximately of our oil and gas production in and  as a result  our operations and cash flow are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for natural gas than to fluctuations in the market price for oil 
we employ a commodity hedging strategy as an attempt to moderate the effects of wide fluctuations in commodity prices on our cash flow 
as of february   we had hedged  via commodity swaps and collar instruments  approximately bcfe of our total production 
this level of hedging will provide a measure of certainty of the cash flow that we will receive for a portion of our production in however  these hedging activities may result in reduced income or even financial losses to us 
see part i  item a  risk factors our use of hedging transactions could result in financial losses or reduce our income  for further details of the risks associated with our hedging activities 
in the future  we may determine to increase or decrease our hedging positions 
as of february   all of our derivatives counterparties are commercial banks that are parties to our credit facilities  or their affiliates  with the exception of one counterparty with whom we hold basis swaps 
for further information concerning our derivative contracts  see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk  below 
the other primary source of liquidity is our combined us and canadian credit facilities  which had an aggregated borrowing base of billion as of december  these facilities are used to fund daily operations and to fund acquisitions and refinance debt  as needed and if available 
the credit facilities are secured by a portion of our assets and mature in june see bank credit facilities below for further details 
we had no amounts drawn on our credit facilities as of december  and february  the public and private capital markets have served as our primary source of financing to fund large acquisitions and other exceptional transactions 
in the past  we have issued debt and equity in both the public and private capital markets 
for example  in february  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due in a private offering for net proceeds of million and in may  we issued approximately million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets on economical terms is affected by general economic conditions  the domestic and global financial markets  the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies  our operational and financial performance  the value and performance of our equity and debt securities  prevailing commodity prices  and other macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
we also have engaged in asset dispositions as a means of generating additional cash to fund expenditures and enhance our financial flexibility 
for example  during  we sold certain non strategic assets for approximately billion  a portion of which proceeds were used to pay off the outstanding balances under our credit facilities in and redeem our senior notes due in january we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  cash flows provided by operating activities  and billion of funds available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our normal recurring operating needs  anticipated capital expenditures  and our contractual obligations 
however  if our revenue and cash flow decrease in the future as a result of a deterioration in domestic and global 
table of contents economic conditions or a significant decline in commodity prices  we may elect to reduce our planned capital expenditures 
we believe that this financial flexibility to adjust our spending levels will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations should economic conditions deteriorate 
see part i  item a risk factors  for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and financial and operating results 
bank credit facilities our bank credit facilities consist of a billion us credit facility the us facility with a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  and a million canadian credit facility the canadian facility  and together with the us facility  the credit facilities with a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  toronto branch 
the credit facilities will mature in june our availability under the credit facilities is governed by a borrowing base the global borrowing base 
the determination of the global borrowing base is made by the lenders in their sole discretion  on a semi annual basis  taking into consideration the estimated value of our oil and gas properties in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
the available borrowing amount under the credit facilities could increase or decrease based on such redetermination 
the next redetermination of the borrowing base is expected to occur in the second quarter of in addition to the semi annual redeterminations  forest and the lenders each have discretion at any time  but not more often than once during a calendar year  to have the global borrowing base redetermined 
the global borrowing base is also subject to change in the event i we issue senior notes  in which case the global borrowing base will immediately be reduced by an amount equal to for every principal amount of any newly issued senior notes  excluding any senior notes that we may issue to refinance senior notes that were outstanding on may  or ii if we sell oil and natural gas properties included in the global borrowing base having a fair market value in excess of of the global borrowing base then in effect 
the global borrowing base is subject to other automatic adjustments under the facilities 
as a result of issuing million of senior notes due in february  our borrowing base was lowered from billion to billion effective february  and as a result of the sale of certain oil and gas properties in december  our borrowing base was lowered from billion to billion effective december  as a result of the december adjustment  we reallocated amounts under the us facility and canadian facility and currently have allocated billion to the borrowing base under the us facility and million to the borrowing base under the canadian facility 
a lowering of the global borrowing base could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the global borrowing base in order to cover the deficiency 
the automatic lowering of the global borrowing base on february  and again on december  did not result in any deficiency  and therefore we were not required to repay any amounts 
borrowings under the us facility bear interest at one of two rates as may be elected by us 
borrowings bear interest at i a rate that is based on interest rates applicable to dollar deposits in the london interbank market libo rate plus to basis points  depending on global borrowing base utilization  or ii a rate based on the greatest of a the prime rate announced by the global administrative agent  b the federal funds rate plus of  and c the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus basis points 

table of contents borrowings under the canadian facility bear interest at one of three rates as may be elected by us 
borrowings bear interest at a rate that may be based on i the greatest of a the base rate announced by the canadian administrative agent with respect to canadian dollar loans  and b the sum of x a bankers acceptance rate and y basis points  ii the libo rate plus to basis points  depending on global borrowing base utilization  or iii the greater of a the rate for us dollar denominated loans made by the canadian administrative agent and b the federal funds rate plus of 
the credit facilities include terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers  and acquisitions  and also include financial covenants 
for example  the credit facilities provide that we will not permit our ratio of total debt outstanding to our ebitda as adjusted for non cash charges to be greater than i to for four consecutive fiscal quarters ending in and  ii to for four consecutive fiscal quarters ending in  and iii to at any time thereafter 
if we were to fail to perform our obligations under these covenants or other covenants and obligations  it could cause an event of default and the credit facilities could be terminated and amounts outstanding could be declared immediately due and payable by the lenders  subject to notice and cure periods in certain cases 
such events of default include non payment  breach of warranty  non performance of financial covenants  default on other indebtedness  certain pension plan events  certain adverse judgments  change of control  a failure of the liens securing the credit facilities  and an event of default under the canadian facility 
in addition  bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to forest or certain of its subsidiaries will result in an automatic acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facilities 
an acceleration of our indebtedness under the credit facilities could in turn result in an event of default under the indentures for our senior notes  which in turn could result in the acceleration of the senior notes 
under the credit facilities  we are required to mortgage and grant a security interest in the greater of of the present value of our consolidated proved oil and gas properties  or multiplied by the allocated us borrowing base 
we also are required to and have pledged the stock of several subsidiaries to the lenders to secure the credit facilities 
under certain circumstances  we could be obligated to pledge additional assets as collateral 
if our corporate credit ratings assigned by moody s and s p improve and meet pre established levels  the collateral requirements would cease to apply and  at our request  the banks would release their liens and security interests on our properties 
in addition to these collateral requirements  one of our subsidiaries  forest oil permian corporation  is a subsidiary guarantor of the credit facilities 
of the billion total nominal amount under the credit facilities  jpmorgan and seven other banks hold approximately of the total commitments  with each of these eight lenders holding an equal share 
with respect to the other of the total commitments  no single lender holds more than of the total commitments 
from time to time  we engage in other transactions with a number of the lenders under the credit facilities 
such lenders or their affiliates may serve as underwriters or initial purchasers of our debt and equity securities  act as agent or directly purchase our production  or serve as counterparties to our commodity and interest rate derivative agreements 
as of february   our primary derivative counterparties are lenders and their affiliates  with six such lenders accounting for approximately bcfe  or of our hedged production 
our obligations under our existing derivative agreements with our lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under our 
table of contents credit facilities 
see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk  below for additional details concerning our derivative arrangements 
as of december  and february   there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities 
the company had used the credit facilities for approximately million in letters of credit at december  credit ratings our credit risk is evaluated by two independent rating agencies based on publicly available information and information obtained during our ongoing discussions with the rating agencies 
moody s investor services and standard poor s rating services currently rate each series of our senior notes and  in addition  they have assigned forest a general credit rating 
our credit facilities include provisions that are linked to our credit ratings 
for example  our collateral requirements will vary based on our credit ratings  however  we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of amounts due under credit facilities or the debt issued under the indentures for our senior notes 
the indentures for our senior notes also include terms linked to our credit ratings 
these terms allow us greater flexibility if our credit ratings improve to investment grade and other tests have been satisfied  in which event we would not be obligated to comply with certain restrictive covenants included in the indentures 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of any financing activities will be affected by our credit rating at the time any such financing activities are conducted

the billion fluctuation in investing cash flows between and was primarily due to a billion decrease in cash used for the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas properties and a million increase in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties 
the increase in net cash used by investing activities in as compared to was primarily due to increased acquisition  exploration  and development expenditures in and a decrease in the proceeds from asset sales in see capital expenditures below for more detail on our capital expenditures

the fluctuations in adjusted discretionary cash flow between the periods presented were primarily driven by changes in oil and gas revenues net of realized gains and losses on oil and gas derivative instruments 
reference should be made to reconciliation of non gaap measures at the end of item for further explanation of this non gaap liquidity measure 

table of contents capital expenditures expenditures for property acquisitions  exploration  and development were as follows year ended december  in thousands property acquisitions proved properties unproved properties exploration direct costs overhead capitalized development direct costs overhead capitalized total capital expenditures total capital expenditures include cash expenditures  accrued expenditures  and non cash capital expenditures including the value of forest common stock issued in connection with property acquisitions and stock based compensation capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on property acquisitions 
total capital expenditures also include estimated discounted asset retirement obligations of million  million  and million recorded during the years ended december    and  respectively 
due to the significant downturn in the overall economy in late and its impact on the price for oil and natural gas  we chose to significantly reduce our capital expenditures and drilling activity in by keeping our exploration and development capital spending near our discretionary cash flow in as a result of significantly increased liquidity in from our non core divestiture program  higher commodity prices  and focusing our development primarily on three core areas with expected high growth potential  we intend to increase our drilling activity in and have established a capital budget of million to million for the year ending december  primary factors impacting the level of our capital expenditures include crude oil and natural gas prices  the volatility in these prices  the cost and availability of oil field services  general economic and market conditions  and weather disruptions 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  after total in thousands bank debt senior notes operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other liabilities derivative liabilities total contractual obligations bank debt consists of commitment fees and letter of credit fees on the credit facilities based on the letters of credit outstanding and the global borrowing base as of december  there were no outstanding bank debt borrowings as of december  senior notes consist of the principal obligations on our senior notes and senior subordinated notes and anticipated interest payments due on each 
the senior notes due are included in since we irrevocably called them in december and redeemed them in january operating leases consist of leases for drilling rigs  compressors  office facilities and equipment  and vehicles 
unconditional purchase obligations consist primarily of firm commitments for pipe and seismic purchases and pipeline capacity 
other liabilities represent current and noncurrent liabilities that are comprised of benefit obligations and asset retirement obligations  for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations 
derivative liabilities represent the fair value of liabilities for commodity and interest rate derivatives as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown  because they are subject to continuing market risk 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments 
forest also makes delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling or production of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our total maximum commitment under these leases  through  totaled approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include i undrawn letters of credit  ii operating lease agreements  iii drilling commitments  and iv contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable  such as gas transportation commitments and derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices or interest rates 
forest does not believe that any of these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
surety bonds in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies 
as of february   we had obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain of our operations in the united states and canada in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
see part i  item business regulation for further information 

table of contents critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions full cost method of accounting the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the full cost method and the successful efforts method 
the differences between the two methods can lead to significant variances in the amounts reported in financial statements 
we have elected to follow the full cost method  which is described below 
under the full cost method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement  and abandonment activities is capitalized  and a corresponding asset retirement obligation liability is recorded 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
changes in estimates of reserves or future development costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
we have historically updated our quarterly depletion calculations with our quarter end reserves estimates 
based on this accounting policy  our december  reserves estimates were used for our fourth quarter depletion calculation 
these reserves estimates were calculated in accordance with the sec s modernization of oil and gas reporting rules  which were first effective for year end reporting 
see part i  item  business reserves and note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these rules and our estimated proved reserves as of december  companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter for each cost center 
the full cost ceiling test is a limitation on capitalized costs prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is not a fair value based measurement 
rather  it is a standardized mathematical calculation 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash write down is required 
forest recorded a billion non cash ceiling test write down in the first quarter of based on the march  spot prices for natural gas and oil of per mmbtu and per barrel  respectively 
forest recorded a billion non cash ceiling test write down in the fourth quarter of based on december  spot prices for natural gas and oil of per mmbtu and per barrel  respectively 
our december  ceiling test calculation  which included a ceiling based on oil and gas reserves calculated using twelve month average prices pursuant to the sec s modernization of oil and gas reporting rules which were effective for the first time as of december   did not result in a ceiling test write down 
in countries or areas where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs  and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion  and amortization  and the application of the ceiling limitation 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are 
table of contents assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess properties whose costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool  or reported as impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations  as applicable 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned  and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  exploratory dry holes  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis 
impairments are also assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
the full cost method is used to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities  because we believe it appropriately reports the costs of our exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis in the second quarter of the year 
in addition  we test goodwill for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statement of operations 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units  we use a discounted cash flow model to value our total estimated reserves  which include proved  probable  and possible reserves 
this approach relies on significant judgments about the quantity of reserves  the timing of the expected production  the pricing that will be in effect at the time of production  and the appropriate discount rates to be used 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of forest s weighted average cost of capital 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of our goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of and no events or circumstances have occurred since then that have indicated a possible impairment  requiring an updated test 
based on the test we performed in the second quarter of  we do not have any reporting units that are reasonably likely to fail the first step in a future goodwill impairment test 
however  due to the significant judgments that go into the test  as discussed above  there can be no assurance that our goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future 
oil and gas reserve estimates our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for 
table of contents example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production and property taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent uncertainty in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling test limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
reference should be made to reserves under part i  item business  and our proved reserves are estimates and depend on many assumptions 
any material inaccuracies in these assumptions could cause the quantity and value of our oil and gas reserves  and our revenue  profitability  and cash flow  to be materially different from our estimates  under part i  item a risk factors  in this annual report on form k 
accounting for derivative instruments we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
under the provisions of authoritative derivative accounting guidance  we may or may not elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge against changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability a fair value hedge or against exposure to variability in expected future cash flows a cash flow hedge 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedge 
changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  to the extent the hedge is effective  have no effect on the statement of operations  because changes in fair value of the derivative offsets changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
where hedge accounting is not elected or if a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as other income or expense 
we have elected not to use hedge accounting and as a result  all changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings as unrealized gains or losses in realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
estimating the fair values of our derivative instruments requires substantial judgment 
we use the income approach in determining the fair value of our derivative instruments  utilizing present value techniques for valuing our swaps and basis swaps and option pricing models for valuing our collars 
inputs to these valuation techniques include published forward prices  volatilities  and credit risk considerations  including the incorporation of published interest rates and credit spreads 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations from period to period 
for example  a hypothetical increase in the forward oil and natural gas prices used to calculate the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments at december  would decrease the net fair value of our commodity derivative instruments at december  by approximately million 
it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue 
actual gains or losses recognized related to our commodity derivative instruments will likely 
table of contents differ from those estimated at december  and will depend exclusively on the price of the commodities on the specified settlement dates provided by the derivative contracts 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in earnings in the period in which the change is enacted 
the book value of income tax assets is limited to the amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon whether future book income is sufficient to reverse existing temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets  as well as whether future taxable income is sufficient to utilize net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
assessing the need for  or the sufficiency of  a valuation allowance requires the evaluation of all available evidence  both negative and positive 
negative evidence considered by management primarily included a recent history of book losses which were driven entirely from ceiling test write downs  which are not fair value based measurements 
positive evidence considered by management included forecasted book income over a reasonable period of time and the utilization of substantially all of our net operating loss nol carryforwards in due primarily to a substantial tax gain associated with the sale of nearly billion in us oil and gas assets 
based upon the evaluation of what management determined to be relevant evidence  we have recorded a million valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary evidence utilized to determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized was management s expectation of future book income over the next several years  as well as the significant tax gain recognized in connection with the sale of our permian assets during  which allowed us to realize the majority of our deferred tax assets that were attributable to nol carryforwards 
with all of our nol carryforwards substantially used  our deferred tax asset position is now almost exclusively driven by the accelerated reduction in the book value of our oil and gas assets relative to our tax basis due to the use of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  we have recorded billion in ceiling test write downs of the book value of our oil and properties over the last two years and  even though we recorded significant tax gains on the sale of our permian assets in  no book gain was recognized for this sale under the full cost method of accounting 
while both of these factors have significantly contributed to the substantial reduction in the book value of our oil and gas properties  and therefore to the recognition of a net deferred tax asset  they have also substantially reduced our prospective depletion rate  making future book income  and therefore the reversal of book to tax temporary differences  more likely than would be the case had these ceiling test write downs and asset sales not occurred 
asset retirement obligations forest has obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore locations at the end of the oil and gas production operations 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs  or asset retirement obligations  is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments  because most of the obligations are many years in the future  and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of 
table of contents what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
inherent in the calculation of the present value of our asset retirement obligations aro are numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this asu amends existing authoritative guidance to require additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements  including the amounts and reasons for significant transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy  the reasons for any transfers into or out of level of the fair value hierarchy  and presentation on a gross basis of information regarding purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements within the level rollforward 
this asu also clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements 
the guidance within this asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements within the level rollforward  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this authoritative guidance will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations  but may require expanded disclosure about fair value measurements 
reconciliation of non gaap measures adjusted ebitda in addition to reporting net earnings as defined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  forest also presents adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion  and amortization adjusted ebitda  which is a non gaap performance measure 
adjusted ebitda consists of net earnings loss before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  and amortization  as well as other non cash operating items such as ceiling test write downs of oil and gas properties  unrealized losses gains on derivative instruments  unrealized and realized foreign currency exchange gains losses  unrealized losses on other investments  accretion of asset retirement obligations  and other items presented in the table below 
adjusted ebitda does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to gaap measurements  such as net earnings its most comparable gaap financial measure  and forest s calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
by eliminating interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  and other items  forest believes the result is a useful measure across time in evaluating its fundamental core operating performance 
management also uses adjusted ebitda to manage its business  including in preparing its annual operating budget and financial projections 
forest believes that adjusted ebitda is also useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts  investors  and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries 
as indicated  adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense on borrowed money or depletion and depreciation expense on capital assets or the payment of income taxes  which are necessary elements of forest s operations 
because adjusted ebitda does not account for these and other expenses  its utility as a measure of forest s operating performance has material limitations 
because of these limitations  forest s management does not view adjusted ebitda in isolation and also uses other measurements  such as net earnings and revenues to measure

adjusted discretionary cash flow consists of cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital items and current income taxes associated with oil and gas property divestitures 
management uses adjusted discretionary cash flow as a measure of liquidity and believes it provides useful information to investors because it assesses cash flow from operations for each period before changes in working capital  which fluctuates due to the timing of collections of receivables and the settlements of liabilities 
this measure does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures  since forest has mandatory debt service requirements and other non discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil  and natural gas liquids for our own account in the united states and canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we make use of an oil and gas hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  we enter into commodity swaps  collars  and other financial instruments with counterparties who  in general  are participants in our credit facilities 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
swaps in a typical commodity swap agreement  we receive the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower than the fixed price 
if the index price is higher  we pay the difference 
by entering into swap agreements  we attempt to fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis 
as of december   we had entered into the following swaps swaps natural gas nymex hh oil nymex wti remaining swap term bbtu per day weighted average hedged price per mmbtu fair value in thousands barrels per day weighted average hedged price per bbl fair value in thousands calendar collars forest also enters into costless collar agreements with third parties 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the ceiling price

in addition to the interest rate swaps  during the year ended december   we entered into certain interest rate swaptions  which enable the counterparties to exercise options to enter into interest rate swaps with us in exchange for a premium paid to us 
the premiums received on these swaptions are amortized as realized gains on derivatives over the term of the related swaption 
we entered into these interest rate swaptions because our targeted floating interest rates were not attainable at that time in the interest rate swap market  yet premiums were available from counterparties for the option to swap forest s fixed rate for the floating rates we had targeted

it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue

foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in several foreign currencies and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing  and investing transactions 
we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by forest outside of north america have been primarily united states dollar denominated  as have cash proceeds related to property sales and farmout arrangements 
substantially all of our canadian revenues and costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to the us dollar  we believe that any currency risk associated with our canadian operations would not have a material impact on our results of operations
