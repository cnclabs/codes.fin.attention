results by reporting segment the company s business is comprised of two reporting segments engine and drivetrain 
these reporting segments are strategic business groups  which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems 
the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after tax return on invested capital roic of its business initiatives 
the roic is comprised of projected earnings before interest  income taxes and noncontrolling interest ebit adjusted for taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required 
ebit is considered a non gaap financial measure 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebit is defined as earnings before restructuring expense  goodwill impairment charge  interest  income taxes and noncontrolling interest 
earnings is intended to mean net earnings as presented in the consolidated statements of operations under gaap 
the company believes that ebit is useful to demonstrate the operational profitability of its segments by excluding restructuring expense  goodwill impairment charge  interest  income taxes and noncontrolling interest  which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis 
ebit is also one of the measures used by the company to determine resource allocation within the company 
although the company believes that ebit enhances understanding of its business and performance  it should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net earnings or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with gaap

and gerald poor  individually and as the representative of a defendant class 
dtp sought the court s affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor management relations act or the employee retirement income security act by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april  and october   prior to the expiration of the then current collective bargaining agreements 
on september   the court found that dtp s reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw  which did not expire until april  thus  the amendments were untimely

at this stage of the litigation  the company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome  but it is vigorously defending against the suit 
environmental the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and equivalent state laws and  as such  may presently be liable for the cost of clean up and other remedial activities at such sites 
responsibility for clean up and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
the company believes that none of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
generally  this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other prps  although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

table of contents based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent public companies  will fully pay the cost apportioned to them  currently available information from prps and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs  remediation alternatives  and estimated legal fees  the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december  of million 
the company has accrued amounts that do not exceed million related to any individual site except for the crystal springs site discussed below  and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years 
in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation  the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities  then unknown to the company  relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that pre date the company s acquisition of kuhlman electric 
during  kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs  mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant 
the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary  historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area 
kuhlman electric and others  including the company  were sued in numerous related lawsuits  in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged environmental contamination 
in  the company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately of those claims and the remainder of them have since been dismissed 
in and  four additional lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others  including the company  on behalf of approximately plaintiffs  alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination 
at this stage of the litigation  the company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome  but it is vigorously defending against the suits 
conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued asc topic  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which requires the company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished 
the liability exists because the facility will not last forever  but it is conditional on future renovations even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials  which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition 
similarly  government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use ceases  the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers and capacitors when their use ceases  and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners  and lead based paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition 
the company currently has manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items 
the fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at million as of december  and million as of december  product liability like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us  the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury actions 
we believe that the company s involvement is limited because  in general  these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos 
the nature of the fibers  the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm 
as of december  and december  the company had approximately  and  pending asbestos related product liability claims  respectively 
of the  outstanding claims at december   approximately  were pending in just three jurisdictions  where significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway 

table of contents the company s policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment 
the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos related product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers 
in  of the approximately  claims resolved  only resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
in  of the approximately  claims resolved  only resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
prior to june  the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were covered by the company s primary layer insurance coverage  and these carriers administered  defended  settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement 
in june  primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits 
this led the company to access the next available layer of insurance coverage 
since june  secondary layer insurers have paid asbestos related litigation defense and settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement 
to date  the company has paid million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received million in cash from insurers 
the net outstanding balance of million is expected to be fully recovered  of which million is expected to be recovered in timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to below 
at december   insurers owed million in association with these claims 
in addition  at december   the company has estimated a liability of million for claims asserted  but not yet resolved and their related defense costs 
the company also has a related asset of million to recognize the proceeds receivable from the insurance carriers 
insurance carrier reimbursement of is expected based on the company s experience  its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to below 
at december   the comparable value of the insurance receivable and accrued liability was million 
the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows millions of dollars assets prepayments and other current assets other non current assets total insurance receivable liabilities accounts payable and accrued expenses other non current liabilities total accrued liability the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses  if any  in excess of those for which it has accrued  because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future  the allegations in such claims  the possible outcomes  or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 
a declaratory judgment action was filed in january in the circuit court of cook county  illinois by continental casualty company and related companies cna against the company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers 
cna provided the company with both primary and additional layer insurance  and  in conjunction with other insurers  is currently defending and indemnifying the company in its pending asbestos related product liability claims 
the lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage available to the company including whether the available limits exhaust on a per occurrence or an aggregate basis  and to determine how the applicable coverage responsibilities should be apportioned 
on august   the court issued an interim order regarding the apportionment matter 
the interim order has 
table of contents the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and settlement costs pro rata to time on the risk  with the pro ration method to hold the insured harmless for periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage 
appeals of the interim order were denied 
however  the issue is reserved for appellate review at the end of the action 
in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos related claims  the company has substantial additional layers of insurance available for potential future asbestos related product claims 
as such  the company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities 
although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels  due to the encapsulated nature of the products  the company s experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past  and the company s significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing  management does not believe that asbestos related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  relating to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  which is usually upon shipment of product 
although the company may enter into long term supply agreements with its major customers  each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the price is not fixed over the life of the agreements 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc topic  the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  whether held for use or disposal  including other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in market volumes  or project life  or a loss of a major customer application ie  a triggering event 
the company s impairment review is performed at each manufacturing  assembly  and technical site by local and business unit management  using data that is the basis for the company s annual budget or forecast on an interim basis and long range plan lrp 
the annual budget and lrp include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments 
if the operating site review reflects that a triggering event has occurred  the assets identified by the operating location as potentially impaired will be reviewed by management 
the review will determine if a current or future alternative use exists for additional customer applications or if redeployment of the assets to any of the company s other operating sites around the world is justified 
if a future alternative use can not be identified  a test for recoverability is performed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified 
the test compares projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of a product line or a specific customer application or asset grouping  as applicable 
if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment  management will perform a test based on the discounted future cash flows 
the discount rate used for impairment testing is the same for both long lived assets and goodwill 
if the carrying value of the long lived assets is considered impaired based on the discounted future cash flow analysis  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds their fair value 
in certain cases  management will consider estimates obtained from third parties as evidence of the assets fair value  including among other factors  the assets orderly liquidation value 
management believes that the 
table of contents estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable 
however  changes in assumptions with respect to future volumes  program project life or future asset use  in addition to future cash flows underlying these estimates could affect the company s fair value evaluations 
due to the sudden decline in the global automotive markets in and  the company reviewed the carrying value of its long lived assets 
as a result of these reviews  the company recognized million and million in impairment of long lived assets ie  plant and equipment as part of restructuring expenses in and  respectively 
the and impairment charges are broken out by segment as follows millions of dollars drivetrain group engine group total further declines in the industry could result in additional impairment charges on the company s remaining property  plant and equipment balance of  million and amortized intangible assets balance of million at december  see note  restructuring and note fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company s and impairment of long lived assets and a discussion of market based measurements 
goodwill the company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units  or more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the company s goodwill impairment review utilizes the two step impairment test required under asc topic  which requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates and growth rates 
the basis of our goodwill impairment analysis is the company s annual budget and long range plan lrp 
the annual budget and lrp include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments 
as part of the projection  we assumed the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication  on average  including fundamental industry growth  of the future performance of the business beyond the five year period into perpetuity 
as the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time  those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
we also utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios  which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our business units are reasonable 
different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value 
the primary assumptions affecting the company s december  goodwill impairment review are as follows discount rate the company used a weighted average cost of capital wacc as the discount rate for future cash flows 
the wacc is intended to represent an estimate of the company s weighted average cost of debt and equity 
we believe this discount rate is representative of a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant 
operating income margin the company utilized historical and expected operating income margins  which varied based on the projections of each business unit being evaluated 
while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate  significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company s analysis 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to an 
table of contents increase in our discount rate and decrease in our operating income margin assumptions  as it would have reduced the company s goodwill of  million as of december  millions of dollars impairment impact percentage point increase in discount rate percentage point decrease in operating income margin see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 
environmental accrual we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites 
the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability 
management s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability  including conditional asset retirement obligations  for is between approximately million and million 
we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined  in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range 
at the end of  our total accrued environmental liability was million  which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under asc topic of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 
product warranty the company provides warranties on some of its products 
the warranty terms are typically from one to three years 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claim settlements  as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the accrual 
our warranty provision over the last three years  and as a percentage of net sales  has trended as follows millions of dollars net sales warranty provision warranty provision as a percentage of net sales the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a basis point change as a percentage of sales in the assumed warranty trend on the company s accrued warranty liability income expense millions of dollars basis point decrease basis point increase at the end of  our total accrued warranty liability was million 
the accrual is represented as million in current liabilities and million in non current liabilities on our balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranty 
other loss accruals and valuation allowances the company has numerous other loss exposures  such as customer claims  workers compensation claims  litigation  and recoverability of assets 
establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization 
we 
table of contents estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 
pension and other post employment defined benefits the company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees 
costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees  retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 
using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions  the company s defined benefit pension and non pension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic disability  early retirement and other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with asc topic the determination of the company s obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits  such as retiree health care  is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
certain of the more important assumptions are described in note retirement benefit plans to the company s consolidated financial statements included in
