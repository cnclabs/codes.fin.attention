item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of atlantic american corporation atlantic american or the parent and its subsidiaries collectively  the company for each of the two years in the period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
atlantic american is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted primarily through its insurance subsidiaries american southern insurance company and american safety insurance company together known as american southern  and bankers fidelity life insurance company bankers fidelity 
each operating company is managed separately  offers different products and is evaluated on its individual performance 
in december  the company entered into an agreement for the sale of its regional property and casualty operations  association casualty insurance company and association risk management general agency  inc together known as association casualty and georgia casualty surety company georgia casualty to columbia mutual insurance company 
this transaction was completed on march  in 
table of contents accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results of the regional property and casualty operations as discontinued operations 
accordingly  unless otherwise noted  amounts and analyses contained herein reflect the continuing operations of the company and exclude the regional property and casualty operations 
references to income and loss from operations are identified as continuing operations or discontinued operations  while references to net income or net loss reflect the consolidated net results of both continuing and discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  in management s belief  conform to general practices within the insurance industry 
the following is an explanation of the company s accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management 
these accounting policies inherently require significant judgment and assumptions and actual operating results could differ significantly from management s initial estimates determined using these policies 
atlantic american does not expect that changes in the estimates determined using these policies will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity  although changes could have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  this liability includes estimates for unpaid losses on claims reported prior to december   future development on those reported claims  unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported and unpaid loss adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred prior to december  quantification of loss estimates for each of these components involves a significant degree of judgment and estimates may vary  materially  from period to period 
estimated unpaid losses on reported claims are developed based on historical experience with similar claims by the company 
development on reported claims  estimates of unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported  and estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses are developed based on the company s historical experience  using actuarial methods to assist in the analysis 
the company s actuaries develop ranges of estimated development on reported and unreported claims as well as loss adjustment expenses using various methods including the paid loss development method  the reported loss development method  the paid bornhuetter ferguson method and the reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
any single method used to estimate ultimate losses has inherent advantages and disadvantages due to the trends and changes affecting the business environment and the company s administrative policies 
further  a variety of external factors  such as legislative changes  medical cost inflation  and others may directly or indirectly impact the relative adequacy of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the company s approach is to select an estimate of ultimate losses based on comparing results of a variety of reserving methods  as opposed to total reliance on any single method 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reviewed periodically for significant lines of business  and when current results differ from the original assumptions used to develop such estimates  the amount of the company s recorded liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is adjusted 
in the event the company s actual reported losses in any period are materially in excess of the previous estimated amounts  such losses  to the extent reinsurance coverage does not exist  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
future policy benefits comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  these liabilities relate primarily to life insurance products and are based upon assumed future investment yields  mortality rates  and withdrawal rates after giving effect to possible risks of adverse deviation 
the assumed mortality and withdrawal rates are based upon the company s experience 
if actual results differ from the initial assumptions  the amount of the company s recorded liability could require adjustment 
deferred acquisition costs comprised of the company s total assets at december  deferred acquisition costs are commissions  premium taxes  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal business and are generally deferred and amortized 
the deferred amounts are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to expense in a systematic manner 
traditional life insurance and long duration health insurance deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in 
table of contents computing the related liability for policy benefit reserves 
the deferred acquisition costs for property and casualty insurance and short duration health insurance are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs are expensed when such costs are deemed not to be recoverable from future premiums for traditional life and long duration health insurance and from the related unearned premiums and investment income for property and casualty and short duration health insurance 
assessments of recoverability for property and casualty and short duration health insurance are extremely sensitive to the estimates of a subsequent year s projected losses related to the unearned premiums 
projected loss estimates for a current block of business for which unearned premiums remain to be earned may vary significantly from the indicated losses incurred in any given previous calendar year 
receivables are amounts due from reinsurers  insureds and agents and comprised of the company s total assets at december  insured and agent balances are evaluated periodically for collectibility 
annually  the company performs an analysis of the credit worthiness of the company s reinsurers using various data sources 
failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations due to insolvencies  disputes or otherwise could result in uncollectible amounts and losses to the company 
allowances for uncollectible amounts are established  as and when a loss has been determined probable  against the related receivable 
losses are recognized when determined on a specific account basis and a general provision for loss is made based on the company s historical experience 
cash and investments comprised of the company s total assets at december  substantially all of the company s investments are in bonds and common and preferred stocks  the values of which are subject to significant market fluctuations 
the company carries all investments as available for sale and  accordingly  at their estimated fair values 
the company owns certain fixed maturity securities that do not have publicly quoted values  but have an estimated fair value as determined by management of million at december  such values inherently involve a greater degree of judgment and uncertainty and therefore ultimately greater price volatility 
on occasion  the value of an investment may decline to a value below its amortized purchase price and remain at such value for an extended period of time 
when an investment s indicated fair value has declined below its cost basis for a period of time  the company evaluates such investment for other than a temporary impairment 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary 
the risks and uncertainties include  among other things  changes in general economic conditions  an issuer s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates 
in evaluating impairment  the company considers  among other factors  the intent and ability to hold these securities until price recovery  the nature of the investment and the prospects for the issuer and its industry  the issuer s continued satisfaction of the investment obligations in accordance with their contractual terms  and management s expectation that they will continue to do so  as well as rating actions that affect the issuer s credit status 
if other than a temporary impairment is deemed to exist  then the company will write down the amortized cost basis of the investment to its estimated fair value 
while such write down does not impact the reported value of the investment in the company s balance sheet  it is reflected as a realized investment loss in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company determines the fair values of certain financial instruments based on the fair market hierarchy established in accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
the fair values for fixed maturity and equity securities are largely determined by either independent methods prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners  which do not differ materially from nationally quoted market prices  when available  or independent broker quotations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following tables present assets and liabilities carried at fair value and information about the inputs used to value those financial instruments  by hierarchy level  in accordance with asc as of december   investments which are carried at fair value were measured on a recurring basis as summarized below quoted prices in active significant markets other significant for identical observable unobservable assets inputs inputs level level level total in thousands fixed maturity securities equity securities short term investments total as of december   the company s zero cost interest rate collar described below  which was valued using level criteria  was a liability of million 
the use of different criteria of assumptions of data may have yielded different valuations

the use of different criteria of assumptions of data may have yielded different valuations 
the following is a roll forward of the financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level for the periods ended december  and fixed maturity derivative securities liability in thousands balance  january  total unrealized losses included in other comprehensive loss balance  december  total unrealized gains losses included in other comprehensive loss balance  december  the company s fixed maturity securities valued with level criteria are comprised solely of issuances of pooled debt obligations of multiple  smaller financial services companies 
they are not actively traded and valuation techniques used to measure fair value are based on future estimated cash flows discounted at a reasonably estimated rate of interest 
other qualitative and quantitative information received from the original 
table of contents underwriter of the pooled offering is also considered  as applicable 
as the derivative is an interest rate collar  changes in valuation are more closely correlated with changes in interest rates and accordingly values are estimated using projected cash flows at current interest rates discounted at a reasonably estimated rate of interest 
fair value quotations are also obtained from the single counterparty to the transaction 
deferred income taxes comprised approximately of the company s total assets at december  deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for tax purposes 
these deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies

overall corporate results year ended december  in thousands revenue property and casualty american southern life and health bankers fidelity corporate and other total revenue income loss from continuing operations before income taxes property and casualty american southern life and health bankers fidelity corporate and other income loss from continuing operations before income taxes loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net loss on a consolidated basis  the company had a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the net loss in was primarily attributable to a million increase in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was due to a reassessment of the future realization of certain capital loss carryforward benefits 
the company does not currently anticipate having sufficient future capital gains to offset these capital losses 
the net loss in was attributable to a million realized investment loss related to the write down in the value of certain bonds  preferred and common stocks due to an other than temporary impairment and a million loss from discontinued operations 
income from continuing operations before taxes was million in  compared to a loss of million in the increase in income from continuing operations before taxes during was due to the absence of a comparable million impairment charge recorded in discussed previously 
in  other than temporary impairment charges were million 
such variations between years in realized investment gains and losses 
table of contents significantly influence the reported income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
the magnitude of realized investment gains and losses in any year are a function of the timing of trades of investments relative to the markets themselves as well as the recognition of any impairments on investments 
excluding realized investment gains and losses  income from continuing operations before taxes was million in  compared to million in the decrease in income from continuing operations before taxes and realized gains and losses was primarily due to several large automobile claims incurred in the company s property and casualty operations as well as higher overall loss ratios in the company s life and health operations 
the property and casualty losses were partially offset by a reduction in the accrual for profit sharing commissions due to agents 
also contributing to the decrease was a non recurring charge of million  which resulted from the termination and settlement of the company s supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
partially offsetting the decrease in income from continuing operations before taxes and realized gains and losses were the following non recurring charges recorded in million in discretionary bonus payments to certain officers of the company in connection with the sale of the regional property and casualty companies and a million goodwill impairment charge 
total revenue was million in as compared to million in premium revenue increased slightly to million in from million in the increase in premiums was attributable to new business generated by the company s life and health operations as a result of increased marketing initiatives 
offsetting the increase in life and health premiums in was a continued decline in property and casualty premiums 
total expenses were million in as compared to million in insurance benefits and losses and commissions and underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums were and in and  respectively 
the increase in expenses was primarily due to higher loss ratios in both the property and casualty and the life and health operations discussed above 
the company s property and casualty operations are comprised of american southern and the company s life and health operations consist of bankers fidelity 
a more detailed analysis of the operating companies and other corporate activities is provided below 
underwriting results american southern the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  american southern s premiums  losses  expenses and underwriting ratios year ended december  dollars in thousands gross written premiums ceded premiums net written premiums net earned premiums net losses and loss adjustment expenses underwriting expenses underwriting loss income loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio 
table of contents gross written premiums at american southern decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in gross written premiums was primarily attributable to significant decreases in the general liability and surety lines of business which resulted from weakness in the construction industry 
also contributing to the decrease in gross written premiums was the loss of one of the company s agents who had previously produced approximately million in annualized general liability business 
partially offsetting the decrease in gross written premiums was an increase in commercial automobile business marketed through another general agent 
ceded premiums decreased slightly during as compared to the decrease in ceded premiums was primary attributable to the decline in written premiums 
also contributing to the decrease were lower cession rates resulting from a new reinsurance agreement which was enacted in the fourth quarter of partially offsetting the decrease in ceded premiums were higher reinsurance rates from changes in the composition of business 
ceded premiums relative to gross written premiums increased disproportionately due to the higher reinsurance costs associated with the commercial automobile business versus the reinsurance costs in the declining lines of business 
the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  american southern s earned premiums by line of business year ended december  in thousands automobile liability automobile physical damage general liability property surety total earned premium net earned premiums decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in net earned premiums during was primarily due to the reasons discussed previously 
in  american southern s five principal states in terms of premium revenue  alabama  florida  georgia  illinois  and ohio  were relatively consistent with those in and accounted for approximately of total earned premiums for the performance of an insurance company is often measured by its combined ratio 
the combined ratio represents the percentage of losses  loss adjustment expenses and other expenses that are incurred for each dollar of premium earned by the company 
a combined ratio of under represents an underwriting profit while a combined ratio of over indicates an underwriting loss 
the combined ratio is divided into two components  the loss ratio the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and the expense ratio the ratio of expenses incurred to premiums earned 
the combined ratio for american southern increased to in from a combined ratio of in the loss ratio increased to in from in the overall increase in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to several large claims in the commercial automobile line of business 
the expense ratio decreased to in from in the decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to american southern s variable commission structure  which compensates the company s agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write 
in periods where the loss ratio increases  commissions and underwriting expenses will decrease and conversely in periods where the loss ratio decreases  commissions and underwriting expenses will increase 
partially offsetting the decrease in the expense ratio was a non recurring charge of million which resulted from the termination and settlement of the company s serp 
in establishing reserves  american southern initially reserves for losses at the upper end of the reasonable range if no other value within the range is determined to be more probable 
selection of such an initial loss estimate is an attempt by management to give recognition that initial claims information received generally is 
table of contents not conclusive with respect to legal liability  is generally not comprehensive with respect to magnitude of loss and generally  based on historical experience  will develop more adversely as time and information develops 
however  as a result  american southern generally experiences reserve redundancies when analyzing the development of prior year losses in a current period 
at december   the range of estimates developed in connection with the loss reserves for american southern indicated that reserves could be as much as lower or as much as higher 
development from prior years reserves has historically reduced the current year loss ratio  however  such reduction in the current year loss ratio is generally offset by the reserves established in the current year for current period losses 
american southern s reserve redundancies for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
to the extent reserve redundancies vary between years  there is an incremental impact on the results of operations from american southern and the company 
the indicated redundancy in was million less than that in after considering the impact on contingent commissions and other related accruals  the million decline in the redundancy resulted in a decline in income from operations before tax of approximately million in as compared to management believes that such differences will continue in future periods but is unable to determine if or when incremental redundancies will increase or decrease  until the underlying losses are ultimately settled 
contingent commissions  if contractually applicable  are ultimately payable to agents based on the underlying profitability of a particular insurance contract or a group of insurance contracts  and are periodically evaluated and accrued as earned 
approximately of american southern s business provides for contractual commission arrangements which compensate the company s agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write 
by structuring its business in this manner  american southern provides its agents with an economic incentive to place profitable business with american southern 
in periods when loss reserves reflect favorable development from prior years reserves  there is generally a highly correlated increase in commission expense also related to the prior year business 
accordingly  favorable loss development from prior years  while anticipated to continue in future periods  is not an indicator of significant additional profitability in the current year 
bankers fidelity the following summarizes  for the periods indicated  bankers fidelity s premiums  losses and expenses year ended december  in thousands medicare supplement other health products life insurance total earned premiums insurance benefits and losses underwriting expenses total expenses underwriting loss premium revenue at bankers fidelity increased million  or  during as compared to primarily due to successful marketing initiatives  recruiting of new agents  and effective utilization of the company s proprietary lead program 
premiums from the medicare supplement line of business increased million  or  in as compared to and accounted for of total earned premiums 
partially offsetting this increase in medicare supplement business was the non renewal of certain policies that resulted from continued pricing and product competition 
premiums from the life insurance line of business increased million  or  during over premiums due to an increase in sales related initiatives 
the other health products premiums increased to million in from million in  or  primarily as a result of an increase in sales of short term care products and increased business 
table of contents activities with group associations 
in  the company s five principal states in terms of premium revenue  georgia  indiana  ohio  pennsylvania  and utah  were consistent with those in and accounted for approximately of total premiums for benefits and losses increased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of premiums  benefits and losses were in compared to in the increase in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to increased medical costs within the health business 
the company continues to implement rate increases on its medicare supplement line of business to help to mitigate the impact of higher medical costs 
underwriting expenses increased million  or  during as compared to the increase in underwriting expenses during was primarily attributable to increases in advertising and agency related expenses which resulted from the company s marketing initiatives 
as a percentage of earned premiums  these expenses were in compared to in the increase in the expense ratio during was primarily due to the reasons discussed previously 
the indicated underwriting loss of million in and million in does not take into account investment income  which is a significant component in evaluating profitability  particularly in the life insurance business 
increased marketing efforts have resulted in underwriting expenses increasing at a slightly faster rate than the related premiums  thus increasing the indicated underwriting loss 
investment income and realized gains investment income decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease in investment income during was primarily due to a large amount of called securities  the proceeds from which the company was not able to reinvest at equivalent interest rates 
also contributing to the decrease in investment income was a significant decrease in the interest earned on the company s short term investments 
the company had net realized investment gains of million in and net realized investment losses of million in the net realized gains in were primarily due to the sale of the company s investments in the fixed maturity securities of general motors corporation gm and general motors acceptance corporation gmac 
on november   the company sold all of its gm and gmac holdings resulting in realized gains of approximately million 
during  the company also recorded a realized loss of million due to other than temporary impairments in its investments in the fixed maturity securities of cit group and gm  as well as certain other invested assets 
the net realized investment losses in were due to impairment charges related to the write down in the value of certain bonds  preferred and common stocks 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded investment impairments due to other than temporary declines in values  which reduced reported realized investment gains  related to the following investments in thousands corporate securities redeemable preferred stocks common and non redeemable preferred stocks other invested assets total while the impairments did not impact the carrying value of the investments  they resulted in realized losses of million in and million in management continually evaluates the company s investment portfolio and  as needed  makes adjustments for impairments and or divests investments

the majority of american southern s business is structured in a way that agents are rewarded based upon the loss ratios of the business they submit to the company 
in periods where the loss ratio increases  commissions and underwriting expenses will decrease and conversely in periods where the loss ratio decreases  commissions and underwriting expenses will increase 
further  during american southern s commission expense decreased million from solely due to the decline in premiums described above 
also contributing to the decrease in other expenses in was million in discretionary bonus payments to certain officers of the company in in connection with the marketing and sale of the regional property and casualty companies and a million goodwill impairment charge both of which did not recur in partially offsetting the decrease in other expenses in was a non recurring charge of million  which resulted from the termination and settlement of the company s serp

income taxes the primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory income tax rate result from the dividends received deduction drd  the small life insurance company deduction sld and the change in asset valuation allowance 
the current estimated drd is adjusted as underlying factors change and can vary from estimates based on  but not limited to  actual distributions from these investments as well as appropriate levels of taxable income 
the sld varies in amount and is determined at a rate of percent of the tentative life insurance company taxable income licti 
the amount of the sld for any taxable year is reduced but not below zero by percent of the tentative licti for such taxable year as it exceeds million and is ultimately phased out at million 
the change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance was due to the reassessment of the realization of tax assets related to certain capital losses on investments as well as other capital loss carryforward benefits 
during  the company increased its existing valuation allowance by million as it does not currently anticipate having sufficient future capital gains to offset these capital losses during the applicable carryforward period

table of contents impact of inflation insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect such losses and expenses  are known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
if  for competitive reasons  premiums cannot be increased to anticipate inflation  this cost would be absorbed by the company
