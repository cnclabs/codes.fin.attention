item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion is organized as follows overview 
this section provides a general description of our business  the key financial metrics that we use in assessing our performance  and anticipated trends that we expect to affect our financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the three years in the period ended december  non gaap financial measures 
this section discusses non gaap financial results that we use in evaluating the operating performance of our business 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results 
the non gaap measures discussed have been reconciled to the nearest gaap measure in a table included in this section 
liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows for the year ended december  and a discussion of our capital requirements and the resources available to us to meet those requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
this section discusses accounting policies that are considered important to our financial condition and results of operations  require significant judgment or require estimates on our part in applying them 
our significant accounting policies  including those considered to be critical accounting policies  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a leading provider of intelligent cybersecurity solutions for information technology  or it  environments of commercial enterprises  including healthcare  financial services  manufacturing  energy  education  retail and telecommunications companies  and federal  state and local government organizations worldwide 
our solutions are comprised of multiple hardware and software product and service offerings  enabling a comprehensive  intelligent approach to network security 
our security solutions provide customers with an efficient and effective network security defense of assets and applications before  during and after an attack 
we sell our network security solutions to a diverse customer base that includes global companies  global enterprises  us and international government agencies and small and mid size businesses 
we also manage two of the security industry s leading open source initiatives  snort and clamav 
key financial metrics and trends our financial results are affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions in the united states and globally  the amount and type of technology spending of our customers  and the financial condition of our customers and other entities in the industries and geographic areas that we serve 
during the second half of and continuing in  the industries and geographic areas that we serve experienced weakness as macroeconomic conditions  credit market conditions and levels of business confidence and activity deteriorated 
we are continuing to monitor economic conditions and their potential effect on our customers and on us 
an additional economic downturn could adversely affect our customers financial condition and the levels of business activity 
this could reduce demand and depress pricing for our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
during the year ended december   a significant portion of our revenue growth resulted from sales of our products and services to us federal and state government agencies 
contracts with the us federal and state government agencies collectively accounted for  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect sales to us federal and state government agencies to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in a reduction in the amount of us government purchases of our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we evaluate our performance on the basis of several key financial metrics  including revenue  cost of revenue  gross profit  and operating expenses 
we compare these key performance indicators  on a quarterly basis  to both target amounts established by management and to our performance for prior periods 
we also evaluate performance on the basis of adjusted net income  which is a non gaap financial measure 
information regarding our adjusted net income and a reconciliation to gaap net income is provided under non gaap financial measures below 
revenue we currently derive revenue from product sales and services 
product revenue is principally derived from the sale of our network security solutions 
our network security solutions include a perpetual software license bundled with a third party hardware platform 
services revenue is principally derived from technical support and professional services 
we typically sell technical support to complement our network security product solutions 
technical support entitles a customer to product updates  new rule releases and both telephone and web based assistance for using our products 
our professional services revenue includes optional installation  configuration and tuning  which we refer to collectively as network security deployment services 
these services typically occur on site after delivery has occurred 
product sales are typically recognized as revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer 
for sales through resellers and distributors  we recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product only if those resellers and distributors provide us  at the time of placing their order  with the identity of the end user customer to whom the product has been sold 
we recognize revenue from services when the services are performed 
for technical support services  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the support arrangement  which is generally months 
our support agreements generally provide for payment in advance 
we sell our network security solutions globally 
however   and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  was generated by sales to us based customers 
we expect that our revenue from customers based outside of the united states will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we strengthen our international presence 
we also expect that our revenue from sales through our indirect sales channel  comprised of resellers  distributors  managed security service providers  or mssps  government integrators and other partners  will increase in amount and as a percentage of total revenue as we expand our current relationships and establish new relationships with these third parties 
we continue to generate a majority of our product revenue through sales to existing customers  both for new locations and for additional technology to protect existing networks and locations 
product sales to existing customers accounted for  and of total product revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect product sales to existing customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our product revenue in historically  our product revenue has been seasonal  with a significant portion of our total product revenue in recent fiscal years generated in the third and fourth quarters 
revenue from our government customers has been influenced by the september th fiscal year end of the us federal government  which has historically resulted in our revenue from government customers being highest in the second half of the year 
while we expect these historical trends to continue  they could be affected by a number of factors  including another decline in general economic conditions  changes in the timing or amounts of us government spending and our planned international expansion 
notwithstanding these general seasonal patterns  our revenue within a particular quarter is often affected significantly by the unpredictable procurement patterns of our customers 
our prospective customers usually spend a long time evaluating and making purchase decisions for network security solutions 
historically  many of our customers have not finalized their purchasing decisions until the final weeks or days of a quarter 
we expect these purchasing patterns to continue in the future 
therefore  a delay in even one large order beyond the end of the quarter could materially reduce our anticipated revenue for a quarter 
in addition  because we typically recognize revenue upon shipment  the timing of our quarter end and year end shipments could materially affect our reported product revenue for a given quarter or year 
because many of our expenses are incurred before we recognize revenue  delayed orders could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and could therefore cause us to fail to meet the financial performance expectations of financial and industry research analysts or investors 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of the hardware platform  royalties for third party software  materials and labor  logistics  warranty  shipping and handling costs  expense for inventory excess and obsolescence and depreciation in the instances where we lease our network security solutions to our customers 
we allocate overhead costs  including facilities  supplies  communication and information systems and employee benefits  to the cost of product revenue 
overhead costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
as our product volume increases  we anticipate incurring an increased amount of both direct and overhead expenses to supply and manage the increased volume 
hardware unit costs  our most significant cost item  have generally remained constant on a per unit basis  however  hardware unit costs or other costs of manufacturing could increase in the future 
cost of services revenue includes the direct labor costs of our employees and outside consultants engaged to furnish those services  as well as their travel and associated direct material costs 
additionally  we include in cost of services revenue an allocation of overhead costs  as well as the cost of time and materials to service or repair the hardware component of our products covered under a renewed support arrangement beyond the manufacturer s warranty and the expense for advance replacement unit inventory excess and obsolescence 
as our customer base continues to grow  we anticipate incurring an increasing amount of these service and repair costs  as well as costs for additional personnel to provide support and service to our customers 
gross profit our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of our products  our pricing policy  technical support and professional services  new product introductions  the cost of hardware platforms  expense for inventory excess and obsolescence  warranty expense  the cost of labor to generate revenue and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
our gross profit would be adversely affected by price declines or pricing discounts if we are unable to reduce costs on existing products and fail to introduce new products with higher margins 
currently  product sales typically have a lower gross profit as a percentage of revenue than our services due to the cost of the hardware platform 
our gross profit for any particular quarter could be adversely affected if we do not complete a sufficient level of sales of higher margin products by the end of the quarter 
as discussed above  many of our customers do not finalize purchasing decisions until the final weeks or days of a quarter  so a delay in even one large order of a high margin product could reduce our total gross profit percentage for that quarter 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  incentive compensation and allocated overhead costs for our engineers  costs for professional services to design  test and certify our products  and costs associated with data used by us in our product development 
we have expanded our research and development capabilities and expect to continue to expand these capabilities in the future 
we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive to enhance our ability to serve our existing commercial and federal government markets as well as new markets for security solutions 
to meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 
accordingly  we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future  however  we expect these expenses to remain flat or decline slightly as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  incentive compensation and allocated overhead costs for sales and marketing personnel  trade show  advertising  marketing and other brand building costs  marketing consultants and other professional services  training  seminars and conferences  and travel and related costs 
as we continue to focus on increasing our market penetration  expanding internationally  increasing our indirect sales channel and building brand awareness  we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of our revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  incentive compensation and allocated overhead costs for executive  legal  finance  information technology  human resources and administrative personnel  corporate development expenses and professional fees related to legal  audit  tax and regulatory compliance  travel and related costs  and corporate insurance 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value of stock awards granted or modified after january  using the prospective transition method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and employee stock purchases 
for a prior option award that contained a market condition relating to our stock price achieving specified levels  we used a lattice option pricing model 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term and the expected stock price volatility 
based on the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards  we recognized aggregate stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased over the prior year  primarily due to the depreciation associated with our new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system implemented in the second half of  as well as the depreciation of additional lab and testing equipment purchased for our engineering department and computers purchased for new personnel 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of  to write off the carrying value of our marketing related intangible assets related to the clamav acquisition 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased over the prior year  primarily due to the depreciation of additional lab and testing equipment purchased for our engineering department and computers purchased for new personnel  as well as the depreciation associated with the newly implemented erp system 
in process research and development for the year ended december  was attributable to the august acquisition of certain assets of clamav for which technological feasibility had not yet been reached and no alternative future use existed 
other income  net and provision for income taxes 
the following table shows our other income  net and provision for income taxes in thousands year ended year ended december  variance december  variance other income  net percentage of total revenue provision for income taxes percentage of total revenue the decreases in other income  net for compared to and compared to were attributable to a decrease in interest and investment income as a result of lower average interest rates on invested cash balances 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  which resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 
our effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets  state income taxes and foreign income taxed at different rates 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  consisted of  of us income tax expense and  of foreign income tax expense 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  which resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  differed from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to the increase of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets  state income taxes and the foreign income taxed at different rates 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   consisted of approximately  of us income tax expense and approximately  of foreign income tax expense 
we continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which primarily consists of net operating loss  or nol  carry forwards  stock based compensation expense and deferred revenue 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of december  and  our deferred tax assets were fully reserved except for foreign deferred tax assets of  and  respectively  expected to be available to offset foreign tax liabilities in the future 
if our recent trend of profitability continues  we may determine that there is sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of  or decrease in  the valuation allowance 
if we were to reverse all or some part of our valuation allowance and recognize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would likely record an increase in assets on our consolidated balance sheet in the period of reversal and a corresponding tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for the amount of the reversal 
such amounts could be material to our financial statements 
seasonality our product revenue has tended to be seasonal  with a significant portion generated in the third and fourth quarters 
revenue from our government customers has been influenced by the september th fiscal year end of the us federal government  which has historically resulted in our revenue from government customers being highest in the second half of the year 
in the fourth quarter  revenues have historically been strong due to purchases by north american enterprise customers  who operate on a calendar year budget and often wait until the fourth quarter to make their most significant capital equipment purchases 
in addition  increased fourth quarter sales in europe have historically resulted in higher fourth quarter revenues following a decline in sales in the summer months due to vacation practices in europe and the resulting delay in capital purchase activities until the fall 
while we expect these historical trends to continue  they could be affected by a number of factors  including another decline in general economic conditions  changes in the timing or amounts of us government spending  and our planned international expansion 
the timing of transactions could materially affect our quarterly or annual product revenue 
quarterly timing on a quarterly basis  we have usually generated the majority of our sales in the final month of the quarter 
we believe this occurs for two reasons 
first  many customers wait until the end of the quarter to extract favorable pricing terms from their vendors  including sourcefire 
second  our sales personnel  who have a strong incentive to meet quarterly sales targets  have tended to increase their sales activity as the end of a quarter nears  while their participation in sales management review and planning activities is typically scheduled at the beginning of a quarter 
the timing of our quarter end and year end shipments also affects our quarterly and annual product revenue  since we typically recognize revenue upon shipment of the product 
non gaap financial measures in evaluating the operating performance of our business  we exclude certain charges and credits that are required by gaap 
we believe these non gaap results provide useful information to us and investors by excluding i stock based compensation  which does not involve the expenditure of cash  and ii items that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance  because either they are unusual and we do not expect them to recur in the ordinary course of our business or they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results 
the following table shows a reconciliation of gaap to our non gaap financial measures in thousands year ended december  reconciliation to adjusted net income loss gaap net income loss stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense related to ceo transition ceo transition costs expenses related to clamav acquisition in process research and development adjusted net income loss adjusted net income loss per share basic adjusted net income loss per share diluted weighted average number of shares basic weighted average number of shares diluted liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities used in provided by investing activities provided by financing activities increase net cash at beginning of period net cash at end of period investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments operating activities

financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based plans 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was primarily comprised of million of net cash proceeds of our ipo  offset by a million debt repayment 
liquidity requirements we manufacture our products through contract manufacturers and other third parties 
this approach provides us with the advantage of relatively low capital expenditure requirements and significant flexibility in scheduling production and managing inventory levels 
the majority of our products are delivered to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers 
accordingly  our contract manufacturers are responsible for purchasing and stocking the components required to produce our products  and they invoice us when the finished goods are shipped 
by leasing our office facilities  we also minimize the cash needed for expansion 
our capital spending is generally limited to leasehold improvements  computers  office furniture and lab and test equipment 
our short term liquidity requirements through december  consist primarily of the funding of working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
we expect to meet these short term requirements primarily through cash flow from operations 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet these requirements  we expect to fund these amounts through the use of existing cash and investment resources 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million and working capital of million 
as described above  our product sales are  and are expected to continue to be  highly seasonal 
we believe that our current cash reserves are sufficient for any short term needs arising from the seasonality of our business 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our operating leases 
we expect to meet these long term requirements primarily through cash flow from operations 
in addition  we may utilize existing cash resources  equity financing or debt financing to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than total one year years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply  we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon information provided by us 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
as of december   we had total purchase commitments for inventory of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from arrangements that include products with embedded software  software licenses and royalties  technical support  and professional services 
revenue from products in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations consists primarily of sales of software based appliances  but also includes fees and royalties for the license of our technology in a software only format and subscriptions to receive rules released by the vrt that are used to update the appliances for current exploits and vulnerabilities 
technical support  which generally has a contractual term of months  includes telephone and web based support  software updates  and rights to software upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services include training and consulting 
for each arrangement  we recognize revenue when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists eg  a signed contract  b delivery of the product has occurred and there are no remaining obligations or substantive customer acceptance provisions  c the fee is fixed or determinable  and d collection of the fee is deemed probable 
we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the fair value of each of the deliverables  determined based on vendor specific objective evidence 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for each of the deliverables  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which sufficient vendor specific objective evidence of fair value can be determined for any undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
if the only undelivered elements are elements for which we currently have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements based on the residual method 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our technical support based upon actual renewals of each type of technical support that is offered and for each customer class 
technical support and technical support renewals are currently priced based on a percentage of the list price of the respective product or software and historically have not varied from a narrow range of values in the substantial majority of our arrangements 
revenue related to technical support is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual period of the technical support arrangement  which is generally months 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of our other services is based on the price for these same services when they are sold separately 
revenue for professional services that are sold either on a stand alone basis or included in multiple element arrangements is deferred and recognized as the services are performed 
all amounts billed or received in excess of the revenue recognized are included in deferred revenue 
in addition  we defer all direct costs associated with revenue that has been deferred 
these amounts are included in either prepaid expenses and other current assets or inventory in the accompanying balance sheets  depending on the nature of the costs and the reason for the deferral 
for sales through resellers and distributors  we recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product only if those resellers and distributors provide us  at the time of placing their order  with the identity of the end user customer to whom the product has been sold 
to the extent that a reseller or distributor requests an inventory or stock of products  we defer revenue on that product until we receive notification that it has been sold through to an identified end user 
changes in our judgments and estimates about these assumptions could materially impact the timing of our revenue recognition 
accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based awards granted include stock options  restricted stock awards  restricted stock units and stock purchased under our amended and restated employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the awards  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we use the black scholes option pricing model for estimating the fair value of stock options granted and for employee stock purchases under our espp 
for a prior award that contained a market condition relating to our stock price achieving specified levels  we used a lattice option pricing model 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term and the expected price volatility 
additionally  the recognition of expense requires the estimation of the number of options that will ultimately vest and the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited 
the fair value of stock based awards is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we rely on historical experience of employee turnover to estimate our expected forfeitures 
average risk free interest rate this is the average us treasury rate  with a term that most closely resembles the expected life of the option  as of the grant date 
expected dividend yield we use an expected dividend yield of zero  as we have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
expected life this is the period of time that the stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and employee purchases under the espp are expected to remain outstanding 
we have elected to use the simplified method of determining the expected term of stock options 
this estimate is derived from the average midpoint between the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term 
in future periods  we expect to begin to incorporate our own data in estimating the expected life as we develop appropriate historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option 
for purchases under the espp  the expected life is the plan period 
expected volatility volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated historical volatility or is expected to fluctuate expected volatility during a period 
given our limited historical stock data from our ipo in march  we have used a blended volatility to estimate expected volatility 
the blended volatility includes a weighting of our historical volatility from the date of our ipo to the respective grant date and an average of our peer group historical volatility consistent with the expected life of the option 
our peer group historical volatility includes the historical volatility of companies that are similar in revenue size  in the same industry or are competitors 
we expect to continue to use a larger proportion of our historical volatility in future periods as we develop additional historical experience of our own stock price fluctuations considered in relation to the expected life of the option 
for purchases under the espp  we use our historical volatility since we have historical data available since our ipo  which is consistent with the expected life 
if we were to employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we were to decide to use a different valuation model  the amount of expense recorded in future periods could differ significantly from what we have recorded in recent periods 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  which are characteristics that are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may be significantly different than the actual values upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency between past and future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods  and assumptions 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carry forwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which primarily consists of net operating loss  or nol  carry forwards  stock based compensation expense and deferred revenue 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of december  and  our deferred tax assets were fully reserved except for foreign deferred tax assets of  and  respectively  expected to be available to offset foreign tax liabilities in the future 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  consists principally of us state and foreign income tax expense 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  consists principally of foreign income tax expense 
if our recent trend of profitability continues  we may determine that there is sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of  or decrease in  the valuation allowance 
if we were to reverse all or some part of our valuation allowance and recognize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would likely record an increase in assets on our consolidated balance sheet in the period of reversal and a corresponding tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for the amount of the reversal 
such amounts could be material to our financial statements 
with respect to foreign earnings  it is our policy to invest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the us with respect to stock based compensation expense  the benefit of the deferred tax asset is being recognized as the related stock options are exercised 
the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options is recorded in additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets to the extent that cash taxes payable are reduced 
we have determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions that would require a reserve as of december  because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations  significant judgment is required 
as a result  we make certain estimates and assumptions in i calculating our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  ii determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and iii evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits  if any  as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain tax positions 
our estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return allowance 
we make estimates regarding the collectability of our accounts receivable 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors  including historical write off experience  the need for specific customer reserves  the aging of our receivables  customer creditworthiness and changes in customer payment cycles 
historically  our allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate based on actual results 
if any of the factors used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts change or if the allowance does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed  and our future results of operations could be materially affected 
as of december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
we also use our judgment to make estimates regarding potential future product returns related to reported product revenue in each period 
we analyze factors such as our historical return experience  current product sales volumes  and changes in product warranty claims when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
if any of the factors used to calculate the sales return allowance were to change  we may experience a material difference in the amount and timing of our product revenue for any given period 
as of december   the sales return allowance was  there was no sales return allowance as of december  inventories 
inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis  or market  except for evaluation and advance replacement units  which are stated at the lower of cost  on a specific identification basis  or market 
evaluation units are used for customer testing and evaluation and are predominantly located at the customers premises 
advance replacement units  which include replacement units and spare parts  are used to provide replacement units under technical support arrangements if a customer s unit is not functioning 
in prior periods  advance replacement units were included in other assets and depreciated using the straight line method 
in the third quarter of  we reclassified these assets to inventory to better reflect the nature of the assets 
we make estimates of forecasted demand for our products  and inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our estimated demand is written down to its estimated net realizable value based on historical usage  expected demand  the timing of new product introductions and age 
it is reasonably possible that our estimate of future demand for our products could change in the near term and result in additional inventory write downs  which would negatively impact our gross margin 
inventory write downs  mostly related to evaluation units and excess and obsolete inventory  are reflected as cost of revenue and amounted to approximately million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investments 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date 
our investments are comprised of money market funds  corporate debt investments  commercial paper  government sponsored enterprise securities  government securities and certificates of deposit 
these investments have been classified as available for sale 
available for sale investments are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity are computed using the effective interest method 
amortization is included in interest and investment income 
interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included in interest and investment income 
we evaluate our investments on a regular basis to determine whether an other than temporary decline in fair value has occurred 
if an investment is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the investment  or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary and is charged against earnings for the period 
for investments that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the investment  but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis  the credit component of the other than temporary impairment is charged against earnings for the applicable period and the non credit component of the other than temporary impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income on our statement of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses entirely caused by non credit related factors related to investments for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance requiring disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments during interim reporting periods 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance related to the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
this guidance amends the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance for determining fair value of an asset or liability when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and for identifying transactions that are not orderly 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance related to subsequent events 
this guidance is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification as the single source of authoritative us gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ended after september  the adoption of this guidance  while it impacts the way we refer to accounting pronouncements in our disclosures  did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb clarified the accounting guidance for sales of tangible products containing both software and hardware elements and issued new guidance that amends the criteria for evaluating the individual items in a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement and how to allocate the consideration received to the individual items 
the guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we believe this literature is applicable to our revenue arrangements 
however  we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk nearly all of our revenue is derived from transactions denominated in us dollars  even though we maintain sales and business operations in foreign countries 
as such  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates  particularly the euro  british pound and japanese yen  associated with operating expenses of  and cash held in  our foreign operations 
however  we believe this exposure is immaterial at this time 
as we grow our international operations  our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling approximately million at december  the cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes while investments  made in accordance with our low risk investment policy  take advantage of higher interest income yields 
in accordance with our investment policy  we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities in which we invest  however  may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short and long term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
due to the nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
credit market risk we invest our cash in accordance with an established internal policy and our investments are comprised of money market funds  corporate debt investments  commercial paper  government sponsored enterprise securities  government securities and certificates of deposit  that historically have been highly liquid and have matured at their full par values 
therefore  we believe our credit market risk to be immaterial at this time 
however  as a result of the recent adverse conditions in the global credit markets  there is a risk that we may incur other than temporary impairment charges with respect to our investments
