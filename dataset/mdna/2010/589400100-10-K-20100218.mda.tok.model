item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents for the years through  the company experienced unfavorable development of approximately million to million on prior accident years losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves 
the unfavorable development from these years relates primarily to increases in loss severity estimates and loss adjustment expense estimates for the california bi coverage as well as increases in the provision for losses in new jersey and florida 
reserves from these years showed further unfavorable development after december  primarily as a result of re estimates of the and accident year loss reserves in new jersey and re estimates of the and accident year loss adjustment expenses reserves in new jersey and california 
for  the unfavorable development relates to an increase in the company s prior accident years loss estimates for personal automobile insurance in florida and new jersey 
in addition  an increase in estimates for loss severity for the accident year reserves for california and new jersey automobile lines of business contributed to the deficiencies 
for  the favorable development largely relates to lower inflation than originally expected on the bi coverage reserves for the california automobile line of insurance 
in addition  the company experienced a reduction in expenditures to outside legal counsel for the defense of personal automobile claims in california 
this led to a reduction in the ultimate expense amount expected to be paid out and therefore favorable development in the reserves at december   partially offset by unfavorable development in the florida and new jersey automobile lines of business 
for years through  the company s previously estimated loss reserves produced deficiencies that were reflected in the subsequent years incurred losses 
the company attributes a large portion of the unfavorable development to increases in the ultimate liability for bi  physical damage  and collision claims over what was originally estimated 
the increases in these losses relate to increased severity over what was originally recorded and are the result of inflationary trends in health care costs  auto parts  and body shop labor costs 
statutory accounting principles the company s results are reported in accordance with gaap  which differ in some respects from amounts reported under sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities 
some of the significant differences under gaap are described below policy acquisition costs such as commissions  premium taxes  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts  are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned  rather than expensed as incurred  as required by sap 
certain assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets whereas  under sap  such assets are designated as nonadmitted assets  and charged directly against statutory surplus 
these assets consist primarily of premium receivables outstanding more than days  deferred tax assets that do not meet statutory requirements for recognition  furniture  equipment  leasehold improvements  capitalized software  and prepaid expenses 
amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverables  rather than netted against unearned premium reserves and losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves  respectively  as required by sap 
fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value rather than at amortized cost  or the lower of amortized cost or fair value  depending on the specific type of security as required by sap 
the differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense 
changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense  rather than recorded directly to statutory surplus as regards policyholders  as required by sap 
admittance testing under sap may result in a charge to unassigned surplus for non admitted 
table of contents portions of deferred tax assets 
under gaap  a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets and reflected as an expense 
certain assessments paid to regulatory agencies that are recoverable from policy holders in future periods are expensed whereas these amounts are recorded as receivables under sap 
operating ratios sap basis loss and expense ratios loss and expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies 
under sap  losses and loss adjustment expenses are stated as a percentage of premiums earned because losses occur over the life of a policy  while underwriting expenses are stated as a percentage of premiums written rather than premiums earned because most underwriting expenses are incurred when policies are written and are not spread over the policy period 
the statutory underwriting profit margin is the extent to which the combined loss and expense ratios are less than 
the insurance companies loss ratio  expense ratio  combined ratio  and the private passenger automobile industry combined ratio  on a statutory basis  are shown in the following table 
the insurance companies ratios include lines of insurance other than private passenger automobile 
since these other lines represent only of premiums written  the company believes its ratios can be compared to the industry ratios included in the following table 
year ended december  loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio industry combined ratio all writers industry combined ratio excluding direct writers n a source am best  aggregates averages through  for all property and casualty insurance companies private passenger automobile line only  after policyholder dividends

widely recognized guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners the naic indicate that this ratio should be no greater than to year ended december  amounts in thousands  except ratios net premiums written policyholders surplus ratio to to to to to investments the company s investments are directed by the chief investment officer under the supervision of the board of directors 
the company s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
the investment strategy has historically focused on maximizing after tax yield with a primary emphasis on maintaining a well diversified  investment grade  fixed income portfolio to support the underlying liabilities and achieve a return on capital and profitable growth 
the company 
table of contents believes that investment yield is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to enhance after tax yield and minimize the potential effect of downgrades and defaults 
the company believes that this strategy maintains the optimal investment performance necessary to sustain investment income over time 
the company s portfolio management approach utilizes a recognized market risk and asset allocation strategy as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive  liquid and credit assets as well as for monitoring credit exposure and diversification requirements 
within the ranges set by the asset allocation strategy  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
tax considerations  including the impact of the alternative minimum tax amt  are important in portfolio management 
changes in loss experience  growth rates  and profitability produce significant changes in the company s exposure to amt liability  requiring appropriate shifts in the investment asset mix between taxable bonds  tax exempt bonds  and equities in order to maximize after tax yield 
the company closely monitors the timing and recognition of capital gains and losses to maximize the realization of any deferred tax assets arising from capital losses 
at december   the company had a capital loss carry forward of approximately million

the nominal average maturity of the overall bond portfolio  including short term bonds  was years at december   which reflects a portfolio heavily weighted in investment grade tax exempt municipal bonds 
fixed maturity investments purchased by the company typically have call options attached  which further 
table of contents reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
the call adjusted average maturity of the overall bond portfolio  including short term bonds  was approximately years  related to holdings which are heavily weighted with high coupon issues that are expected to be called prior to maturity 
the modified duration of the overall bond portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was years at december   including collateralized mortgage obligations with modified durations of approximately years and short term bonds that carry no duration 
modified duration measures the length of time it takes  on average  to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
as it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield  and call terms which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
the longer the duration  the greater the price volatility in relation to changes in interest rates 
equity holdings consist of perpetual preferred stocks and dividend bearing common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax sheltered by the corporate dividend exclusion 
at year end  of short term investments consisted of highly rated short duration securities redeemable on a daily or weekly basis 
the company does not have any material direct equity investment in subprime lenders

competitive conditions the company operates in the highly competitive property casualty industry subject to competition on pricing  claims  consumer recognition  coverage offered and other product features  customer service  and geographic coverage 
some of the company s competitors are larger and well capitalized national companies which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents 
reputation for customer service and price are the principal means by which the company competes with other automobile insurers 
in addition  the marketing efforts of independent agents and brokers can also provide a 
table of contents competitive advantage 
based on the most recent regularly published statistical compilations of premiums written in  the company was the third largest writer of private passenger automobile insurance in california and the thirteenth largest in the united states 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity soft market 
in management s view  through was a period of very profitable results for companies underwriting automobile insurance 
many in the industry have experienced declining profitability since during  many of the company s largest competitors increased rates on both private passenger auto insurance and homeowners insurance 
rate increases generally indicate that the market is hardening 
reinsurance the company has reinsurance through the florida hurricane catastrophe trust fund fhcf that provides coverage equal to approximately percent of million in excess of million per occurrence based on the latest information provided by fhcf 
the coverage is expected to change when new information is available later in for california homeowners policies  the company has reduced its catastrophe exposure from earthquakes by placing earthquake risks with the california earthquake authority cea 
however  the company continues to have catastrophe exposure to fires following an earthquake 
for more detailed discussion  see regulation insurance assessments 
the company carries a commercial umbrella reinsurance treaty and seeks facultative arrangements for large property risks 
in addition  the company has other reinsurance in force that is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
if any reinsurers are unable to perform their obligations under a reinsurance treaty  the company will be required  as primary insurer  to discharge all obligations to its insured in their entirety 
regulation the insurance companies are subject to significant regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to operate business 
department of insurance oversight the powers of the doi in each state primarily include the prior approval of insurance rates and rating factors and the establishment of capital and surplus requirements  solvency standards  restrictions on dividend payments and transactions with affiliates 
doi regulations and supervision are designed principally to benefit policyholders rather than shareholders 
california proposition requires that property and casualty insurance rates be approved by the california doi prior to their use and that no rate be approved which is excessive  inadequate  unfairly discriminatory  or otherwise in violation of the provisions of the initiative 
the proposition specifies four statutory factors required to be applied in decreasing order of importance in determining rates for private passenger automobile insurance the insured s driving safety record  the number of miles the insured drives annually  the number of years of driving experience of the insured and whatever optional factors are determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to risk of loss and are adopted by regulation 
the statute further provides that insurers are required to give at least a discount to good drivers  as defined  from rates that would otherwise be charged to such drivers and that no insurer may refuse to insure a good driver 
the company s rate plan was approved by the california doi and operates under these rating factor regulations 

table of contents insurance rates in georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  and nevada require prior approval from the state doi  while insurance rates in illinois  texas  virginia  arizona  and michigan must only be filed with the respective doi before they are implemented 
oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate  or unfairly discriminatory 
the doi in each state in which the company operates is responsible for conducting periodic financial and market conduct examinations of insurance companies domiciled in their states 
market conduct examinations typically review compliance with insurance statutes and regulations with respect to rating  underwriting  claims handling  billing  and other practices 
the following table provides a summary of current financial and market conduct examinations state exam type period under review status va market conduct jul to jul fieldwork began in january nj market conduct sep to aug report was issued in january ca rating underwriting mar to may preliminary draft was issued in december fl market conduct sep to dec report was issued in june ok financial to report was issued in may during the course of these examinations  the doi generally reports findings to the company  however  none of the findings reported to date is expected to be material to the company s financial position 
for discussion of current regulatory matters in california  see regulatory and legal matters in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the operations of the company are dependent on the laws of the states in which it does business and changes in those laws can materially affect the revenue and expenses of the company 
the company retains its own legislative advocates in california 
the company made financial contributions of  and  to officeholders and candidates in and  respectively 
the company believes in supporting the political process and intends to continue to make such contributions in amounts which it determines to be appropriate 
the company is supporting the continuous coverage auto insurance discount act ccaida  a california ballot initiative which will be on the june ballot 
if passed  the ccaida will provide for a portable persistency discount  allowing insurance companies to offer new customers discounts based on having continuous insurance coverage from any insurance company 
currently  the california doi allows insurance companies to provide persistency discounts based on continuous coverage only with existing customers 
while the company strongly believes this will be beneficial for the insurance consumer  there are consumer activist groups both supporting and opposing the initiative 
the company made financial contributions of million in related to this initiative 
risk based capital the insurance companies must comply with minimum capital requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
the minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premiums  a percentage of annualized loss  or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the naic 
the rbc formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements  and a number of other factors 
at december   each of the insurance companies had sufficient capital to exceed the highest level of minimum required capital 

table of contents insurance assessments the california insurance guarantee association ciga was created to pay claims on behalf of insolvent property and casualty insurers 
each year  these claims are estimated by ciga and the company is assessed for its pro rata share based on prior year california premiums written in the particular line 
these assessments are limited to of premiums written in the preceding year and are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders in the year after the assessment 
there were no ciga assessments in during  the company paid approximately million in assessments to the new jersey unsatisfied claim and judgment fund and the new jersey property liability insurance guaranty association for assessments relating to its personal automobile line of insurance 
as permitted by state law  the new jersey assessments paid during are recoupable through a surcharge to policyholders 
during  the company continued to recoup these assessments and will continue recouping them in the future 
it is possible that there will be additional assessments in under gaap  these recoverable assessments of million have been expensed as other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the cea is a quasi governmental organization that was established to provide a market for earthquake coverage to california homeowners 
the company places all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowner policy through the cea 
the company receives a small fee for placing business with the cea  which is recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
upon the occurrence of a major seismic event  the cea has the ability to assess participating companies for losses 
these assessments are made after cea capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment 
based upon the most recent information provided by the cea  the company s maximum total exposure to cea assessments at april   the most recent date at which information was available  was approximately million 
the insurance companies in other states are also subject to the provisions of similar insurance guaranty associations 
there were no material assessment payments during in other states 
holding company act the california companies are subject to california doi regulation pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
the california doi may examine the affairs of each of the california companies at any time 
the holding company act requires disclosure of any material transactions among affiliates within a holding company system 
certain transactions and dividends defined to be of an extraordinary type may not be affected if the california doi disapproves the transaction within days after notice 
such transactions include  but are not limited to  extraordinary dividends  management agreements  service contracts  and cost sharing arrangements  all guarantees that are not quantifiable  derivative transactions or series of derivative transactions  certain reinsurance transactions or modifications thereof in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer s liabilities equals or exceeds percent of the policyholders surplus as of the preceding december  sales  purchases  exchanges  loans  and extensions of credit  and investments  in the net aggregate  involving more than the lesser of of the respective california companies admitted assets or of statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding december an extraordinary dividend is a dividend which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s statutory policyholders surplus as of the preceding december or the insurance company s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year 
an insurance company is also required to notify the california doi of any dividend after declaration  but prior to payment 
there are similar limitations imposed by other states on the insurance companies ability to pay dividends 
as of december   the insurance companies are permitted to pay  without extraordinary doi approval  million in dividends  of which million is payable from the california companies 

table of contents the holding company act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a california domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the california doi 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities  which in the aggregate constitute or more of the voting securities of a california insurance company or of a person that controls a california insurance company  such as mercury general 
a person seeking to acquire control  directly or indirectly  of the company must generally file with the california doi an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the company 
the holding company act also effectively restricts the company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval 
each of the insurance companies is subject to holding company regulations in the state in which it is domiciled 
these provisions are substantially similar to those of the holding company act 
assigned risks automobile liability insurers in california are required to sell bi liability  property damage liability  medical expense  and uninsured motorist coverage to a proportionate number based on the insurer s share of the california automobile casualty insurance market of those drivers applying for placement as assigned risks 
drivers seek placement as assigned risks because their driving records or other relevant characteristics  as defined by proposition  make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market 
in  assigned risks represented less than of total automobile direct premiums written and less than of total automobile direct premium earned 
the company attributes the low level of assignments to the competitive voluntary market 
many of the other states in which the company conducts business offer programs similar to that of california 
these programs are not a significant contributor to the business written in those states

table of contents item a 
risk factors the company s business involves various risks and uncertainties in addition to the normal risks of business  some of which are discussed in this section 
it should be noted that the company s business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond the company s control 
in addition  other risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the company s business 
if any such risks or uncertainties  or any of the following risks or uncertainties  develop into actual events  there could be a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
the information discussed below should be considered carefully with the other information contained in this annual report on form k and the other documents and materials filed by the company with the sec  as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the company from time to time 
risks related to the company s business the company remains highly dependent upon california and several other key states to produce revenues and operating profits 
for the year ended december   the company generated approximately of its direct automobile insurance premiums written in california  in florida  and in new jersey 
the company s financial results are subject to prevailing regulatory  legal  economic  demographic  competitive  and other conditions in these states and changes in any of these conditions could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
mercury general is a holding company that relies on regulated subsidiaries for cash operating profits to satisfy its obligations 
as a holding company  mercury general maintains no operations that generate revenue sufficient to pay operating expenses  shareholders dividends  or principal or interest on its indebtedness 
consequently  mercury general relies on the ability of the insurance companies  particularly the california companies  to pay dividends for mercury general to meet its debt payment and other obligations 
the ability of the insurance companies to pay dividends is regulated by state insurance laws  which limit the amount of  and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of  cash dividends 
generally  these insurance regulations permit the payment of dividends only out of earned surplus in any year which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  do not exceed the greater of of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year or the net income for the preceding year  with larger dividends payable only after receipt of prior regulatory approval 
the inability of the insurance companies to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable the company to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition  and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements  and any failure to meet these requirements could subject the company s insurance subsidiaries to regulatory action 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable laws of their state of domicile 
the risk based capital standards  based upon the risk based capital model act adopted by the naic  require the company s insurance subsidiaries to report their results of rbc calculations to state departments of insurance and the naic 
if any of the company s insurance subsidiaries fails to meet these standards and requirements  the doi regulating such subsidiary may require specified actions by the subsidiary 

table of contents the company s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders 
the company s financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations depend on its ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it assumes 
premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses  and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
in order to price its products accurately  the company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data  develop  test  and apply appropriate rating formulae  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy 
the company s ability to undertake these efforts successfully  and as a result  price accurately  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to availability of sufficient reliable data  incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data  uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions  generally  selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  successful innovation of new pricing strategies  recognition of changes in trends and in the projected severity and frequency of losses  the company s ability to forecast renewals of existing policies accurately  unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action  ongoing changes in the company s claim settlement practices  changes in operating expenses  changing driving patterns  extra contractual liability arising from bad faith claims  weather catastrophes  unexpected medical inflation  and unanticipated inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices  and used car prices 
such risks may result in the company s pricing being based on outdated  inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses  assumptions or methodologies  and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims 
as a result  the company could underprice risks  which would negatively affect the company s margins  or it could overprice risks  which could reduce the company s volume and competitiveness 
in either event  the company s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the company s business are uncertain and may have an adverse effect on the company s business 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social  and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect the company s business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until sometime after the company has issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under the company s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued 

table of contents the company s insurance rates are subject to prior approval by the departments of insurance in most of the states in which the company operates  and to political influences 
in most of the states in which the company operates  it must obtain prior approval from the state department of insurance of insurance rates charged to its customers  including any increases in those rates 
if the company is unable to receive approval of the rate increases it requests  the company s ability to operate its business in a profitable manner may be limited and its liquidity  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
from time to time  the auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators  and special interest groups to reduce  freeze  or set rates at levels that do not correspond with underlying costs  in the opinion of the company s management 
the homeowners insurance business faces similar pressure  particularly as regulators in catastrophe prone states seek an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
in addition  various insurance underwriting and pricing criteria regularly come under attack by regulators  legislators  and special interest groups 
the result could be legislation  regulations  or new interpretations of existing regulations that would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if the company cannot maintain its am best ratings  it may not be able to maintain premium volume in its insurance operations sufficient to attain the company s financial performance goals 
the company s ability to retain its existing business or to attract new business in its insurance operations is affected by its rating by am best company 
am best company currently rates all of the company s insurance subsidiaries with sufficient operating history to be rated as either a superior or a excellent 
if the company is unable to maintain its am best ratings  the company may not be able to grow its premium volume sufficiently to attain its financial performance goals  and if am best were to downgrade the company s ratings  the result may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s long term debt obligations begin to mature in august the company may be unable to refinance the obligations or obtain sufficient capital to repay the obligations on acceptable terms  or at all 
the company has an aggregate of million in the following long term debt obligations million senior notes  which mature in august  million secured credit facility  which matures in january  incurred in connection with the ais acquisition  and million secured bank loan  which matures in  incurred in connection with the folsom  california building acquisition 
the company s ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control  and the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to repay the debt at maturity 
the company s ability to repay or refinance its long term debt at maturity also creates financial risk  particularly if the company s business or prevailing financial market conditions are not conducive to refinancing the outstanding debt obligations or obtaining new financing 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the debt obligations at maturity or to refinance the obligations on commercially reasonable terms  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations may be harmed 
the company s ability to access capital markets  its financing arrangements  and its business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 
financial strength and claims paying ability ratings issued by firms such as standard poor s  fitch  and moody s have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
the company s ability to attract and retain policies is affected by its ratings with these agencies 

table of contents rating agencies assign ratings based upon their evaluations of an insurance company s ability to meet its financial obligations 
the company s financial strength ratings with standard poor s  fitch  and moody s are aa  aa  and aa  respectively  its respective debt ratings are a  a  and a in  the ratings were affirmed by standard poor s  fitch  and moody s  but the outlook for the ratings was changed from stable to negative 
since these ratings are subject to continuous review  the company cannot guarantee the continuation of the favorable ratings 
if the ratings were lowered significantly by any one of these agencies relative to those of the company s competitors  its ability to market products to new customers and to renew the policies of current customers could be harmed 
a lowering of the ratings could also limit the company s access to the capital markets or adversely affect pricing of new debt sought in the capital markets 
these events  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and liquidity 
changes in market interest rates or defaults may have an adverse effect on the company s investment portfolio  which may adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s results are affected  in part  by the performance of its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive investments  such as municipal and corporate bonds 
increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of the investment portfolio by decreasing realized capital gains on fixed income securities 
declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on the company s investment income as it invests positive cash flows from operations and as it reinvests proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could yield lower rates than the company s investments have historically generated 
defaults in the company s investment portfolio may produce operating losses and negatively impact the company s results of operations 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the company s control 
although the company takes measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  it may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
the company s mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio and managing the duration of the portfolio to reduce the effect of interest rate changes 
despite its mitigation efforts  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s valuation of financial instruments may include methodologies  estimations  and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to valuations that may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
accordingly  when market observable data is not readily available  the company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would be presumed to use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value are categorized based on the level of judgment associated with the input used to measure their fair value and the level of market price observability 
during periods of market disruption  including periods of significantly changing interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads  inactivity or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of the company s securities if trading becomes less frequent and or market data becomes less observable 
there may be certain asset classes in historically active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to changes in the financial environment 
in such cases  the valuations associated with such securities may rely more on management judgment and include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods  which are more sophisticated or require greater estimation 
the valuations generated by such methods may be different from the value at which the investments ultimately may be sold 
further  rapidly 
table of contents changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within the company s financial statements  and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the financial strength ratings of financial guaranty insurers issuing policies on bonds held in the company s investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on the company s investment results 
in an effort to enhance the bond rating applicable to certain bond issues  some bond issuers purchase municipal bond insurance policies from private insurers 
the insurance generally guarantees the payment of principal and interest on a bond issue if the issuer defaults 
by purchasing the insurance  the financial strength ratings applicable to the bonds are based on the credit worthiness of the insurer rather than the underlying credit of the bond issuer 
several financial guaranty insurers that have issued insurance policies covering bonds held by the company are facing financial strength rating downgrades due to risk exposures on insurance policies that guarantee mortgage debt and related structured products 
these financial guaranty insurers are subject to doi oversight 
as the financial strength ratings of these insurers are reduced  the ratings of the insured bond issues correspondingly decrease 
although the company has determined that the financial strength rating of the underlying bond issues in its investment portfolio are within the company s investment policy without the enhancement provided by the insurance policies  any further downgrades in the financial strength ratings of these insurance companies or any defaults on the insurance policies written by these insurance companies may reduce the fair value of the underlying bond issues and the company s investment portfolio or may reduce the investment results generated by the company s investment portfolio  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
deterioration of the municipal bond market in general or of specific municipal bonds held by the company may result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and its financial condition 
at december   approximately of the company s total investment portfolio at fair value and of its total fixed maturity investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt municipal bonds 
approximately of the net realized gain held in the company s investment portfolio at december  related to the company s municipal bond holdings 
with such a large percentage of the company s investment portfolio invested in municipal bonds  the performance of the company s investment portfolio  including the cash flows generated by the investment portfolio is significantly dependent on the performance of municipal bonds 
if the value of municipal bond markets in general or any of the company s municipal bond holdings deteriorate  the performance of the company s investment portfolio  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 
acquired companies can be difficult to integrate  disrupt the company s business and adversely affect its operating results 
the benefits anticipated in an acquisition may not be realized in the manner anticipated 
effective january   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of aism  which is the parent company of ais and poliseek  with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits including  enhanced revenue and profits  greater market presence and development  and enhancements to the company s product portfolio and customer base 
these benefits may not be realized as rapidly as  or to the extent  anticipated by the company 
costs incurred in the integration of the ais operations with the company s operations also could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and operating results 
the acquisition of ais  as with all acquisitions  involves numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating ais operations  technologies  services and personnel  potential loss of ais customers  diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations  potential loss of key ais employees  
table of contents integrating personnel with diverse business and cultural backgrounds  preserving ais important industry  marketing and customer relationships  assumption of liabilities held by ais  and inability to generate sufficient revenue and cost savings to offset the cost of the acquisition 
the company s acquisition of ais may also cause it to assume and otherwise become subject to certain liabilities  incur additional debt to finance operations  incur write offs  restructuring  and other related expenses  and have significant impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets 
if these risks materialize  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and stock price could be materially adversely affected 
if the company s loss reserves are inadequate  its business and financial position could be harmed 
the process of establishing property and liability loss reserves is inherently uncertain due to a number of factors  including underwriting quality  the frequency and amount of covered losses  variations in claims settlement practices  the costs and uncertainty of litigation  and expanding theories of liability 
while the company believes that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating loss reserves  the company s methods may prove to be inadequate 
if any of these contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control  results in loss reserves that are not sufficient to cover its actual losses  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
there is uncertainty involved in the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverable 
the company reinsures a portion of its potential losses on the policies it issues to mitigate the volatility of the losses on its financial condition and results of operations 
the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions  which are outside of the company s control 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases prevented  insurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
as a result  the company may not be able to successfully purchase reinsurance and transfer a portion of the company s risk through reinsurance arrangements 
in addition  as is customary  the company initially pays all claims and seeks to recover the reinsured losses from its reinsurers 
although the company reports as assets the amount of claims paid which the company expects to recover from reinsurers  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to collect from its reinsurers 
if the amounts actually recoverable under the company s reinsurance treaties are ultimately determined to be less than the amount it has reported as recoverable  the company may incur a loss during the period in which that determination is made 
in addition  am best  credit rating agency  has expressed a concern regarding the fhcf s ability to fund all obligations in the case of a severe hurricane 
based on its projected claims paying capacity  coverage provided by the fhcf s mandatory layer will be reduced  and given the lack of funding regarding the temporary increase in coverage limits  no credit will be provided for this layer 
am best will continue to assess the amount of credit afforded to reinsurance from the fhcf related to events of the hurricane season  as well as credit market conditions  and such assessment is subject to change since this ongoing evaluation is critical in the assignment of ratings 

table of contents the failure of any of the loss limitation methods employed by the company could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
various provisions of the company s policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which are intended to limit the company s risks  may not be enforceable in the manner the company intends 
in addition  the company s policies contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims and the company s right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition 
while the company s insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the company s loss exposure and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks  it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect the company s loss experience  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company s business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss  which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
the company faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events  particularly hurricanes  earthquakes  hail storms  explosions  tropical storms  fires  sinkholes  war  acts of terrorism  severe winter weather and other natural and man made disasters 
such events typically increase the frequency and severity of automobile and other property claims 
because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable  historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations  and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in the company s financial condition and results of operations from period to period 
although the company attempts to manage its exposure to such events  the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could have a material and adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations and could result in substantial outflows of cash as losses are paid 
the company depends on independent agents and brokers who may discontinue sales of its policies at any time 
the company sells its insurance policies through approximately  independent agents and brokers 
the company must compete with other insurance carriers for these agents and brokers business 
some competitors offer a larger variety of products  lower prices for insurance coverage  higher commissions  or more attractive non cash incentives 
to maintain its relationship with these independent agents  the company must pay competitive commissions  be able to respond to their needs quickly and adequately  and create a consistently high level of customer satisfaction 
if these independent agents find it preferable to do business with the company s competitors  it would be difficult to renew the company s existing business or attract new business 
state regulations may also limit the manner in which the company s producers are compensated or incentivized 
such developments could negatively impact the company s relationship with these parties and ultimately reduce revenues 
the company s expansion plans may adversely affect its future profitability 
the company is currently expanding and intends to further expand its operations in several of the states in which the company has operations and into states in which it has not yet begun operations 
the intended expansion will necessitate increased expenditures 
the company expects to fund these expenditures out of cash flow from operations 
the expansion may not occur  or if it does occur may not be successful in providing increased revenues or profitability 
if the company s cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover the increased costs of the expansion  or if the expansion does not provide the benefits anticipated  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and ability to grow its business may be harmed 

table of contents the company may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
the company s future capital requirements depend on many factors  including its ability to write new business successfully  its ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses  the success of its current expansion plans and the performance of its investment portfolio 
the company may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing  sales of all or a portion of its investment portfolio or curtail its growth and reduce its assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may not be available on terms that are favorable to the company 
in the case of equity financing  the company s shareholders could experience dilution 
in addition  such securities may have rights  preferences  and privileges that are senior to those of the company s current shareholders 
if the company cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  its business  results of operations  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
funding for the company s future growth may depend upon obtaining new financing  which may be difficult to obtain given prevalent economic conditions 
to accommodate the company s expected future growth  the company may require funding in addition to cash provided from current operations 
the company s ability to obtain financing may be constrained by current economic conditions affecting global financial markets 
specifically  with the recent trends affecting the banking industry  many lenders and institutional investors have ceased funding even the most credit worthy borrowers 
if the company is unable to obtain necessary financing  it may be unable to take advantage of opportunities with potential business partners or new products or to otherwise expand its business as planned 
any inability of the company to realize its deferred tax assets may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for tax credits 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on available evidence  including assumptions about future profitability and capital gain generation 
although management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  some or all of the company s deferred tax assets could expire unused if the company is unable to generate taxable capital gains in the future sufficient to utilize them or the company enters into one or more transactions that limit its right to realize all of the deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce the deferred tax asset through a charge to earnings in the period in which the determination is made 
this charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the assumptions used to make this determination are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between the company s future projected operating performance and actual results 
as a result  significant management judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
for these reasons and because changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the company s results of operations and financial condition  management has included the assessment of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a critical accounting estimate 
the carrying value of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets could be subject to an impairment write down 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet reflected million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that suggest that the fair value of its other intangible assets are below their respective carrying values 
the determination that the fair value of the company s intangible assets is less than its carrying value may result 
table of contents in an impairment write down 
the impairment write down would be reflected as expense and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations during the period in which it recognizes the expense 
in the future  the company may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets already recorded or arising out of future acquisitions 
the company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business  and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company depends on the accuracy  reliability  and proper functioning of its information technology systems 
the company relies on these information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business  including underwriting  policy acquisition  claims processing and handling  accounting  reserving and actuarial processes and policies  and to maintain its policyholder data 
the company is developing and deploying new information technology systems that are designed to manage many of these functions across all of the states in which it operates and all of the lines of insurance it offers 
see overview technology in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the failure of hardware or software that supports the company s information technology systems  the loss of data contained in the systems  or any delay or failure in the full deployment of the company s new information technology systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums  increased overhead costs  and inaccurate reporting  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  despite system redundancy  the implementation of security measures  and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the company s information technology systems  these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers  power loss  unauthorized access  and computer systems  internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
it is possible that a system failure  accident  or security breach could result in a material disruption to the company s business 
in addition  substantial costs may be incurred to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 
following implementation of its new information technology systems  the company may from time to time install new or upgraded business management systems 
to the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner  the company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  the company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb 
it is possible that future changes the company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the company may be required to adopt international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the ultimate adoption of such standards could negatively impact its financial condition or results of operations 
although not yet required  the company could be required to adopt ifrs  which differs from gaap  for the company s accounting and reporting standards 
the ultimate implementation and adoption of new standards could favorably or unfavorably impact the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect acts of fraud 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
the company s management  including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer  believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  the company cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and the company cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec require the company to include in its form k a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
areas of the company s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time 
if management is unable to assert that the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if the company s independent auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls  investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the company s financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on its stock price 
the ability of the company to attract  develop and retain talented employees  managers and executives  and to maintain appropriate staffing levels  is critical to the company s success 
as the company expands its operations  it hires and trains new employees and retains current employees to handle the resulting increase in new inquiries  policies  customers  and claims 
the failure to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled employees could result in the company having to slow the growth of its business 
in addition  the failure of adequate staffing of claims and underwriting departments could result in decreased quality of the company s operations 
the company s success also depends upon the continued contributions of its executive officers  both individually and as a group 
the company s future performance will be substantially dependent on its ability to 
table of contents retain and motivate its management team 
the loss of the services of any of the company s executive officers could prevent the company from successfully implementing its business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
continuing negative economic conditions may negatively affect the company s business and operating results 
continuing negative economic conditions could adversely affect the company in the form of consumer behavior and pressure on its investment portfolio 
consumer behavior could include policy cancellations  modifications  or non renewals  which may reduce cash flows from operations and investments  may harm the company s financial position  and may reduce the insurance companies statutory surplus 
challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of the company s customers to pay premiums as they fall due  and as a result  the company s bad debt reserves and write offs could increase 
it is also possible that claims fraud may increase 
the company s investment portfolios could be adversely affected as a result of deteriorating financial and business conditions affecting the issuers of the securities in the company s investment portfolio 
in addition  declines in the company s profitability could result in a charge to earnings for the impairment of goodwill  which would not affect the company s cash flow but could decrease its earnings  and its stock price could be adversely affected 
many economists believe that the severe economic recession is over but they expect the recovery to be slow with many businesses feeling the effects of the downturn for years to come 
the company is unable to predict the duration and severity of the current disruption in the financial markets in the united states  and in california  where the majority of the company s business is produced 
if economic conditions continue to deteriorate or do not show significant improvement  the adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows may continue 
the presence of defective chinese made drywall in homes subject to our homeowner policies may lead to additional losses and expenses 
some homeowners in southern florida have experienced unpleasant odors and unusual air conditioning problems  which have been linked to the use of defective chinese made drywall 
it is difficult to accurately estimate any covered losses that may develop as a result of these problems 
however  if and to the extent the scope of the chinese made drywall problems proves to be significant  the company could incur costs or liabilities related to this issue that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
risks related to the company s industry the private passenger automobile insurance industry is highly competitive  and the company may not be able to compete effectively against larger  better capitalized companies 
the company competes with many property and casualty insurance companies selling private passenger automobile insurance in the states in which the company operates 
many of these competitors are better capitalized than the company and have higher am best ratings 
the superior capitalization of the competitors may enable them to offer lower rates  to withstand larger losses  and to more effectively take advantage of new marketing opportunities 
the company s competition may also become increasingly better capitalized in the future as the traditional barriers between insurance companies and banks and other financial institutions erode and as the property and casualty industry continues to consolidate 
the company s ability to compete against these larger  better capitalized competitors depends on its ability to deliver superior service and its strong relationships with independent agents 
the company may undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve its competitive position and drive growth 
if the company is unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if the 
table of contents company s marketing campaigns do not attract new customers  the company s competitive position may be harmed  which could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
additionally  in the event of a failure of any competitor  the company and other insurance companies would likely be required by state law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and would be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer s former policyholders 
the company may be adversely affected by changes in the private passenger automobile insurance industry 
approximately of the company s direct written premiums for the year ended december  were generated from private passenger automobile insurance policies 
adverse developments in the market for personal automobile insurance or the personal automobile insurance industry in general  whether related to changes in competition  pricing or regulations  could cause the company s results of operations to suffer 
the property casualty insurance industry is also exposed to the risks of severe weather conditions  such as rainstorms  snowstorms  hail and ice storms  hurricanes  tornadoes  wild fires  sinkholes  earthquakes and  to a lesser degree  explosions  terrorist attacks and riots 
the automobile insurance business is also affected by cost trends that impact profitability 
factors which negatively affect cost trends include inflation in automobile repair costs  automobile parts costs  used car prices  and medical care 
the insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation  which may affect the company s ability to execute its business plan and grow its business 
the company is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of the states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  as well as in the states where its insurance subsidiaries sell insurance products  issue policies  and handle claims 
some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions  which may adversely affect the company s ability to operate  innovate  obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow its business profitably 
these regulations provide safeguards for policyholders and are not intended to protect the interests of shareholders 
the company s ability to comply with these laws and regulations  and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner  is and will continue to be  critical to its success 
some of these regulations include required licensing 
the company operates under licenses issued by the doi in the states in which the company sells insurance 
if a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license  the company s ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired 
also  if the doi in any state in which the company currently operates suspends  non renews  or revokes an existing license  the company would not be able to offer affected products in the state 
transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates 
transactions between the insurance companies and their affiliates including the company generally must be disclosed to state regulators  and prior approval of the applicable regulator is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated 
state regulators may refuse to approve or delay approval of some transactions  which may adversely affect the company s ability to innovate or operate efficiently 
regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms 
the insurance laws of most states in which the company conducts business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval 
if  as permitted in some states  the company begins using new rates before they are approved  it may be required to issue refunds or credits to the company s policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable state regulator 
accordingly  the company s ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state can be adversely affected 
restrictions on cancellation  non renewal or withdrawal 
most of the states in which the company operates have laws and regulations that limit its ability to exit a market 
for example  these states may limit a private passenger auto insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies or they may prohibit the company from 
table of contents withdrawing one or more lines of insurance business from the state unless prior approval is received from the state insurance department 
in some states  these regulations extend to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written  not just to a complete withdrawal 
laws and regulations that limit the company s ability to cancel and non renew policies in some states or locations and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict the company s ability to exit unprofitable markets  which may harm its business and results of operations 
other regulations 
the company must also comply with regulations involving  among other matters the use of non public consumer information and related privacy issues  the use of credit history in underwriting and rating  limitations on the ability to charge policy fees  limitations on types and amounts of investments  the payment of dividends  the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  involuntary assignments of high risk policies  participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations  assessments and other governmental charges  reporting with respect to financial condition  periodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners  and the other regulations discussed in this annual report on form k 
the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in actions by regulators  fines and penalties  and in extreme cases  revocation of the company s ability to do business in that jurisdiction 
in addition  the company may face individual and class action lawsuits by insured and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 
in addition  from time to time  the company may support or oppose legislation or other amendments to insurance regulations in california or other states in which it operates 
consequently  the company may receive negative publicity related to its support or opposition of legislative or regulatory changes that may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
currently  the company is supporting the ccaida 
see item business regulation department of insurance oversight for further details 
regulation may become more extensive in the future  which may adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that states will not make existing insurance related laws and regulations more restrictive in the future or enact new restrictive laws 
new or more restrictive regulation in any state in which the company conducts business could make it more expensive for it to continue to conduct business in these states  restrict the premiums the company is able to charge or otherwise change the way the company does business 
in such events  the company may seek to reduce its writings in or to withdraw entirely from these states 
in addition  from time to time  the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 
the company cannot predict whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect its business will be adopted  the timing of any such adoption and what effects  if any  they may have on the company s results of operations  profitability  and financial condition 

table of contents assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds  second injury funds  catastrophe funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce the company s profitability 
virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insured parties as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
many states also have laws that established second injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury which are funded by either assessments based on paid losses or premium surcharge mechanisms 
in addition  as a condition to the ability to conduct business in various states  the insurance subsidiaries must participate in mandatory property and casualty shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements  which provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers 
the effect of these assessments and mandatory shared market mechanisms or changes in them could reduce the company s profitability in any given period or limit its ability to grow its business 
the insurance industry faces risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  insurance companies incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and their results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if they fail to accurately project litigation expenses 
insurance companies are subject to a variety of legal actions including employee benefit claims  wage and hour claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  and fraud and misrepresentation claims 
in addition  insurance companies incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims related to the insurance industry in general and the company s business in particular  such as claims by policyholders alleging failure to pay for  termination or non renewal of coverage  sales practices  claims related to reinsurance matters  and other matters 
such actions can also include allegations of fraud  misrepresentation  and unfair or improper business practices and can include claims for punitive damages 
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase exposures for any of the types of claims insurance companies face 
there is a risk that insurance companies could incur substantial legal fees and expenses  including discovery expenses  in any of the actions companies defend in excess of amounts budgeted for defense 
the company and its insurance subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits 
these lawsuits are described more fully at overview b 
regulatory and legal matters in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation  by its very nature  is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain 
the precise nature of the relief that may be sought or granted in any lawsuits is uncertain and may negatively impact the manner in which the company conducts its business and results of operations  which could materially increase the company s legal expenses 
in addition  potential litigation involving new claim  coverage  and business practice issues could adversely affect the company s business by changing the way policies are priced  extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent  or increasing the size of claims 
loss or significant restriction of the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of personal lines products could reduce the company s future profitability 
the company uses credit scoring as a factor in pricing decisions where allowed by state law 
some consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against some groups of people and are calling for the prohibition or restriction on the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing 
laws or regulations that significantly curtail the use of credit scoring  if enacted in a large number of states  could impact the company s future results of operations 

table of contents risks related to the company s stock the company is controlled by small number of shareholders who will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including change of control transactions 
george joseph and gloria joseph collectively own more than of the company s common stock 
accordingly  george joseph and gloria joseph have the ability to exert significant influence on the actions the company may take in the future  including change of control transactions 
this concentration of ownership may conflict with the interests of the company s other shareholders and the holders of its debt securities 
future sales of common stock may affect the market price of the company s common stock and the future exercise of options and warrants will result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
the company may raise capital in the future through the issuance and sale of shares of its common stock 
the company cannot predict what effect  if any  such future sales will have on the market price of its common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of its common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the company s outstanding common stock  and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell common stock at a time and price that the shareholder deems appropriate 
in addition  the company has issued options to purchase shares of its common stock 
in the event that any options to purchase common stock are exercised  shareholders will suffer dilution in their investment 
applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of the company or the sale of any of its insurance subsidiaries 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company or any holding company of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the doi of the state where the insurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of the insurer or holding company  the state doi will consider a number of factors relating to the acquirer and the transaction 
these laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company or the sale by the company of any of its insurance subsidiaries  including transactions that some or all of the company s shareholders might consider to be desirable 
although the company has consistently paid cash dividends in the past  it may not be able to pay cash dividends in the future 
the company has paid cash dividends on a consistent basis since the public offering of its common stock in november however  future cash dividends will depend upon a variety of factors  including the company s profitability  financial condition  capital needs  future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
the company s ability to pay dividends may also be limited by the ability of the insurance companies to make distributions to the company  which may be restricted by financial  regulatory or tax constraints  and by the terms of the company s debt instruments 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial and regulatory conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution

general the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant quarter to quarter and year to year fluctuations due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates  changes in fair value of investments  and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the company is headquartered in los angeles  california and operates primarily as a personal automobile insurer selling policies through a network of independent agents and brokers in thirteen states 
the company also offers homeowners  mechanical breakdown  fire  umbrella  and commercial automobile and property insurance 
private passenger automobile lines of insurance accounted for approximately of the billion of the company s direct premiums written in approximately of the private passenger automobile premiums were written in california 
the company operates primarily in the state of california  the only state in which it operated prior to the company has since expanded its operations into the following states georgia and illinois  oklahoma and texas  florida  virginia and new york  new jersey  and arizona  pennsylvania  michigan  and nevada 
the company expects to continue its growth by expanding into new states in future years with the objective of achieving greater geographic diversification 
there are challenges and risks involved in entering each new state  including establishing adequate rates without any operating history in the state  working with a new regulatory regime  hiring and training competent personnel  building adequate systems  and finding qualified agents to represent the company 
the company does not expect to enter into any new states during this section discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the company s performance  prospects  and risks 
it is not all inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of management s discussion and analysis  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and all other items contained within this annual report on form k

the company believes that its marketing efforts  combined with its ability to maintain relatively low prices and a strong reputation  make the company very competitive in california and in other states 
the company believes that it has a thorough underwriting process that gives the company an advantage over its competitors 
the company views its agent relationships and underwriting process as one of its primary competitive advantages because it allows the company to charge lower rates yet realize better margins than many competitors 

table of contents effective january   the company acquired ais with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits including enhanced revenue and profits  greater market presence and development  and enhancements to the company s product portfolio and customer base 
in  the ais operations were fully integrated into the company 
the company s operating results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations  which was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
cash flow from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends and to help support growth 
economic and industry wide factors regulatory uncertainty the insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates 
state regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including  in some states  approving rate changes and rating factors  and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements 
in many states  insurance commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners 
the company has a successful track record of working with difficult regulations and new insurance commissioners 
however  there is no certainty that current or future regulations and the interpretation of those regulations by insurance commissioners and the courts will not have an adverse impact on the company 
cost uncertainty because insurance companies pay claims after premiums are collected  the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known until well after the policy revenues are earned 
consequently  significant assumptions are made when establishing insurance rates and loss reserves 
while insurance companies use sophisticated models and experienced actuaries to assist in setting rates and establishing loss reserves  there can be no assurance that current rates or current reserve estimates will be adequate 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will approve rate increases when the company s actuarial analysis shows that they are needed 
market volatility in and early  the prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies  and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions  resulted in significant fluctuations in the company s investment portfolio 
while many economists believe that the severe economic recession is over  they expect the recovery to be slow with many businesses feeling the effects of the downturn for years to come 
the company is unable to predict the duration and severity of the current disruption in the financial markets in the united states 
as a result  depending on market conditions  the company may incur substantial additional losses in future periods  which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations  equity  business and insurer financial strength  and debt ratings 
inflation the largest cost component for automobile insurers is losses  which include medical costs  replacement automobile parts  and labor costs 
there can be significant variation in the overall increases in medical cost inflation  and it is often a year or more after the respective fiscal period ends before sufficient claims have closed for the inflation rate to be known with a reasonable degree of certainty 
therefore  it can be difficult to establish reserves and set premium rates  particularly when actual inflation rates may be higher or lower than anticipated 
loss frequency another component of overall loss costs is loss frequency  which is the number of claims per risk insured 
there has been a long term trend of declining loss frequency in the personal automobile insurance industry  but the company is unable to predict the trend of loss frequency in the future 
underwriting cycle and competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with alternating hard and soft market conditions 
the company has historically seen premium growth in excess of during hard markets 
premium growth rates in soft markets have been from slightly 
table of contents positive to negative and were negative in in management s view  through was a period of very profitable results for companies underwriting automobile insurance 
many in the industry have experienced declining profitability since during  many of the company s largest competitors have increased rates on both private passenger auto insurance and homeowners insurance 
rate increases generally indicate that the market is hardening 
technology in  the company continued the implementation of its internet agency portal  mercury first  which is now in use in new york  virginia  and florida 
the company plans to roll out mercury first to the remaining states in which it operates with private passenger auto in and several states with homeowners and commercial auto in mercury first is a single entry point for agents providing a broad suite of capabilities 
one of its most powerful tools is a point of sale pos system that allows agents to easily obtain and compare quotes and write new business 
mercury first is also an easy to use agency portal that provides a customized work queue for each agency user showing new business leads  underwriting requests and other pertinent customer information in real time 
agents can also assist customers with processing payments  reporting claims or updating their records 
the system enables quick access to documents and forms and empowers the agents with several self service capabilities 
additional pos solutions for commercial auto and homeowners lines are planned to be in use in the company has developed a nextgen computer system to replace its legacy underwriting  billings  claims and commissions systems for private passenger auto 
the nextgen system was designed to be a multi state  multi line system to enable the company to enter new states more rapidly  as well as to improve response times to legislative and regulatory changes 
the company has completed the rollout of nextgen for all underwriting  billing  claims  and commission functions supporting the private passenger auto line in seven states virginia  new york  florida  california  georgia  illinois  and texas  and expects that nextgen will be implemented in the remaining states in which the company operates during and during  the company entered into a pilot program with guidewire  a commercially available software solution  for the homeowners line of business to replace legacy platforms 
guidewire implementation will begin in as part of the company s commitment to service excellence  the company launched an initiative in to improve its call center technologies 
the initiative s goal is to enhance telephony infrastructure using voice over internet protocol  centralized call recording  quality monitoring  and workforce management software 
the technology has been integrated with the company s claim processing software and deployed to the centralized customer service call center 
the company also implemented astonishing customers everyday in  a highly streamlined loss application system which enhances the personal auto claims process including automated rental car reservations  repair services  and a new roadside assistance program 
b 
regulatory and legal matters the process for implementing rate changes varies by state  with california  georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and nevada requiring prior approval from the respective doi before a rate may be implemented 
illinois  texas  virginia  arizona  and michigan only require that rates be filed with the doi  while oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate  or unfairly discriminatory 
during  the company implemented automobile and homeowners insurance rate decreases in california 
during  the company implemented automobile rate increases in four other states and a decrease in one other state 
the california doi uses rating factor regulations requiring automobile insurance rates to be determined in decreasing order of importance by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience  and other factors as determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 

table of contents in april  regulations became effective that generally tighten the existing proposition prior approval ratemaking regime primarily by establishing a maximum allowable rate of return calculated by adding percent plus the average of short  intermediate  and long term t bill rates and a minimum allowable rate of return of negative percent of surplus 
however  the practical impact of these limitations is unclear because the new regulations allow for the california doi to grant a number of variances based on loss prevention  business mix  service to underserved communities  and other factors 
in october  the california doi invited comments from consumer groups and the insurance industry in an effort to set appropriate standards for granting or denying specific variances and to provide sufficient instruction regarding what information or data to submit when an insurer is applying for a specific variance 
the comment period ended on november  the california doi then published proposed amendments to its regulations and held an informal workshop on them on april  on april   the commissioner issued a new notice reflecting slight modifications to the proposed regulations and superseding the prior version 
the proposed changes  which are subject to interpretation  were approved as emergency regulations by the office of administrative law oal on may  and became effective as of that date 
the company continues to assess the effect of this regulation on its rate filings 
on july   the california oal approved proposed regulations by the california doi that effectively reduce the weight that insurers can place on a person s residence when establishing automobile insurance rates 
insurance companies in california are required to file rating plans with the california doi that comply with the new regulations 
there was a two year phase in period for insurers to fully implement those plans 
the company made a rate filing in august that reduced the territorial impact of its rates and requested a small overall rate increase 
the california doi approved the august filing in january  which went into effect in april in july  the company made an additional rate filing to bring its rates into full compliance with the regulations 
the filing has not been approved at this time 
the company cannot predict whether the california doi will determine that the company s rates are in full compliance with the new regulations as a result of this filing 
in general  the company expects that the regulations will cause rates for urban drivers to decrease and those for non urban drivers to increase 
these rate changes are likely to increase consumer shopping for insurance which could affect the volume and the retention rates of the company s business 
it is the company s intention to maintain its competitive position in the marketplace while complying with the regulations 
in march  the california doi issued an amended notice of non compliance nnc to the nnc originally issued in february alleging that the company charged rates in violation of the california insurance code  willfully permitted its agents to charge broker fees in violation of california law  and willfully misrepresented the actual price insurance consumers could expect to pay for insurance by the amount of a fee charged by the consumer s insurance broker 
through this action  the california doi seeks to impose a fine for each policy in which the company allegedly permitted an agent to charge a broker fee  which the california doi contends is the use of an unapproved rate  rating plan or rating system 
further  the california doi seeks to impose a penalty for each and every date on which the company allegedly used a misleading advertisement alleged in the nnc 
finally  based upon the conduct alleged  the california doi also contends that the company acted fraudulently in violation of section a of the california insurance code  which permits the california commissioner of insurance to suspend certificates of authority for a period of one year 
the company filed a notice of defense in response to the nnc 
the company does not believe that it has done anything to warrant a monetary penalty from the california doi 
the san francisco superior court  in robert krumme  on behalf of the general public v 
mercury insurance company  mercury casualty company  and california automobile insurance company  denied plaintiff s requests for restitution or any other form of retrospective monetary relief based on the same facts and legal theory 
while a hearing before the administrative law judge had been set to start on september   the hearing has been vacated and continued to a future date to be determined 
this matter has been the subject of five continuations since the original nnc was issued in the company is not able to determine the impact of any of the regulatory matters described above 
it is possible that the impact of some of the changes could adversely affect the company and its operating results  however  the ultimate outcome is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 

table of contents the company is also involved in legal proceedings incidental to its insurance business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies litigation 
c 
critical accounting estimates reserves the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires judgment and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is required 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials  and labor rates  among other factors  can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of a claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the company calculates a point estimate rather than a range of loss reserve estimates 
there is inherent uncertainty with estimates and this is particularly true with estimates for loss reserves 
this uncertainty comes from many factors which may include changes in claims reporting and settlement patterns  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  uncertainty over inflation rates and uncertainty for unknown items 
the company does not make specific provisions for these uncertainties  rather it considers them in establishing its reserve by looking at historical patterns and trends and projecting these out to current reserves 
the underlying factors and assumptions that serve as the basis for preparing the reserve estimate include paid and incurred loss development factors  expected average costs per claim  inflation trends  expected loss ratios  industry data  and other relevant information 
the company also engages independent actuarial consultants to review the company s reserves and to provide the annual actuarial opinions required under state statutory accounting requirements 
the company does not rely on actuarial consultants for gaap reporting or periodic report disclosure purposes 
the company analyzes loss reserves quarterly primarily using the incurred loss  claim count  average severity  and paid loss development methods described below 
the company also uses the paid loss development method to analyze loss adjustment expenses reserves as part of its reserve analysis 
when deciding which method to use in estimating its reserves  the company evaluates the credibility of each method based on the maturity of the data available and the claims settlement practices for each particular line of business or coverage within a line of business 
when establishing the reserve  the company will generally analyze the results from all of the methods used rather than relying on one method 
while these methods are designed to determine the ultimate losses on claims under the company s policies  there is inherent uncertainty in all actuarial models since they use historical data to project outcomes 
the company believes that the techniques it uses provide a reasonable basis in estimating loss reserves 
the incurred loss development method analyzes historical incurred case loss case reserves plus paid losses development to estimate ultimate losses 
the company applies development factors against current case incurred losses by accident period to calculate ultimate expected losses 
the company believes that the incurred loss development method provides a reasonable basis for evaluating ultimate losses  particularly in the company s larger  more established lines of business which have a long operating history 
the claim count development method analyzes historical claim count development to estimate future incurred claim count development for current claims 
the company applies these development factors against current claim counts by accident period to calculate ultimate expected claim counts 
the average severity method analyzes historical loss payments and or incurred losses divided by closed claims and or total claims to calculate an estimated average cost per claim 
from this  the expected 
table of contents ultimate average cost per claim can be estimated 
the average severity method coupled with the claim count development method provide meaningful information regarding inflation and frequency trends that the company believes is useful in establishing reserves 
the paid loss development method analyzes historical payment patterns to estimate the amount of losses yet to be paid 
the company uses this method for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the company analyzes catastrophe losses separately from non catastrophe losses 
for catastrophe losses  the company determines claim counts based on claims reported and development expectations from previous catastrophes and applies an average expected loss per claim based on reserves established by adjusters and average losses on previous similar catastrophes 
there are many factors that can cause variability between the ultimate expected loss and the actual developed loss 
while there are certainly other factors  the company believes that the following three items tend to create the most variability between expected losses and actual losses 
inflation for the company s california automobile lines of business  total reserves are comprised of the following bi reserves approximately material damage md reserves  including collision and comprehensive property damage approximately loss adjustment expenses reserves approximately 
loss development on md reserves is generally insignificant because md claims are generally settled in a shorter period than bi reserves 
the majority of the loss adjustment expenses reserves are estimated costs to defend bi claims  which tend to require longer periods of time to settle as compared to md claims 
bi loss reserves are generally the most difficult to estimate because they take longer to close than other coverages 
bi coverage in the company s policies includes injuries sustained by any person other than the insured  except in the case of uninsured or underinsured motorist bi coverage  which covers damages to the insured for bi caused by uninsured or underinsured motorists 
bi payments are primarily for medical costs and general damages 
the following table represents the typical closure patterns of bi claims in the california automobile insurance coverage of total claims closed dollars paid bi claims closed in the accident year reported to bi claims closed one year after the accident year reported to bi claims closed two years after the accident year reported to bi claims closed three years after the accident year reported to bi claims closed in the accident year reported are generally the smaller and less complex claims that settle for approximately  to  on average  whereas the total average settlement  once all claims are closed in a particular accident year  is approximately  to  the company creates incurred and paid loss triangles to estimate ultimate losses utilizing historical payment and reserving patterns and evaluates the results of this analysis against its frequency and severity analysis to establish bi reserves 
the company adjusts development factors to account for inflation trends it sees in loss severity 
as a larger proportion of claims from an accident year are settled  there becomes a higher degree of certainty for the reserves established for that accident year 
consequently  there is a decreasing likelihood of reserve development on any particular accident 
table of contents year  as those periods age 
at december   the company believes that the accident years that are most likely to develop are the through accident years  however  it is also possible that older accident years could develop as well 
in general  the company expects that historical claims trends will continue with costs tending to increase  which is generally consistent with historical data  and therefore the company believes that it is more reasonable to expect inflation than deflation 
many potential factors can affect the bi inflation rate  including changes in statutes and regulations  change in the number of litigated files  general economic factors  timeliness of claims adjudication  vehicle safety  changes in weather patterns  and gasoline prices  however  the magnitude of such impact on the inflation rate is unknown 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the california automobile bi inflation rate could vary from recorded amounts by as much as   and for   and  respectively 
for example  at december   the loss severity for the amounts recorded at december  decreased by  and for the   and accident years  respectively 
comparatively  at december   the loss severity increased for the amount recorded at december  by   and for the   and accident years  respectively 
the following table shows the effects on the   and accident year california bi loss reserves based on possible variations in the severity recorded  however  the variation could be more or less than these amounts 
california bodily injury inflation reserve sensitivity analysis accident year number of claims expected a actual recorded severity at implied inflation rate recorded a pro forma severity if actual severity is lower by for  for  and for b pro forma severity if actual severity is higher by for  for  and for favorable loss development if actual severity is less than recorded column a unfavorable loss development if actual severity is more than recorded column b n a  total loss development favorable unfavorable  a the recent downward trend in the total number of claims reported is reflective of declining loss frequencies and a decline in the number of insurance policies issued 
the number of claims expected excludes those claims that were closed without any payment 
for the accident year  the company experienced increases in the average amounts paid on closed claims and slower claim file closings 
this generally indicates that there will be increases in loss severity 
as a result  the company believes that the inflation rate for the accident year is likely to be higher than the inflation rate for the accident year 
as discussed previously  there are many factors that impact inflation  but their impact on the recent inflation rate is currently unknown 

table of contents claim count development the company generally estimates ultimate claim counts for an accident period based on development of claim counts in prior accident periods 
for california automobile bi claims  the company has experienced that approximately to additional claims will be reported in the year subsequent to an accident year 
however  such late reported claims could be more or less than the company s expectations 
typically  almost every claim is reported within one year following the end of an accident year and at that point the company has a high degree of certainty as to what the ultimate claim count will be 
the following table shows the number of bi claims reported at the end of the accident period and one year later california bodily injury claim count development table accident year number of claims reported at december of each accident year number of claims reported at december one year later percentage increase in number of claims reported as illustrated in the table above  excluding and  the range of the percentage increase in number of claims reported has been between approximately and 
the number of bi claims increased by and in and  respectively  amounts that are somewhat outside the normal range 
there are many potential factors that can affect the number of claims reported after a period end 
these factors include changes in weather patterns  a change in the number of litigated files  and whether the last day of the year falls on a weekday or a weekend 
however  the company is unable to determine which  if any  of the factors actually impact the number of claims reported and  if so  by what magnitude 
at december   there were  bi claims reported for the accident year and the company estimates that these are expected to ultimately grow by 
the company believes that while actual development in recent years has ranged between approximately and  it is reasonable to expect that the range could be as great as between and 
actual development may be more or less than the expected range 
the following table shows the effect on loss development based on different claim count within the broader possible range at december  california bodily injury claim count reserve sensitivity analysis accident year claims reported amount recorded at at claim count development total expected amount if claim count development is total expected amount if claim count development is claim count approximate average cost per claim not meaningful    total dollars not meaningful    total loss development favorable unfavorable 
table of contents unexpected large losses from older accident periods unexpected large losses are generally not provided for in the current reserve because they are not known or expected and tend to be unquantifiable 
once known  the company establishes a provision for the losses  but it is not possible to provide any meaningful sensitivity analysis as to the potential size of any unexpected losses 
these losses can be caused by many factors  including unexpected legal interpretations of coverage  ineffective claims handling  regulation extending claims reporting periods  assumption of unexpected or unknown risks  adverse court decisions as well as many unknown factors 
unexpected large losses are fairly infrequent but can have a large impact on the company s losses 
to mitigate this specific risk the company has established claims handling and review procedures 
however  it is still possible that these procedures will not prove entirely effective and the company may have material unexpected large losses in future periods 
it is also possible that the company has not identified and established a sufficient reserve for all of unexpected large losses occurring in the older accident years  even though a comprehensive claims file review was undertaken  or that the company will experience additional development on these reserves 
discussion of loss reserves and prior period loss development at december  at december  and  the company recorded its point estimate of approximately  million and  million  respectively  in losses and loss adjustment expenses liabilities which include approximately and million  respectively  of ibnr loss reserves 
ibnr includes estimates  based upon past experience  of ultimate developed costs which may differ from case estimates  unreported claims which occurred on or prior to december  and estimated future payments for reopened claims 
management believes that the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date  however  since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates  the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provisions 
the company evaluates its reserves quarterly 
when management determines that the estimated ultimate claim cost requires a decrease for previously reported accident years  favorable development occurs and a reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period 
if the estimated ultimate claim cost requires an increase for previously reported accident years  unfavorable development occurs and an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period 
for  the company reported favorable development of approximately million on the and prior accident years losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves which at december  totaled approximately billion 
the favorable development in is largely the result of re estimates of accident year and california bi losses which have experienced both lower average severities and fewer late reported claims claim count development than were originally estimated at december  in addition  there was favorable development from a recovery of approximately million related to losses incurred on wildfires 
premiums the company s insurance premiums are recognized as income ratably over the term of the policies  that is  in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
unearned premiums are carried as a liability on the balance sheet and are computed on a monthly pro rata basis 
the company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs to related unearned premiums  net of investment income 
to the extent that any of the company s lines of business become substantially unprofitable  a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the company does not expect this to occur on any of its significant lines of business

table of contents investments beginning january   all of the company s fixed maturity and equity investments are classified as trading and carried at fair value as required when electing the fair value option  with changes in fair value reflected in net realized investment gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to january   the company s fixed maturity and equity investment portfolios were classified either as available for sale or trading and carried at fair value  with changes in fair value of available for sale securities reflected in unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and changes in fair value of trading securities reflected in net realized investment gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the majority of equity holdings  including non sinking fund preferred stocks  are actively traded on national exchanges or trading markets  and were valued at the last transaction price on the balance sheet date 
fair value of financial instruments the financial instruments recorded in the consolidated balance sheets include investments  receivables  interest rate swap agreements  accounts payable  equity contracts  and secured and unsecured notes payable 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
due to their short term maturity  the carrying value of receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair market values 
all investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value  as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s financial instruments include securities issued by the us government and its agencies  securities issued by state and municipal government and agencies  certain corporate and other debt securities  corporate equity securities  and exchange traded funds 
over of the fair value of the financial instruments held at december  is based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or is derived from such prices or parameters 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary across different financial instruments 
observable market prices and pricing parameters for a financial instrument  or a related financial instrument  are used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
certain financial instruments that the company holds or acquires may lack observable market prices or market parameters currently or in future periods because they are less actively traded 
the fair value of such instruments is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular financial instrument 
these techniques may involve some degree of judgment 
the price transparency of the particular financial instrument will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of financial instrument  whether it is a new financial instrument and not yet established in the marketplace  and the characteristics particular to the transaction 
financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency 
by contrast  financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have diminished price transparency 
even in normally active markets  the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation 
alternatively  in thinly quoted markets  the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a financial instrument provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise is not actively quoted

income taxes at december   the company s deferred income taxes were in a net asset position materially due to unearned premiums  expense accruals  loss reserve discounting  and deferred tax recognition of capital losses 
the company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized and  to the extent management does not believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized  a valuation allowance is established 

table of contents management s recoverability assessment of its deferred tax assets which are ordinary in character takes into consideration the company s strong history of generating ordinary taxable income and a reasonable expectation that it will continue to generate ordinary taxable income in the future 
further  the company has the capacity to recoup its ordinary deferred tax assets 
finally  the company has various deferred tax liabilities which represent sources of future ordinary taxable income 
management s recoverability assessment with regards to its capital deferred tax assets is based on estimates of anticipated capital gains and tax planning strategies available to generate future taxable capital gains  both of which would contribute to the realization of deferred tax benefits 
the company expects to hold certain quantities of debt securities  which are currently in loss positions  to recovery or maturity 
management believes unrealized losses related to these debt securities  which represent a significant portion of the unrealized loss positions at year end  are not subject to default risk 
thus  the principal amounts are believed to be fully realizable at maturity 
the company has a long term horizon for holding these securities  which management believes will allow avoidance of forced sales prior to maturity 
the company also has unrealized gains in its investment portfolio which could be realized through asset dispositions  at management s discretion 
further  the company has the capability to generate additional realized capital gains by entering into a sale leaseback transaction using one or more properties of its appreciated real estate holdings 
finally  the company has an established history of generating capital gain premiums earned through its common stock call option program 
based on the continued existence of the options market  the substantial amount of capital committed to supporting the call option program  and the company s favorable track record in generating net capital gains from this program in both upward and downward markets  management believes it will be able to generate sufficient amounts of capital gains from this program  if necessary  to recover recorded capital deferred tax assets 
the company has the capability to implement tax planning strategies as it has a steady history of generating positive cash flow from operations  as well as the reasonable expectation that its cash flow needs can be met in future periods without the forced sale of its investments 
this capability will enable management to use its discretion in controlling the timing and amount of realized losses it generates during future periods 
by prudent utilization of some or all of these actions  management believes that it has the ability and intent to generate capital gains  and minimize tax losses  in a manner sufficient to avoid losing the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
management will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets arise primarily as a result of business acquisitions and consist of the excess of the cost of the acquisitions over the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the company annually evaluates goodwill for impairment using widely accepted valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of its reporting units 
the company also reviews its goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its implied fair value 
as of december   the fair value of the company s reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value 
contingent liabilities the company has known  and may have unknown  potential liabilities which include claims  assessments  or lawsuits relating to the company s business 
the company continually evaluates these potential liabilities and accrues for them or discloses them in the notes to the consolidated financial statements where required 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities  an unfavorable result may have a material impact on the company s quarterly results of operations  however  it is not expected to be material to the company s financial position

prior to the acquisition of ais  the company deferred the recognition of commissions paid to ais to match the earnings of the related premiums 
now that ais is a wholly owned subsidiary  commissions are no longer paid or deferred  and direct expenses are reflected in the expense ratio 
further  to improve profitability  the company implemented several cost reduction programs including a salary freeze  a suspension of the employee k matching program  and a workforce reduction primarily located in california

liquidity and capital resources a 
general the company is largely dependent upon dividends received from its insurance subsidiaries to pay debt service costs and to make distributions to its shareholders 
under current insurance law  the insurance companies are entitled to pay ordinary dividends of approximately million in actual ordinary dividends paid from the insurance companies to mercury general during were million 
as of december   mercury general also had approximately million in investments and cash that could be utilized to satisfy its direct holding company obligations 
the principal sources of funds for the insurance companies are premiums  sales and maturity of invested assets  and dividend and interest income from invested assets 
the principal uses of funds for the insurance companies are the payment of claims and related expenses  operating expenses  dividends to mercury general  and the purchase of investments 
b 
cash flows the company has generated positive cash flow from operations for over twenty consecutive years 
because of the company s long track record of positive operating cash flows  it does not attempt to match the duration and timing of asset maturities with those of liabilities 
rather  the company manages its portfolio with a view towards maximizing total return with an emphasis on after tax income 
with combined cash and short term investments of million at december   the company believes its cash flow from operations is adequate to satisfy its liquidity requirements without the forced sale of investments 
however  the company operates in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs or that the company will not be required to raise additional funds to meet those needs  including future business expansion  through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities with lending institutions 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  an increase of million over the increase was primarily due to a decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses paid and tax expenses paid in compared with additionally  the company had operating cash flows in generated by ais after the acquisition

invested assets portfolio composition an important component of the company s financial results is the return on its investment portfolio 
the company s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
the investment strategy has historically focused on maximizing after tax yield with a primary emphasis on maintaining a well diversified  investment grade  fixed income portfolio to support the underlying liabilities and achieve return on capital and profitable growth 
the company believes that investment yield is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to enhance after tax yield and minimize the potential effect of downgrades and defaults 
the company continues to believe that this strategy maintains the optimal investment performance necessary to sustain investment income over time 
the company s portfolio management approach utilizes a recognized market risk and consistent asset allocation strategy as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive  liquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements 
within the ranges set by the asset allocation strategy  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
the following table sets forth the composition of the total investment portfolio of the company at december  cost fair value amounts in thousands fixed maturity securities us government bonds and agencies states  municipalities and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities corporate securities collateralized debt obligations equity securities common stock public utilities banks  trusts and insurance companies industrial and other non redeemable preferred stock short term investments total investments fixed maturities and short term bonds at amortized cost  and equities and other short term investments at cost 

table of contents at december   of the company s total investment portfolio at fair value and of its total fixed maturity investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt state and municipal bonds 
equity holdings consist of perpetual preferred stocks and dividend bearing common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax sheltered by the corporate dividend exclusion 
at december   of short term investments consisted of highly rated short duration securities redeemable on a daily or weekly basis 
the company does not have any material direct investment in subprime lenders 
during  the company recognized approximately million in net realized investment gains  which include approximately million and million related to fixed maturity securities and equity securities  respectively 
included in the gains were million and million in gains due to changes in the fair value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio and equity security portfolio  respectively  as a result of electing the fair value option 
partially offsetting these gains were approximately million and million in losses from the sale of fixed maturity securities and equity securities  respectively 
during  the company recognized approximately million in net realized investment losses  of which  approximately million was related to fixed maturity securities and approximately million was related to equity securities 
the losses were primarily due to extreme volatility in the capital markets and a widening of credit spreads beyond historic norms in the third and fourth quarters of included in this loss is million related to the change in fair value of the total investment portfolio 
losses were approximately million and million from the sale of fixed maturity securities and equity securities  respectively 
fixed maturity securities fixed maturity securities include debt securities and redeemable preferred stocks  which may have fixed or variable principal payment schedules  may be held for indefinite periods of time  and may be used as a part of the company s asset liability strategy or sold in response to changes in interest rates  anticipated prepayments  risk reward characteristics  liquidity needs  tax planning considerations or other economic factors 
a primary exposure for the fixed maturity securities is interest rate risk 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
as assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s historical investment philosophy has resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
the nominal average maturities of the overall bond portfolio  including short term bonds  were years and years at december  and  respectively  which reflect a portfolio heavily weighted in investment grade tax exempt municipal bonds 
fixed maturity investments purchased by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
the call adjusted average maturities of the overall bond portfolio  including short term bonds  were approximately years and years at december  and  respectively  related to holdings which are heavily weighted with high coupon issues that are expected to be called prior to maturity 
the modified durations of the overall bond portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls were years and years  including collateralized mortgage obligations with modified durations of approximately years and years at december  and  respectively  and short term bonds that carry no duration 
modified duration measures the length of time it takes  on average  to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
as it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms  which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
another exposure related to the fixed maturity securities is credit risk  which is managed by maintaining a weighted average portfolio credit quality rating of aa  compared to aa at december   with the decline in rating due primarily to the downgrading of municipal bonds insurer ratings 
to calculate the weighted average credit quality ratings as disclosed throughout this form k  individual securities were weighted based on fair value and a credit quality numeric score that was assigned to each rating grade 
bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically  within the tax exempt sector 
holdings in the taxable sector consist principally of investment grade issues 
at december   fixed maturity holdings rated below investment grade and non rated bonds totaled million and million  respectively  at fair value  and represented approximately 
table of contents and  respectively  of total fixed maturity securities 
at december   fixed maturity holdings  excluding preferred shares  rated below investment grade and non rated bonds totaled million and million  respectively at fair value  and represented approximately and  respectively  of total fixed maturity securities 
the following table presents the credit quality ratings of the company s fixed maturity portfolio by security type at december  at fair value 
credit quality ratings are based on the average of ratings assigned by nationally recognized securities rating organizations 
credit ratings for the company s fixed maturity portfolio were down slightly as compared to the prior year  with of fixed maturity securities at fair value experiencing no change in their overall rating 
approximately experienced downgrades during the period  offset by approximately in credit upgrades 
the majority of the downgrades were due to continued downgrading of the monoline insurance carried on much of the municipal holdings 
the majority of the downgrades was slight and still within the investment grade portfolio  although million  at fair value  was downgraded to below investment grade

table of contents municipal securities the company had approximately billion at fair value billion at amortized cost in municipal bonds at december   with an unrealized gain of million 
over half of the municipal bond positions are insured by bond insurers

the company considers the strength of the underlying credit as a buffer against potential market value declines which may result from future rating downgrades of the bond insurers 
in addition  the company has a long term time horizon for its municipal bond holdings which generally allows it to recover the full principal amounts upon maturity  avoiding forced sales prior to maturity  of bonds that have declined in market value due to the bond insurers rating downgrades 
based on the uncertainty surrounding the financial condition of these insurers  it is possible that there will be additional downgrades to below investment grade ratings by the rating agencies in the future  and such downgrades could impact the estimated fair value of municipal bonds 
at december  and  municipal securities included auction rate securities 
the company owned million and million at fair value of auction rate securities at december  and  respectively 
auction rate securities were valued based on a discounted cash flow model with certain inputs that were not observable in the market and are considered level inputs 
mortgage backed securities the mortgage backed securities portfolio is categorized as loans to prime borrowers except for approximately million and million million and million amortized cost of alt a mortgages at december  and  respectively 
alt a mortgage backed securities are at fixed or variable rates and include certain securities that are collateralized by residential mortgage loans issued to borrowers with stronger credit profiles than sub prime borrowers  but do not qualify for prime financing terms due to high loan to value ratios or limited supporting documentation 
at december   the company had no holdings in commercial mortgage backed securities  but had approximately million  at fair value  in interest only mortgage backed securities 
while these interest only mortgage backed securities are aaa rated us government agency issues  their projected future cash flows can be adversely affected due to increased prepayment activity on the underlying collateral 
the weighted average rating of the company s alt a mortgage backed securities is bbb and the weighted average rating of the entire mortgage backed securities portfolio is aa

debt effective january   the company acquired ais for million 
the acquisition was financed by a million credit facility that is secured by municipal bonds held as collateral 
the credit facility calls for the 
table of contents collateral requirement to be greater than the loan amount 
the collateral requirement is calculated as the fair market value of the municipal bonds held as collateral multiplied by the advance rates  which vary based on the credit quality and duration of the assets held and range between and of the fair value of each bond 
the loan matures on january  with interest payable at a floating rate of libor plus basis points 
on february   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its floating libor rate on the loan for a fixed rate of  resulting in a total fixed rate of 
the purpose of the swap is to offset the variability of cash flows resulting from the variable interest rate 
the swap is not designated as a hedge and changes in the fair value are adjusted through the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change 
in february  the company acquired an  square foot office building in folsom  california for approximately million 
the company financed the transaction through an million bank loan that is secured by municipal securities held as collateral 
the loan matures on march  with interest payable quarterly at an annual floating rate of libor plus basis points 
on march   the company entered into an interest rate swap of a floating libor rate on the loan for a fixed rate of  resulting in a total fixed rate of 
the swap agreement terminates on march  the swap is designated as a cash flow hedge wherein the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
on august   the company completed a public debt offering issuing million of senior notes 
the notes are unsecured  senior obligations of the company with a annual coupon payable on august and february each year commencing february  these notes mature on august  the company used the proceeds from the senior notes to retire amounts payable under existing revolving credit facilities  which were terminated 
effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of a fixed rate obligation on the senior notes for a floating rate of libor plus basis points 
the swap significantly reduced the interest expense in and when the effective interest rate was and  respectively 
however  if the libor interest rate increases in the future  the company will incur higher interest expense in the future 
the swap is designated as a fair value hedge and qualifies for the shortcut method wherein the gain or loss on the derivative  and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized in current earnings

regulatory capital requirement the insurance companies must comply with minimum capital requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
the minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premiums  a percentage of annualized loss  or rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the naic 
the rbc formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements  and a number of other factors 
at december   the insurance companies had sufficient capital to exceed the highest level of minimum required capital 

table of contents industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all the insurance companies of  million at december   and net premiums written of  million  the ratio of premium written to surplus was to off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under regulation s k a and the instructions thereto 
contractual obligations the company s significant contractual obligations at december  are summarized as follows contractual obligations total thereafter amounts in thousands debt including interest lease obligations losses and loss adjustment expenses contingent consideration total contractual obligations the company s debt contains various terms  conditions and covenants which  if violated by the company  would result in a default and could result in the acceleration of the company s payment obligations 
amounts differ from the balance presented on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  because the debt amount above includes interest 
the company is obligated under various non cancellable lease agreements providing for office space and equipment rental that expire at various dates through the year reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including ibnr as of december  the company has estimated the timing of these payments based on its historical experience and expectation of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts which are the company s best estimates 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement effective january   the company may be required to pay up to million over the next year as additional consideration for the ais acquisition 
based on the projected performance of the ais business  the company does not expect to pay the contingent consideration 
the table excludes liabilities of million related to uncertainty in tax settlements as the company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of related future payments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures primarily due to its investing and borrowing activities 
primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates  equity prices  and credit risk 
adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in the liquidity of a market  or to changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and risk tolerance 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 

table of contents overview the company s investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks  including accountability and controls over risk management activities  and specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile  and regulatory requirements of the subsidiaries 
executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through the company s investment committee 
the investment committee focuses on strategies to enhance after tax yields  mitigate market risks  and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns 
the company manages exposures to market risk through the use of asset allocation  duration  and credit ratings 
asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
duration limits on the fixed maturities portfolio place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
credit risk credit risk is risk due to uncertainty in a counterparty s ability to meet its obligations 
credit risk is managed by maintaining a weighted average fixed maturities portfolio credit quality rating of aa  compared to aa at december   with the decline in rating due primarily to the downgrading of municipal bonds insurer ratings 
historically  the ten year default rate per moody s for aa rated municipal bonds has been less than 
the company s municipal bond holdings  which represent of its fixed maturity portfolio at december  at fair value  are broadly diversified geographically 
approximately of municipal bond holdings are in the tax exempt sector 
the largest holdings are in populous states such as texas and california  however  such holdings are further diversified primarily between cities  counties  schools  public works  hospitals and state general obligations 
in california  the company owns approximately million at fair value of general obligations of the state at december  credit risk is addressed by limiting exposure to any particular issuer to ensure diversification 
taxable fixed maturity securities represent of the company s fixed maturity portfolio 
approximately of the company s taxable fixed maturity securities were comprised of us government bonds and agencies  which were rated aaa at december  approximately of the company s taxable fixed maturity securities were rated below investment grade 
below investment grade issues are considered watch list items by the company  and their status is evaluated within the context of the company s overall portfolio and its investment policy on an aggregate risk management basis  as well as their ability to recover their investment on an individual issue basis 
credit ratings for the company s fixed maturity portfolio were slightly lower during  with of the fixed maturity portfolio at fair value experiencing no change in overall rating  approximately experienced downgrades during the period  and approximately in credit upgrades 
the majority of the downgrades were due to continued downgrading of the monoline insurance carried on much of the municipal holdings 
the majority of the downgrades was slight and still within the investment grade portfolio and only approximately million at fair value was downgraded to below investment grade  allowing the company to maintain a high overall credit rating on its fixed maturity securities 
equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that the company will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets 
at december   the company s primary objective for common equity investments is current income 
the fair value of the equity investment consists of million in common stocks and million in non redeemable preferred stocks 
the common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the current market expectation is cautiously optimistic following 
table of contents government programs designed to sustain the economy 
the company has also allocated more to the energy sector relative to the s p index to hedge against potential inflationary pressures on the equity markets possible in a sudden economic recovery 
the common equity portfolio represents approximately of total investments at fair value 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was at december  based on a hypothetical or reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million or million  respectively 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this risk arises from many of its primary activities  as the company invests substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and issues interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in us treasury yields and other key benchmarks as well as changes in interest rates resulting from the widening credit spreads and credit exposure to collateralized securities 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio  which represents of total investment at fair value  is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases and vice versa 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that utilizes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company has historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s historical investment philosophy resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
the decrease in municipal bond credit spreads in caused the overall market interest rate to decrease  which resulted in the decrease in the duration of the company s portfolio 
consequently  the modified duration of the bond portfolio  including short term investments  is years at december  compared to years and years at december  and  respectively 
given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis or basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the bond portfolio at december  would decrease by approximately million or million  respectively 
interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate risk associated with the company s loans with fixed or floating rates 
on february   the company entered into an interest swap of its floating libor rate on the million credit facility for a fixed rate of  resulting in a total fixed rate of 
on march   the company entered into an interest rate swap of a floating libor rate on an million bank loan for a fixed rate of  resulting in a total fixed rate of 
in addition  effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of a fixed rate obligation on its million senior note for a floating rate of libor plus basis points
