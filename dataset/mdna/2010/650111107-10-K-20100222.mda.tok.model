revenues  operating profit and identifiable assets of foreign operations are not significant 
our businesses have historically experienced second and fourth quarter advertising volume business the new york times company p 

table of contents that is generally higher than first and third quarter volume because of lower economic activity during the winter and summer 
we believe these seasonal trends were partially masked in and by volume declines principally attributable to the general economic slowdown 
news media group the news media group segment consists of the new york times media group  the new england media group and the regional media group 
advertising revenue a significant portion of the news media group s revenue is derived from advertising sold in its newspapers and other publications and on its web sites  as discussed below 
we divide such advertising into three basic categories national  retail and classified 
advertising revenue also includes preprints  which are advertising supplements 
advertising revenue information for the news media group appears under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

production and distribution the times is currently printed at our production and distribution facility in college point  ny  as well as under contract at remote print sites across the united states 
in january  we closed our subsidiary  city suburban delivery systems  inc city suburban  which operated a wholesale distribution business that delivered the times and other newspapers and magazines to newsstands and retail outlets in the new york metropolitan area

in other markets in the united states and canada  the times is delivered through agreements with other newspapers and third party delivery agents

risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors described below  as well as the other information included in this annual report on form k 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any or all of these risks  or by other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial  that may adversely affect us in the future 
economic weakness and uncertainty in the united states  in the regions in which we operate and in key advertising categories has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our advertising revenues 
advertising spending  which drives a significant portion of our revenues  is sensitive to economic conditions 
national and local economic conditions  particularly in the new york city and boston metropolitan regions  as well as in florida  affect the levels of our national  retail and classified advertising revenue 
economic factors that have adversely affected advertising revenue include weakened consumer and business spending  high unemployment  declining home sales and other challenges affecting the economy 
our advertising revenues are particularly adversely affected if advertisers respond to weak economic conditions by reducing their budgets or shifting spending patterns or priorities  or if they are forced to consolidate or cease operations 
continuing weak economic conditions and outlook would adversely affect our level of advertising revenues and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all of our businesses face substantial competition for advertisers and audiences 
we face substantial competition for advertising revenue in our various markets from free and paid newspapers  magazines  web sites  television  radio  other forms of media  direct marketing and the yellow pages 
competition for advertising is generally based on audience levels and demographics  price  service and advertising results 
it has intensified both as a result of the continued development and fragmentation of digital media and adverse economic conditions 
competition from all of these media and services affects our ability to attract and retain advertisers and consumers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates 
our reputations for quality journalism and content are important in competing for advertising revenue in this environment 
these reputations are based on consumer and advertiser perceptions 
if they are perceived as less reliable or are otherwise damaged or if consumers fail to differentiate our content from other content providers on the internet or otherwise  we may experience a decline in revenues 
the increasing popularity of digital media and the progressing shift in consumer habits and advertising expenditures from traditional to digital media may adversely affect our revenues if we are unable to successfully grow our digital businesses 
web sites and applications for mobile devices distributing news and other content continue to gain popularity 
as a result  audience attention and advertising spending have shifted and may continue to shift from traditional media forms to the internet and other digital media 
we expect that advertisers will continue to allocate greater portions of their budgets to digital media  which can offer more measurable returns than traditional print media through pay for performance and keyword targeted advertising 
this secular shift has intensified competition for advertising in traditional media and has contributed to and may continue to contribute to a decline in print advertising 
in addition  as audience attention is increasingly focused on digital media  circulation of our newspapers may be adversely affected  which may decrease circulation revenue and exacerbate declines in print advertising 
if we are not successful in growing our digital businesses to offset declines in revenues from our print products  our business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to retain and grow our digital audience and advertiser base  our digital businesses will be adversely affected 
the increasing number of digital media options available on the internet  through mobile devices and through social networking tools is expanding consumer choice significantly 
as a result  we may not be able to increase our online traffic sufficiently and retain a base of frequent visitors to our web sites and applications on mobile devices 
if traffic levels decline or stagnate  we may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital businesses and to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our web sites 
even if we maintain traffic levels  the market position of our brands may not be sufficient to counteract the significant downward pressure on advertising risk factors the new york times company p 

table of contents rates that the marketplace has experienced as a result of a significant increase in inventory 
we may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on web sites proliferates 
online traffic is also driven by internet search results  including search results provided by google  the primary search engine directing traffic to the web sites of the about group and many of our other sites 
our digital businesses may be negatively affected if search engines change the methods for directing search queries to web pages 
cost per click revenue of the about group is principally derived from an arrangement with google 
adverse developments affecting google s ability to place third party advertising on the about group s web sites may have an adverse effect on the about group s business  financial condition and prospects 
faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information  consumers are favoring personalized  up to the minute sources of news in custom targeted formats 
the increasing popularity of news aggregation web sites and customized news feeds may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for the audience to visit our web sites or use our digital applications 
in addition  the presentation of some of our content in aggregation with other content may lead audiences to fail to appreciate the full depth of the products and services we offer and to distinguish our content from the content of other providers 
if  as a result  we are unable to maintain and grow our digital audience  our digital businesses will be adversely affected 
the dynamic and evolving digital environment presents multiple challenges that could adversely affect our efforts to further develop our digital businesses 
our digital businesses operate in a highly dynamic and rapidly evolving competitive environment in which consumer demand moves in unanticipated directions due to the evolution of competitive alternatives  rapid technological change and regulatory developments 
as mobile phones and other devices are becoming increasingly important alternatives to computer internet access  the expectations and preferences of our audience may change further 
our digital businesses will only succeed if we manage to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors while developing new forms of content that provide optimal user experiences 
we announced in january that we will introduce a paid model for nytimes 
com at the beginning of with the intention to create a second revenue stream while preserving nytimes 
com s robust advertising business 
our ability to build an online subscriber base depends on market acceptance  the timely development of an adequate online infrastructure and other factors that are required to derive significant online subscription revenue from the paid model 
traffic levels may stagnate or decline as a result of the implementation of the paid model  which may adversely affect nytimes 
com s advertiser base and advertising rates and result in a decline in online revenues 
technological developments and any changes we make to our business model may require significant capital investments 
we may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital opportunities and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology infrastructure 
it may also be difficult to attract and retain talent for critical positions 
some of our existing competitors and possible additional entrants may have greater operational  financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to compete for opportunities and as a result  our digital businesses may be less successful 
we may not be able to maintain and form strategic relationships to attract more consumers  which depend on the efforts of our partners  fellow investors and licensees that may be beyond our control 
if we cannot address all the challenges we face in the continued development of our digital businesses in this environment  our business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 
decreases in circulation volume adversely affect our circulation and advertising revenues 
advertising and circulation revenues are affected by circulation and readership levels of our newspaper properties 
competition for circulation and readership is generally based upon format  content  quality  service and price 
in recent years  our newspaper properties  and the newspaper industry as a whole  have experienced declining print circulation volume 
this is due to  among other factors  increased competition from new media formats and sources other than traditional newspapers often free to users  p 
annual report risk factors 
table of contents declining discretionary spending by consumers affected by weak economic conditions  high subscription and newsstand rates  and a growing preference among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper 
we have also experienced volume declines as a result of our strategy to reduce other paid circulation to focus promotional spending on individually paid circulation  which is generally more profitable  and the implementation of circulation price increases at many of our newspaper properties 
if these or other factors result in a prolonged decline in circulation volume  the rate and volume of advertising revenues may be adversely affected as rates reflect circulation and readership  among other factors 
circulation revenue may also be adversely affected if higher subscription and newsstand prices are not sufficient to offset volume declines 
events with short term negative impact may have a disproportionate effect if they occur during a time of high seasonal demand 
our businesses have historically experienced second and fourth quarter advertising volume that is generally higher than the first and third quarter volume because of lower economic activity during the winter and summer 
if an event with short term negative impact on our business were to occur during a time of high seasonal demand  there could be a disproportionate effect on the operating results of that business for the year 
changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity  increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 
our long term debt is currently rated below investment grade by standard poor s and moody s investors service 
if our credit ratings remain below investment grade or are lowered further  borrowing costs for future long term debt or short term borrowing facilities may increase and our financing options  including our access to the unsecured borrowing market  will be more limited 
we may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility 
in addition  macroeconomic conditions  such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets  would adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital intensive internal initiatives 
if we are unable to execute cost control measures successfully  our total operating costs may be greater than expected  which may adversely affect our profitability 
we have significantly reduced operating costs by reducing staff and employee benefits and implementing general cost control measures across the company  and expect to continue these cost control efforts 
if we do not achieve expected savings or our operating costs increase as a result of our strategic initiatives  our total operating costs may be greater than anticipated 
in addition  if our cost reduction strategy is not managed properly  such efforts may affect the quality of our products and our ability to generate future revenue 
reductions in staff and employee compensation and benefits could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees 
in addition  we operate with significant operating leverage 
significant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues 
if we are not able to implement further cost control efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues  we may experience a higher percentage decline in our income from continuing operations 
sustained increases in costs of providing pension and employee health and welfare benefits and the underfunded status of our pension plans may adversely affect our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
employee wages and benefits  including pension expense  account for approximately of our total operating costs 
as a result  our profitability is significantly affected by costs of pension benefits and other employee benefits 
factors beyond our control  including the interest rate environment and returns on plan assets  affect our pension expense and may increase our funding obligations 
our qualified pension plans were underfunded as of the january  valuation date and we expect to make substantial contributions in the future to fund this deficiency 
if interest rates remain low  investment returns are below expectations  or there is no further legislative relief  those contributions may be higher than currently anticipated

table of contents a significant number of our employees are unionized  and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations 
more than of our full time equivalent work force are unionized 
as a result  we are required to negotiate the wages  salaries  benefits  staffing levels and other terms with many of our employees collectively 
our results could be adversely affected if future labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations 
if we were to experience labor unrest  strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise or if we are unable to negotiate labor contracts on reasonable terms  our ability to produce and deliver our most significant products could be impaired 
in addition  our ability to make short term adjustments to control compensation and benefits costs  rebalance our portfolio of businesses or otherwise adapt to changing business needs may be limited by the terms of our collective bargaining agreements 
due to our participation in multiemployer pension plans  we have exposures under those plans that may extend beyond what our obligations would be with respect to our employees 
we participate in  and make periodic contributions to  various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our union employees 
our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds  inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability  lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies 
we incurred significant pension withdrawal liabilities in in connection with amendments to various collective bargaining agreements affecting certain multiemployer pension plans and the closure of city suburban  which resulted in the partial or complete cessation of contributions to certain multiemployer plans 
we may be required to make additional contributions under applicable law with respect to those plans or other multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw 
our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan will depend on the extent of that plan s funding of vested benefits 
if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities  such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 
a significant increase in the price of newsprint  or limited availability of newsprint supply  would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
the cost of raw materials  of which newsprint is the major component  represented approximately of our total operating costs in the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and may increase as a result of various factors  including consolidation in the north american newsprint industry  which has reduced the number of suppliers  declining newsprint supply as a result of paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper  and other factors that adversely impact supplier profitability  including increases in operating expenses caused by raw material and energy costs  and a rise in the value of the canadian dollar  which adversely affects canadian suppliers  whose costs are incurred in canadian dollars but whose newsprint sales are priced in us dollars 
in addition  we rely on our suppliers for deliveries of newsprint 
the availability of our newsprint supply may be affected by various factors  including strikes and other disruptions that may affect deliveries of newsprint 
if newsprint prices increase significantly or we experience significant disruptions in the availability of our newsprint supply in the future  our operating results will be adversely affected 
we may buy or sell different properties as a result of our evaluation of our portfolio of businesses

from time to time  we evaluate the various components of our portfolio of businesses and may  as a result  buy or sell different properties 
these acquisitions or divestitures affect our costs  revenues  profitability and financial position 
we may also consider the acquisition of specific properties or businesses that fall outside our traditional lines of business if we deem such properties sufficiently attractive

fair value could be adversely affected by changing market conditions within our industry 
an impairment charge would adversely affect our reported earnings 
acquisitions involve risks  including difficulties in integrating acquired operations  diversions of management resources  debt incurred in financing these acquisitions including the related possible reduction in our credit ratings and increase in our cost of borrowing  differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness at the acquired entities and other unanticipated problems and liabilities 
competition for certain types of acquisitions  particularly internet properties  is significant 
even if successfully negotiated  closed and integrated  certain acquisitions or investments may prove not to advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets 
divestitures also have inherent risks  including possible delays in closing transactions including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals  the risk of lower than expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses  unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from our integrated information technology systems and other operating systems  and potential post closing claims for indemnification 
in addition  current economic conditions may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts 
expected cost savings  which are offset by revenue losses from divested businesses  may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to our fixed cost structure 
from time to time  we make noncontrolling minority investments in private entities 
we may have limited voting rights and an inability to influence the direction of such entities  although income from such investments may represent a significant portion of our income 
therefore  the success of these ventures may be dependent upon the efforts of our partners  fellow investors and licensees 
these investments are generally illiquid  and the absence of a market inhibits our ability to dispose of them 
this inhibition as well as an inability to control the timing or process relating to a disposition could adversely affect our liquidity and the value we may ultimately attain on a disposition 
if the value of the companies in which we invest declines  we may be required to take a charge to earnings 
we may not be able to protect intellectual property rights upon which our business relies  and if we lose intellectual property protection  our assets may lose value

we believe our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our content  services  technology and other intellectual property  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and merchants  or unauthorized use of these rights 
advancements in technology have exacerbated the risk by making it easier to duplicate and disseminate content 
in addition  as our business and the risk of misappropriation of our intellectual property rights have become more global in scope  we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in a cost effective manner in a multitude of jurisdictions with varying laws 
if we are unable to procure  protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  we may not realize the full value of these assets  and our business may suffer 
if we must litigate in the united states or elsewhere to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  such litigation may be costly and divert the attention of our management

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condi tion and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial condition as of december   and results of operations for the three years ended december  this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report 
executive overview we are a diversified media company that currently includes newspapers  internet businesses  investments in paper mills and other investments 
our segments and divisions are logo our revenues were billion in the percentage of revenues contributed by division is below 
logo news media group the news media group generates revenues principally from print and online advertising and through circulation 
other revenues primarily consist of revenues from news services syndication  commercial printing  digital archives  rental income and direct mail advertising services 
the news media group s main operating costs are employee related costs and raw materials  primarily newsprint

annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents news media group revenues in by category and percentage share are below 
logo about group the about group generates revenues principally from cost per click advertising sponsored links for which the about group is paid when a user clicks on the ad  display advertising and e commerce including sales lead generation 
almost all of its revenues in are derived from the sale of cost per click and display advertising 
cost per click advertising accounted for of the about group s total advertising revenues in the about group s main operating costs are employee related costs and content and hosting costs 
joint ventures our investments accounted for under the equity method are as follows a interest in metro boston  which publishes a free daily newspaper in the greater boston area  a interest in a canadian newsprint company  malbaie  a interest in a partnership  madison  operating a supercalendered paper mill in maine  a interest in quadrantone  an online advertising network that sells bundled premium  targeted display advertising onto local newspaper and other web sites  and a interest in nesv  which owns the boston red sox  fenway park and other real estate  approximately of new england sports network  a regional cable sports network  and of roush fenway racing  a leading nascar team 
we are exploring the possible sale of our interest in nesv 
business environment we believe that a number of factors and industry trends have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on our business and prospects 
these include the following economic conditions the challenging business environment in adversely affected our advertising revenues 
advertising spending  which drives a significant portion of our revenues  is susceptible to economic conditions 
in  the rate of decline in advertising revenues moderated in the fourth quarter  as encouraging signs of improvement were seen in the overall economy 
weak national and local economic conditions  particularly in the new york city and boston metropolitan regions  as well as in florida  affected the levels of our national  classified and retail advertising revenue 
changes in spending patterns and priorities  including shifts in marketing strategies and budget cuts of key advertisers  in response to weak economic conditions  have depressed and may continue to depress our advertising revenue 
secular shift to digital media choices the competition for advertising revenue in various markets has intensified as a result of the continued development of digital media technologies 
we expect that technological developments will continue to favor digital media choices  adding to the challenges posed by audience fragmentation 
we have expanded and will continue to expand our digital offerings  however  most of our revenues are currently from traditional print products where advertising revenues are declining 
we believe that the shift from traditional media forms to a growing number of digital media choices has contributed to  and may continue to contribute to  a decline in print advertising 
in digital advertising  the marketplace has experienced significant downward pressure on advertising rates as a result of significant increases in inventory 
as the advertising climate remains challenged  media companies have been re evaluating their business models  with some moving towards various forms of online paid models that will depend on greater market acceptance and a shift in consumer attitudes 
circulation circulation is another significant source of revenue for us 
circulation revenues are affected by circulation and readership levels 
in recent years  our newspaper properties  and the newspaper industry as a whole  have experienced declining print circulation volume 
this is due to  among other factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the new york times company p 

table of contents increased competition from new media formats and sources other than traditional newspapers often free to users  declining discretionary spending by consumers  higher subscription and newsstand rates and a growing preference among some consumers for receiving all or a portion of their news from a variety of sources 
costs a significant portion of our costs are fixed costs and therefore we are limited in our ability to reduce costs in the short term 
our most significant costs are employee related costs and raw materials  which together accounted for approximately of our total operating costs in changes in employee related costs and the price and availability of newsprint can materially affect our operating results 
for a discussion of these and other factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition  see forward looking statements and item a risk factors 
our strategy we anticipate that the challenges we currently face will continue  and we believe that the following elements are key to our efforts to address them 
extending the reach of our brands we are addressing the increasingly fragmented media landscape by building on the strength of our brands  particularly the times 
because of our high quality content  we believe we have very powerful and trusted brands that attract educated  affluent and influential audiences 
in  we significantly expanded the presence of the times on new digital platforms and added new tools and multimedia features across our properties 
we are also attempting to grow the national circulation of the times by adding local and regional news in certain markets 
strengthening our digital businesses online  our goal is to grow our digital businesses by broadening our audiences  deepening engagement and monetizing the usage of our web sites 
we are pursuing a multiplatform strategy across the company with new digital products and new platforms  such as mobile  social media networks and reader application products 
our internet businesses provide diversified advertising revenue 
nytimes 
com benefits from the large national advertiser base that the times brand attracts and about 
com generates most of its revenues from cost per click and display advertising 
our goal for nytimes 
com is to continue to build a fully interactive news and information platform and to sustain our leadership positions in our most profitable content areas and verticals 
we have made and expect to continue to make investments to grow those areas of our web sites that have the highest advertiser demand 
we are also focused on continuing to offer a premier environment for integrated brand advertising across platforms through online advertising product innovation and our integrated print and online sales structure 
as we continue our transition from a company that operated primarily in print to one that is increasingly digital in focus and multiplatform in delivery  we expect that online advertising revenues will be a more important part of our mix 
in  internet revenue accounted for of our revenues  versus in our research and development group also helps us monitor the changing media and technology landscape so that we can anticipate consumer preferences and devise innovative ways of satisfying them 
diversifying our revenue streams as the advertising marketplace changes  we plan to continue to diversify our revenue streams driven by our desire to achieve additional revenue diversity that will make us less susceptible to the inevitable economic cycles 
print circulation revenue is becoming a more significant part of overall revenues  representing approximately of total revenues in compared to approximately in  and we continue to evaluate our circulation pricing models 
we have seen continued growth in revenue from print circulation  mainly as a result of our strategy of reducing less profitable circulation and increasing prices for subscriptions and newsstand copies of the times and the globe 
in january  we announced that we will introduce a paid model for nytimes 
com at the beginning of to create a second revenue stream while preserving nytimes 
com s robust advertising business 
we plan to implement a metered model that will offer users free access to a set number of articles per month and then charge users who are not subscribers once they exceed that number 
through  we will be building a new online infrastructure designed to provide consumers with a frictionless experience across multiple platforms 
as our news and information are being featured in an increasingly broad range of end user devices and services  p 
annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents we believe that our pricing plans and policies must reflect this vision 
restructuring our cost base we continue to restructure our cost base to ensure that we are operating our businesses as efficiently as possible 
our focus is to realign our cost base  while maintaining the quality of our journalism and achieving our long term strategy 
we reduced our operating costs by approximately million in and by approximately million in and expect that actions taken in will yield additional benefits in we have focused our cost restructuring efforts on the following key areas employee related costs wages and benefits are the single largest component of our operating costs 
in  we reduced the number of full time equivalent employees by  amended our pension plan for non union employees to discontinue future benefit accruals and freeze existing accrued benefits effective december   froze our supplemental executive retirement plan that provided enhanced retirement benefits to select members of management  and reduced health benefits for retirees 
we expect that these changes will produce significant savings and have a long term positive impact on our cost structure 
as we monitor our overall financial health  we remain focused on evaluating all employee related costs 
strategic plan for the globe we responded to the challenges facing the globe by implementing a strategic plan that included consolidating the globe s printing facilities  increasing circulation prices and reducing compensation and headcount 
the strategic plan involved extensive negotiations with the globe s unions on various cost cutting measures  resulting in amendments to most of the collective bargaining agreements in effect for the globe 
as a result of these efforts  the globe has made significant progress 
streamlining operations to increase efficiencies across the company  we have lowered our expense structure by streamlining processes and increasing efficiencies while maintaining the quality of our journalism and focusing our resources where they are most needed 
for example  we have outsourced the editing function of the new york times news services division to the gainesville sun  which is part of our regional media group 
closing city suburban in january  we closed city suburban  which operated a wholesale distribution business that delivered the times and other newspapers and magazines to newsstands and retail outlets in the new york metropolitan area 
the closure improved our operating results in by approximately million  excluding one time costs 
this is a result of a decrease in costs of approximately million to operate city suburban  offset in part by a decrease in revenue of approximately million in other revenues from the elimination of delivering third party publications and in circulation revenue from the sale of the times to wholesale distributors rather than retailers 
managing and rebalancing our portfolio of businesses over the past several years  we have been managing and rebalancing our portfolio of businesses  focusing more on growth areas  such as digital 
we also continue to evaluate our businesses to determine whether they are meeting our targets for financial performance  growth and return on investment and whether they remain relevant to our strategy 
in  we completed the sale of wqxr fm  a new york city radio station  to subsidiaries of univision radio inc and wnyc radio for a total of approximately million 
we also sold the timesdaily  a daily newspaper located in florence  ala  and its web site  timesdaily 
com  for million and divested surplus real estate at the regional media group 
we are exploring the possible sale of our interest in nesv 
despite a difficult operating environment  we are pleased with the significant progress that we have made at the new england media group 
after careful consideration and analysis  we terminated the process of exploring the sale of the globe  boston 
com and related businesses in october and the t g and telegram

evaluating our pension related obligations the funded status of our qualified pension plans has been adversely affected by the current interest rate environment  and required contributions for our qualified pension plans can have a significant impact on future cash flows

table of contents gaap  the underfunded status of our qualified pension plans improved by approximately million from year end for funding purposes on an employee retirement income security act erisa basis  we previously disclosed a january  underfunded status for our qualified pension plans of approximately million 
this funding gap reflected the use of a temporary valuation relief allowed by the us treasury department  applicable only to our january  valuation 
as of january   without the valuation relief  our underfunded status would have been approximately million 
based on preliminary results  we estimate a january  underfunded status of million 
we do not have mandatory contributions to our sponsored qualified plans in due to existing funding credits 
however  we may choose to make discretionary contributions in to address a portion of this funding gap 
we currently expect to make contributions in the range of to million to our sponsored qualified plans  but may adjust this range based on cash flows  pension asset performance  interest rates and other factors 
we also expect to make contributions of approximately to million to the new york times newspaper guild pension plan based on our contractual obligations 
in addition  certain of our cost restructuring efforts created pension withdrawal liabilities  as discussed under other items pension withdrawal expense below 
while the pension withdrawal liabilities we incurred are significant  we believe the cost restructuring measures were an important step to address pension obligations that we projected would otherwise have continued to grow over time 
restructuring debt and improving our liquidity debt restructuring has been a key area of strategic focus 
we have made significant progress in lowering our total debt level through cash flow from operations  divestiture activities  suspension of dividend payments and other actions 
our total debt level at year end decreased to million from billion at the end of in early  we entered into a private financing transaction for million in senior unsecured notes and warrants 
we also raised million by entering into a sale leaseback transaction related to our leasehold condominium interest in our new york headquarters 
these transactions improved our financial flexibility and lengthened our debt profile 
as a result  the majority of our total debt now matures in or later 
we also improved our liquidity by taking other steps  including decreasing capital expenditures to million in  down from million in we remain focused on reducing our total debt 
we plan to do so through the cash we generate from our businesses and the decisive steps we have taken to reduce costs  lower capital spending  suspend our dividend and rebalance our portfolio of assets

newsprint expense declined  with from lower consumption and from lower pricing 
newsprint prices reached a peak in november  and prices have declined significantly since then due to a rapid decline in consumption  causing an oversupply of newsprint in the market 
we believe that prices hit the bottom of the cycle during the third quarter of suppliers have recently announced price increases  the majority of which were implemented in the fourth quarter of we expect newsprint prices to remain under pressure and that further price increases will be dependent on a substantial reduction in capacity to bring newsprint supply and demand more in balance

we recorded a million charge for the present value of estimated future payments under the pension withdrawal liabilities 
our total estimated future payments relating to withdrawal liabilities to these multiemployer plans are approximately million 
these amounts will be adjusted as more information becomes available that will allow us to refine the estimate 
the actual liability will not be known until each plan completes a final assessment of the withdrawal liability and issues a demand to us 
while the exact period over which the payment of these liabilities would be made has not yet been determined  a withdrawal liability is generally paid in installments over a period of time that could extend up to years or beyond in the case of a mass withdrawal

as a result of the purchase and sale  we recognized a net pre tax loss of million in impairment of assets there were no impairment charges in connection with our annual impairment test  which was completed in the fourth quarter 
however  the regional media group s estimated fair value approximates its carrying value 
the regional media group includes approximately million of goodwill 
in determining the fair value of the regional media group  we made significant judgments and estimates regarding the expected severity and duration of the current economic slowdown and the secular changes affecting the newspaper industry 
the effect of these assumptions on projected long term revenues  along with the continued benefits from reductions to the group s cost structure  play a significant role in calculating the fair value of the regional media group 
we estimated a annual growth rate to arrive at a normalized residual year representing the perpetual cash flows of the regional media group 
the residual year cash flow was capitalized to arrive at the terminal value of the regional media group 
utilizing a discount rate of  the present value of the cash flows during the projection period and terminal value were aggregated to estimate the fair value of the regional media group 
we assumed a discount rate of in the discounted cash flow analysis for the annual impairment test compared to a discount rate used in the annual impairment test 
in determining the appropriate discount rate  we considered the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies 
we believe that if the regional media group s projected cash flows are not met during  a goodwill impairment charge could be reasonably likely in in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million charge for a write down of assets due to the reduced scope of a systems project at the news media group 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the write down of assets for a systems project at the news media group 
we reduced the scope of a major advertising and circulation project to decrease capital spending  which resulted in the write down of previously capitalized costs 
in the third quarter of  we performed an interim impairment test at the new england media group  which is part of the news media group reportable segment  due to certain impairment indicators  including the continued decline in print advertising revenue affecting the newspaper industry and lower than expected current and projected operating results 
the assets tested included goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  other long lived assets being amortized and an equity method investment in metro boston 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million 
this impairment charge reduced the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of the new england media group to zero 
the fair value of the new england media group s goodwill was the residual fair value after allocating the total fair value of the new england media group to its other assets  net of liabilities 
the total fair value of the new england media group was estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow model present value of future cash flows and a market approach model based on comparable businesses 
the goodwill was not tax deductible because the acquisition of the globe was structured as a tax free stock transaction 
the fair value of the mastheads at the new england media group was calculated using a relief from royalty method and the fair value of the customer list was calculated by estimating the present value of associated future cash flows 
the property  plant and equipment of the new england media group was estimated at fair value less cost to sell 
the fair value was determined giving consideration to market and income approaches to value

table of contents the carrying value of our investment in metro boston was written down to fair value because the business had experienced lower than expected growth and we anticipated lower growth compared with previous projections  leading management to conclude that the investment was other than temporarily impaired 
the impairment was recorded within net income loss from joint ventures 
our annual impairment test  which was completed in the fourth quarter  resulted in an additional non cash impairment charge of million relating to the iht masthead 
the impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the iht masthead to zero 
the asset impairment mainly resulted from lower projected operating results and cash flows primarily due to the economic downturn and secular decline of print advertising revenues 
the fair value of the masthead was calculated using a relief from royalty method 
in  our annual impairment testing resulted in non cash impairment charges of million related to write downs of intangible assets at the new england media group and our metro boston investment 
the asset impairments mainly resulted from declines in current and projected operating results and cash flows of the new england media group due to  among other factors  unfavorable economic conditions  advertiser consolidations in the new england area and increased competition with online media

ratings in april  standard poor s lowered its rating on our senior unsecured debt to b from bb and placed its rating on negative watch 
in may  standard poor s further lowered its rating to b  citing the effects of declining advertising revenues and operating performance on our leverage 
it also changed its rating outlook from negative to stable  citing our ability to maintain adequate liquidity 
in april  moody s investors service downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b from ba with a negative outlook  citing the expected continued pressure on revenues and operating cash flow as a result of lower newspaper advertising 
we have no liabilities subject to accelerated payment upon a ratings downgrade and do not expect a material increase in our current borrowing costs as a result of these ratings actions 
however  we expect that any future long term borrowings or the extension or replacement of our short term borrowing facility will reflect the impact of our below investment grade ratings  increasing our borrowing costs  limiting our financing options  including limiting our access to the unsecured borrowing market  and subjecting us to more restrictive covenants appropriate for non investment grade issuers 
additional reductions in our credit ratings could further increase our borrowing costs  subject us to more onerous terms and reduce our borrowing flexibility in the future

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe our critical accounting policies include our accounting for long lived assets  retirement benefits  stock based compensation  income taxes  self insurance liabilities and accounts receivable allowances 
additional information about these policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
specific risks related to our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
long lived assets we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets not amortized on an annual basis or in an interim period if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist 
all other long lived assets are tested for impairment if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment exists 
in millions december  december  long lived assets total assets percentage of long lived assets to total assets the impairment analysis is considered critical to our segments because of the significance of long lived assets to our consolidated balance sheets 
p 
annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  which are our operating segments 
separate financial information about these segments is regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value is calculated by a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach model 
in calculating fair value for each reporting unit  we generally weigh the results of the discounted cash flow model more heavily than the market approach because the discounted cash flow model is specific to our business and long term projections 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions  many of which are interdependent  about future revenues  operating margins  growth rates  capital expenditures  working capital and discount rates 
the starting point for the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis is the annual long range financial forecast 
the annual planning process that we undertake to prepare the long range financial forecast takes into consideration a multitude of factors including historical growth rates and operating performance  related industry trends  macroeconomic conditions  and marketplace data  among others 
assumptions are also made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long range financial forecast period 
our estimates of fair value are sensitive to changes in all of these variables  certain of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside our control 
the market approach analysis includes applying a multiple  based on comparable market transactions  to certain operating metrics of the reporting unit 
we compare the sum of the fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization to determine whether our estimates of reporting unit fair value are reasonable 
intangible assets that are not amortized trade names are tested for impairment at the asset level by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
fair value is calculated utilizing the relief from royalty method  which is based on applying a royalty rate  which would be obtained through a lease  to the cash flows derived from the asset being tested 
the royalty rate is derived from market data 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the asset is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset 
all other long lived assets intangible assets that are amortized  such as customer lists  as well as property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment at the asset group level associated with the lowest level of cash flows 
an impairment exists if the carrying value of the asset i is not recoverable the carrying value of the asset is greater than the sum of undiscounted cash flows and ii is greater than its fair value 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  other intangible assets acquired and other long lived assets are estimated future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates  as well as other factors 
any changes in these estimates or assumptions could result in an impairment charge 
the estimates  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated results of the impairment tests can vary within a range of outcomes 
in addition to annual testing  management uses certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying values of our long lived assets may not be recoverable and an interim impairment test may be required 
these indicators include i current period operating or cash flow declines combined with a history of operating or cash flow declines or a projection forecast that demonstrates continuing declines in cash flow or an inability to improve our operations to forecasted levels  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate  whether structural or technological and iii a decline in our stock price and market capitalization 
management has applied what it believes to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for its impairment testing

table of contents retirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are accounted for using actuarial valuations 
we are required to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit plans measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation on the balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost  within other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
as of december   our assets related to our qualified pension plans were measured at fair value 
we consider accounting for retirement plans critical to all of our operating segments because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets and mortality rates 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the impact from our pension and other postretirement benefits could vary within a range of outcomes and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see pensions and other postretirement benefits below for more information on our retirement benefits 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  and for certain awards at the end of each reporting period based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stock based compensation expense 
income taxes we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
income taxes are recognized for the following i amount of taxes payable for the current year and ii deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes in the period of enactment 
we are also required to assess whether deferred tax assets shall be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our process includes collecting positive eg  sources of taxable income and negative eg  recent historical losses evidence and assessing  based on the evidence  whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions  the evaluation of tax law and an assessment of whether a liability for uncertain tax positions is necessary 
different conclusions reached in this assessment can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which could require an extended period of time to resolve 
until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities  the timing and amount of a possible audit settlement for uncertain tax benefits is difficult to predict 
self insurance we self insure for workers compensation costs  certain employee medical and disability benefits  and automobile and general liability claims

this funding gap reflected the use of a temporary valuation relief allowed by the us treasury department  applicable only to our january  valuation 
as of january   without the valuation relief  our underfunded status would have been approximately million

table of contents based on preliminary results  we estimate a january  underfunded status of million 
we do not have mandatory contributions to our sponsored qualified plans in due to existing funding credits 
however  we may choose to make discretionary contributions in to address a portion of this funding gap 
we currently expect to make contributions in the range of to million to our sponsored qualified plans  but may adjust this range based on operating cash flows  pension asset performance  interest rates and other factors 
we also expect to make contributions of approximately to million to the new york times newspaper guild pension plan based on our contractual obligations 
pension expense is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets for qualified plans and a discount rate 
our methodology in selecting these actuarial assumptions is discussed below 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on assets  we evaluated input from our investment consultants  actuaries and investment management firms  including their review of asset class return expectations  as well as long term historical asset class returns 
projected returns by such consultants and economists are based on broad equity and bond indices 
the expected long term rate of return determined on this basis was in we anticipate that our pension assets will generate long term returns on assets of at least 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of to with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return on assets of  and to with fixed income real estate managers  with an expected long term rate of return on assets of 
our actual asset allocation as of december  was in line with our expectations 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
our plan assets had a rate of return of approximately in we believe that an expected long term rate of return of is reasonable 
if we had decreased our expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million in for our qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
in and  we determined our discount rate using a ryan alm  inc curve ryan curve 
the ryan curve was not available prior to  when we utilized the citigroup pension discount curve 
we switched to the ryan curve because it provides the bonds included in the curve and allows adjustments for certain outliers eg  bonds on watch 
we believe that this additional information and flexibility allows us to calculate a better estimate of a discount rate 
to determine our discount rate  we project a cash flow based on annual accrued benefits 
for active participants  the benefits under the respective pension plans are projected to the date of termination 
the projected plan cash flow is discounted to the measurement date  which is the last day of our fiscal year  using the annual spot rates provided in the ryan curve 
a single discount rate is then computed so that the present value of the benefit cash flow on a projected benefit obligation basis as described above equals the present value computed using the ryan curve rates 
the discount rate determined on this basis was for our qualified plans and for our non qualified plans as of december  if we had decreased the expected discount rate by in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million for our qualified pension plans and approximately million for our non qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
we will continue to evaluate all of our actuarial assumptions  generally on an annual basis  and will adjust as necessary 
actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates  the level of contributions we make and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans 
other postretirement benefits we provide health benefits to retired employees and their eligible dependents who are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements  if the employees meet specified age and service requirements 
we no longer provide post age retiree medical benefits for employees who retire on or after march  we also contribute to a postretirement plan p 
annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement 
we accrue the costs of postretirement benefits during the employees active years of service and our policy is to pay our portion of insurance premiums and claims from our assets 
the annual postretirement expense was calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including a health care cost trend rate and a discount rate 
the health care cost trend rate range decreased to to as of december   from to as of december  a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates range would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million in our service and interest costs  respectively  two factors included in the calculation of postretirement expense 
a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million  in our accumulated benefit obligation as of december  our discount rate assumption for postretirement benefits is consistent with that used in the calculation of pension benefits
