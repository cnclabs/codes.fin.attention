general overview arch capital group ltd 
acgl and  together with its subsidiaries  we or us is a bermuda public limited liability company with over billion in capital at december  and  through operations in bermuda  the united states  europe and canada  writes insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis 
while we are positioned to provide a full range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines  we focus on writing specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance 
it is our belief that our underwriting platform  our experienced management team and our strong capital base that is unencumbered by significant pre risks have enabled us to establish a strong presence in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
the worldwide insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive and has traditionally been subject to an underwriting cycle in which a hard market high premium rates  restrictive underwriting standards  as well as terms and conditions  and underwriting gains is eventually followed by a soft market low premium rates  relaxed underwriting standards  as well as broader terms and conditions  and underwriting losses 
insurance market conditions may affect  among other things  the demand for our products  our ability to increase premium rates  the terms and conditions of the insurance policies we write  changes in the products offered by us or changes in our business strategy 
the financial results of the insurance and reinsurance industry are influenced by factors such as the frequency and or severity of claims and losses  including natural disasters or other catastrophic events  variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in the legal  regulatory and judicial environments  inflationary pressures and general economic conditions 
these factors influence  among other things  the demand for insurance or reinsurance  the supply of which is generally related to the total capital of competitors in the market 
the weather related catastrophic events that occurred in the second half of caused significant industry losses and led to a strengthening of rating agency capital requirements for catastrophe exposed business 
the events also resulted in substantial improvements in market conditions in property and certain marine lines of business and slowed declines in premium rates in other lines 
during and  excellent industry results led to a significant increase in capacity  competition intensified and  in general  prices declined in all lines of business 
during and  we increased our writings in property and certain marine lines of business in order to take advantage of market conditions and these lines represented a larger proportion of our overall book of business than in prior periods 

table of contents current outlook during the second half of  the financial markets experienced significant adverse credit events and a loss of liquidity  which have reduced the amount and availability of capital in the insurance industry 
in addition  certain of our competitors have experienced significant financial difficulties 
during the first six months of  we experienced rate stabilization and some improvements in rates 
however  with no significant catastrophic activity in the third quarter and substantial improvements in market values across most investment sectors  the degree of rate improvement we saw in the first six months of was moderated and the pricing environment is basically unchanged 
the current economic conditions could continue to have a material impact on the frequency and severity of claims and therefore could negatively impact our underwriting returns 
in addition  volatility in the financial markets could continue to significantly affect our investment returns  reported results and shareholders equity 
we consider the potential impact of economic trends in the estimation process for establishing unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and in determining our investment strategies 
we continue to believe that the most attractive area from a pricing point of view remains us catastrophe exposed business 
we expect that our writings in this business will continue to represent a significant proportion of our overall book  which could increase the volatility of our operating results 
natural catastrophe risk we monitor our natural catastrophe risk globally for all perils and regions  in each case  where we believe there is significant exposure 
our models employ both proprietary and vendor based systems and include cross line correlations for property  marine  offshore energy  aviation  workers compensation and personal accident 
currently  we seek to limit our in year return period net probable maximum pre tax loss from a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone to approximately of total shareholders equity 
we reserve the right to change this threshold at any time 
based on in force exposure estimated as of january   our modeled peak zone catastrophe exposure is a hurricane affecting the florida tri county area  with a net probable maximum pre tax loss of million  compared to million as of october  our exposures to other perils  such as us earthquake and international events  are less than the exposures arising from us hurricanes 
as of january   our modeled peak zone earthquake exposure los angeles area earthquake represented less than of our peak zone hurricane exposure  and our modeled peak zone international exposure united kingdom windstorm is substantially less than both our peak zone hurricane and earthquake exposures 
net probable maximum pre tax loss estimates are net of expected reinsurance recoveries  before income tax and before excess reinsurance reinstatement premiums 
loss estimates are reflective of the zone indicated and not the entire portfolio 
since hurricanes and windstorms can affect more than one zone and make multiple landfalls  our loss estimates include clash estimates from other zones 
the loss estimates shown above do not represent our maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates 
there can be no assurances that we will not suffer a net loss greater than of our total shareholders equity from one or more catastrophic events due to several factors  including the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques or as a result of a decision to change the percentage of shareholders equity exposed to a single catastrophic event 
in addition  actual losses may increase if our reinsurers fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance protections purchased by us are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable

table of contents financial measures management uses the following three key financial indicators in evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for acgl s common shareholders 
book value per common share book value per common share represents total common shareholders equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding 
management uses growth in book value per common share as a key measure of the value generated for our common shareholders each period and believes that book value per common share is the key driver of acgl s share price over time 
book value per common share is impacted by  among other factors  our underwriting results  investment returns and share repurchase activity  which has an accretive or dilutive impact on book value per common share depending on the purchase price 
book value per common share was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the growth in was generated through the underwriting results of our insurance and reinsurance operations and investment returns which reflected recoveries in value across most asset classes 
from december  to  book value per common share increased by an average of 
operating return on average common equity operating return on average common equity operating roae represents after tax operating income available to common shareholders divided by the average of beginning and ending common shareholders equity during the period 
after tax operating income available to common shareholders  a non gaap measure as defined in the sec rules  represents net income available to common shareholders  excluding net realized gains or losses  net impairment losses recognized in earnings  equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses  net of income taxes 
management uses operating roae as a key measure of the return generated to common shareholders and has set an objective to achieve an average operating roae of or greater over the insurance cycle  which it believes to be an attractive return to common shareholders given the risks we assume 
see comment on non gaap financial measures 
our operating roae was for  compared to for and for the operating roae for benefitted from a lower level of catastrophic events than in the period  partially offset by the impact of declining interest yields and current insurance market conditions 
total return on investments total return on investments includes net investment income  equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method  net realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by our investment portfolio 
total return is calculated on a pre tax basis and before investment expenses and includes the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations 
management uses total return on investments as a key measure of the return generated to common shareholders on the capital held in the business  and compares the return generated by our investment portfolio against benchmark returns which we measured our portfolio against during the periods 
the benchmark return is a weighted average of the benchmarks assigned to each of our investment managers and vary based on the nature of the portfolios under management 
for  and  set forth below is the pre tax total return before investment expenses of our investment portfolio including fixed maturities  short term investments and fixed maturities and short term investments pledged under securities lending agreements compared to the benchmark 
table of contents return against which we measured our portfolio during the year 
our investment expenses were approximately of average invested assets in  compared to in and in arch portfolio benchmark return pre tax total return before investment expenses year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  comment on non gaap financial measures throughout this filing  we present our operations in the way we believe will be the most meaningful and useful to investors  analysts  rating agencies and others who use our financial information in evaluating the performance of our company 
this presentation includes the use of after tax operating income available to common shareholders  which is defined as net income available to common shareholders  excluding net realized gains or losses  net impairment losses included in earnings  equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses  net of income taxes 
the presentation of after tax operating income available to common shareholders is a non gaap financial measure as defined in regulation g 
the reconciliation of such measure to net income available to common shareholders the most directly comparable gaap financial measure in accordance with regulation g is included under results of operations below 
we believe that net realized gains or losses  net impairment losses included in earnings  equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses in any particular period are not indicative of the performance of  or trends in  our business 
although net realized gains or losses  net impairment losses included in earnings  equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses are an integral part of our operations  the decision to realize investment gains or losses  the recognition of net impairment losses  the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and the recognition of foreign exchange gains or losses are independent of the insurance underwriting process and result  in large part  from general economic and financial market conditions 
furthermore  certain users of our financial information believe that  for many companies  the timing of the realization of investment gains or losses is largely opportunistic 
in addition  net impairment losses included in earnings on our investments represent other than temporary declines in expected recovery values on securities without actual realization 
the use of the equity method on certain of our investments in certain funds that invest in fixed maturity securities is driven by the ownership structure of such funds either limited partnerships or limited liability companies 
in applying the equity method  these investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on our proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds which include changes in the market value of the underlying securities in the funds 
this method of accounting is different from the way we account for our other fixed maturity securities and the timing of the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method may differ from gains or losses in the future upon sale or maturity of such investments 
due to these reasons  we exclude net realized gains or losses  equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses from the calculation of after tax operating income available to common shareholders 
we believe that showing net income available to common shareholders exclusive of the items referred to above reflects the underlying fundamentals of our business since we evaluate the performance of and manages our business to produce an underwriting profit 
in addition to presenting 
table of contents net income available to common shareholders  we believe that this presentation enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance 
we also believe that this measure follows industry practice and  therefore  allows the users of financial information to compare our performance with our industry peer group 
we believe that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies which follow us and the insurance industry as a whole generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons

the components of the insurance segment s underwriting income or loss are discussed below 
premiums written 
versus gross premiums written by the insurance segment in were higher than  with growth in executive assurance  national accounts casualty  property  and travel and accident business  primarily resulting from new business  in addition to renewal rate increases for the executive assurance business 
such growth was largely offset by reductions in casualty  surety  professional liability  and other business  as the insurance segment continued to maintain underwriting discipline in response to the current market environment 
in addition  the program business experienced growth resulting from new business 
however  such growth in the program business was offset by a reduction resulting from million of premium adjustments related to involuntary pools in the period million on an earned basis 
net premiums written increased by  reflecting changes in the mix of business noted above  reinstatement premiums and the impact of changes in reinsurance structure

net premiums earned by the insurance segment in decreased from losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the table below shows the components of the insurance segment s loss ratio years ended december  current year prior period reserve development loss ratio current year loss ratio 
versus the insurance segment s current year loss ratio was points lower in compared to  primarily due to the lack of any significant catastrophic event activity in  while the current year loss ratio included points of catastrophic activity  primarily hurricanes gustav and ike 
the loss ratio also reflected increases in expected loss ratios across a number of lines of business  primarily due to the anticipated impact of rate changes  partially offset by a lower level of large  specific risk loss activity and changes in the mix of business 
versus the insurance segment s current year loss ratio was points higher in compared to  primarily due to the points of catastrophic activity in and large  specific risk loss activity during  while the current year loss ratio did not include any significant catastrophic activity 
prior period reserve development 
prior period reserve development the insurance segment s net favorable development of million  or points  was primarily due to reductions in reserves in medium tailed and short tailed lines of business 
such amount included favorable development in professional liability reserves from the to accident years ie  the year in which a loss occurred of million  million and million  respectively  and adverse development on the accident year of million 
in addition  favorable development on construction reserves from the and accident years contributed million and million  respectively  which resulted from lower than expected large loss activity 
favorable development in short tailed lines primarily consisted of reductions in property reserves from the and accident years of million and million  respectively 
offsetting favorable development on medium tailed and short tailed lines of business were increases in executive assurance reserves for the and accident years of million and million  respectively  due to large specific risk loss activity relating to the credit crisis  partially offset by favorable development in the to accident years of million  million and million  respectively 
reductions in the to accident years relate to less large loss activity than expected in commercial d o  a distinctive downward trend in security class action cases filed from through  and to the claims made nature of the coverage 
the claims made aspect 
table of contents eliminates the potential of new claims being reported for these years  and narrows the remaining liability to changes in reserve estimation for claims which have already been reported 
prior period reserve development the insurance segment s net favorable development of million  or points  was primarily due to reductions in reserves in medium tailed and long tailed lines of business 
over percent of this development is related to the executive assurance and professional liability lines of business 
executive assurance reserves developed favorably for accident years through by million  million  and million  respectively 
these reductions relate to less large loss activity than expected in commercial d o  a distinctive downward trend in security class action cases filed from through  and to the claims made nature of the coverage 
accident year experienced unfavorable development of million relating to the re evaluation of claims given additional information available during regarding the impact of the credit crisis 
reserves for professional liability developed favorably as well  with the majority of the favorable development relating to accident years through with million  million  and million  respectively

these reductions relate to less large loss activity than expected  the downward trend in security class action cases filed from through for executive assurance  and to the claims made nature of these coverages 
adverse development on short tailed lines primarily resulted from a million increase in surety reserves in the accident year due to large  specific risk loss activity  which was partially offset by reductions in the and accident years of million and million  respectively  which was partially offset by reductions in property reserves in the and accident years of million and million  respectively 
such amount was partially offset by reductions in property reserves in the and accident years of million and million  respectively  due to lower than expected large loss activity in the property and marine units 
underwriting expenses

before reinsurance  such estimated losses were million 
the components of the reinsurance segment s underwriting income are discussed below 
premiums written 
versus gross premiums written by the reinsurance segment in were lower than  primarily due to reductions in casualty  marine and aviation  and other specialty business 
the decrease in casualty and marine and aviation business resulted from the impact of non renewals of a number of contracts and contract participation decreases  while the lower level of other specialty business was due to the non renewal of a non standard auto treaty in addition to impacts of non renewals and contract participation decreases 
the decreases were partially offset by increases in property business which resulted from new business  the renewal of a two year treaty  and a million increase in writings by the reinsurance segment s property facultative operation

such amount included reductions in to underwriting years of million  million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  favorable development in short tailed lines included million from other specialty business  including million and million from the and underwriting years 
the reduction of loss estimates for the reinsurance segment s short tailed lines primarily resulted from a lower level of reported and paid claims activity than previously anticipated which led to decreases in certain loss ratio selections during net favorable development of million in long tailed lines included reductions in casualty reserves of million  million and million from the to underwriting years which primarily resulted from a lower level of reported and paid claims activity than previously anticipated on us and international excess liability  professional liability and d o lines 
over time  historical loss information for older underwriting years has been given more weight in the reinsurance segment s reserving process based on the continued maturation of its reserves 
adverse development on medium tailed lines resulted from increases on marine exposures in the underwriting year of million  due in part to increases in hurricane ike estimates  partially offset by reductions in the to underwriting years

in addition  favorable development in short tailed lines reflected million of favorable development in other specialty business  including million  million and million from the to underwriting years  respectively  with the remainder attributable to earlier underwriting years 
the reduction of loss estimates for the reinsurance segment s short tailed lines primarily resulted from a lower level of reported and paid claims activity than previously anticipated which led to decreases in certain loss ratio selections during the net favorable development of million in medium tailed and long tailed lines was primarily in casualty reserves from the to underwriting years  which contributed million  million and million  respectively

the comparability of net investment income between the and periods was influenced by our share repurchase program  as well as the decrease in the pre tax investment income yield  due in part to the prevailing interest rate environment and a reduction of the portfolio s effective duration to years at december   compared to years at december  the increase in net investment income in from primarily resulted from a higher level of average invested assets primarily generated by cash flows from operations  partially offset by share repurchase activity during and a decrease in the pre tax investment income yield

the and amounts primarily related to our investments in us and euro denominated bank loan funds and was impacted by the use of leverage to achieve a higher rate of return 
while leverage presents opportunities for increasing the total return of such investments  it may increase losses as well 
accordingly  any event that adversely affects the value of the underlying securities held by such investments would be magnified to the extent leverage is used and our potential losses from such investments would be magnified 
losses during resulted from the extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets as the market values of the secured loans underlying the holdings in such funds declined significantly

net realized gains or losses net realized gains losses were as follows  excluding other than temporary impairment provisions years ended december  fixed maturities other investments other total primarily consists of net realized gains or losses related to investment related derivatives  futures contracts  and foreign currency forward contracts 
currently  our portfolio is actively managed to maximize total return within certain guidelines 
in assessing returns under this approach  we include net investment income  net realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by our investment portfolio

total return on our portfolio under management for was  compared to for and for excluding foreign exchange  total return was for  compared to for and for total return is calculated on a pre tax basis and before investment expenses 
the lower total return in compared to and was primarily due to the widening credit spreads which occurred during the last half of  along with the impact of foreign exchange rate changes 
for all periods presented  net realized gains or losses from the sale of fixed maturities primarily resulted from our decisions to reduce credit exposure  changes in duration targets  relative value determinations and sales related to rebalancing the portfolio

we recorded realized gains of million on such securities in  compared to realized losses of million in net impairment losses recognized in earnings we review our investment portfolio each quarter to determine if declines in market value are other than temporary 
the process for identifying declines in the market value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i an analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  ii the time period in which there was a significant decline in value  and iii the significance of the decline

on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  insurance and other reserves  reinsurance recoverables  allowance for doubtful accounts  investment valuations  intangible assets  bad debts  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where possible  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  like our company  are even more difficult to make than those made in a mature company since relatively limited historical information has been reported to us through december  actual results will differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations and gaap to establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses loss reserves that arise from the business we underwrite 
loss reserves for our insurance and reinsurance operations are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured events which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
loss reserves do not reflect contingency reserve allowances to account for future loss occurrences 
losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial 

table of contents at december  and  our loss reserves  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  by type and by operating segment were as follows december  insurance case reserves ibnr reserves total net reserves reinsurance case reserves additional case reserves ibnr reserves total net reserves total case reserves additional case reserves ibnr reserves total net reserves insurance operations loss reserves for our insurance operations are comprised of estimated amounts for claims reported case reserves and incurred but not reported ibnr losses 
for our insurance operations  generally  claims personnel determine whether to establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate settlement of individual claims 
the estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general corporate reserving practices  the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim and  where appropriate  advice of counsel 
our insurance operations also contract with a number of outside third party administrators in the claims process who  in certain cases  have limited authority to establish case reserves 
the work of such administrators is reviewed and monitored by our claims personnel 
loss reserves are also established to provide for loss adjustment expenses and represent the estimated expense of settling claims  including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
periodically  adjustments to the reported or case reserves may be made as additional information regarding the claims is reported or payments are made 
ibnr reserves are established to provide for incurred claims which have not yet been reported to an insurer or reinsurer at the balance sheet date as well as to adjust for any projected variance in case reserving 
ibnr reserves are derived by subtracting paid losses and loss adjustment expenses and case reserves from estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses 
actuaries estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information 
like case reserves  ibnr reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
the process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
in forecasting ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to any line of business  past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource  developed through both industry and company experience  but cannot be relied upon in isolation 
uncertainties in 
table of contents estimating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short usually several months up to a few years 
the claim tail for certain professional liability  executive assurance and healthcare coverages  which are generally written on a claims made basis  is typically longer than property coverages but shorter than casualty lines 
the claim tail for liability casualty coverages  such as general liability  products liability  multiple peril coverage  and workers compensation  may be especially long as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years  even decades  after the related loss events occur 
during the long claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends  may become known and  as a result  our insurance operations may adjust their reserves 
if management determines that an adjustment is appropriate  the adjustment is recorded in the accounting period in which such determination is made in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  should loss reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted  respectively 
in determining ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses  the cost to indemnify claimants  provide needed legal defense and other services for insureds and administer the investigation and adjustment of claims are considered 
these claim costs are influenced by many factors that change over time  such as expanded coverage definitions as a result of new court decisions  inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property  inflation in the cost of medical services and legislated changes in statutory benefits  as well as by the particular  unique facts that pertain to each claim 
as a result  the rate at which claims arose in the past and the costs to settle them may not always be representative of what will occur in the future 
the factors influencing changes in claim costs are often difficult to isolate or quantify and developments in paid and incurred losses from historical trends are frequently subject to multiple and conflicting interpretations 
changes in coverage terms or claims handling practices may also cause future experience and or development patterns to vary from the past 
a key objective of actuaries in developing estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses  and resulting ibnr reserves  is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them so that the future can be projected reliably 
because of the factors previously discussed  this process requires the substantial use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain 
at december  and  loss reserves for our insurance operations by major line of business  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  were as follows december  casualty executive assurance property  energy  marine and aviation professional liability programs construction healthcare surety national accounts casualty travel and accident other total net reserves 
table of contents the initial reserving method for our insurance operations to date has been  to a large extent  the expected loss method  which is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists 
our insurance operations employ a number of different reserving methods depending on the line of business  the availability of historical loss experience and the stability of that loss experience 
over time  such techniques have been given more weight in the reserving process due to the continuing maturation of their loss reserves and the increased availability and credibility of the historical experience 
any estimates and assumptions made as part of the reserving process could prove to be inaccurate due to several factors  including the fact that relatively limited historical information has been reported to our insurance operations through december  in some lines of business 
see below for a discussion of the key assumptions in our insurance operations reserving process 
although loss reserves are initially determined based on underwriting and pricing analysis  our insurance operations apply several generally accepted actuarial methods  as discussed below  on a quarterly basis to evaluate their loss reserves  in addition to the expected loss method  in particular for loss reserves from more mature accident years the year in which a loss occurred 
as noted below  beginning in  our insurance operations began to give a relatively small amount of weight to their own experience following reviews of open claims on lines of business written on a claims made basis for which they developed a reasonable level of credible data 
each quarter  as part of the reserving process  actuaries at our insurance operations reaffirm that the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a sound basis for the projection of liabilities 
if actual loss activity differs substantially from expectations based on historical information  an adjustment to loss reserves may be supported 
estimated loss reserves for more mature accident years are now based more on historical loss activity and patterns than on the initial assumptions based on pricing indications 
more recent accident years rely more heavily on internal pricing assumptions 
our insurance operations place more or less reliance on a particular actuarial method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the estimates of loss reserves are made 
these methods generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories expected loss methods these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios are typically developed based upon the information derived by underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business  supplemented by industry data available from organizations  such as statistical bureaus and consulting firms  where appropriate 
these ratios consider  among other things  rate increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
expected loss methods are useful for estimating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses in the early years of long tailed lines of business  when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available  and is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists for a company 
historical incurred loss development methods these methods assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future 
these methods use incurred losses ie  the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical incurred loss development methods may be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims 
however  historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time 
therefore  when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established  using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses may be less reliable than other methods 
historical paid loss development methods these methods  like historical incurred loss development methods  assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant 
these methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to 
table of contents estimate future losses and necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past  such as inflation or the effects of litigation  will remain constant in the future 
because historical paid loss development methods do not use incurred losses to estimate ultimate losses  they may be more reliable than the other methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how incurred losses are established by a company s claims adjusters 
however  historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses than actuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts 
in addition  and for similar reasons  historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of changes from the past in factors such as inflation  the speed of claim payments or the adequacy of case reserves 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses in periods of significant change  provided the actuaries can develop methods to reasonably quantify the impact of changes 
as such  these methods utilize more judgment than historical paid and incurred loss development methods 
bornhuetter ferguson b f paid and incurred loss methods these methods utilize actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses  taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of expected ultimate losses 
the b f paid and incurred loss methods are useful when there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses 
additional analyses other methodologies are often used in the reserving process for specific types of claims or events  such as catastrophic or other specific major events 
these include vendor catastrophe models  which are typically used in the estimation of loss reserves at the early stage of known catastrophic events before information has been reported to an insurer or reinsurer  and analyses of specific industry events  such as large lawsuits or claims 
in the initial reserving process for casualty business  primarily consisting of primary and excess exposures written on an occurrence basis  our insurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
the development of our insurance operations casualty business may be unstable due to its long tail nature and the occurrence of high severity events  as a portion of our insurance operations casualty business is in high excess layers 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
our insurance operations make a number of key assumptions in reserving for casualty business  including that the pricing loss ratio is the best estimate of the ultimate loss ratio at the time the policy is entered into  that our insurance operations loss development patterns  which are based on industry loss development patterns and adjusted to reflect differences in our insurance operations mix of business  are reasonable and that our insurance operations claims personnel and underwriters analyses of our exposure to major events are assumed to be our best estimate of our exposure to the known claims on those events 
as noted earlier  due to the long claims reporting and settlement period for casualty business  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends may become known and  as a result  our insurance operations may be required to adjust their casualty reserves 
the expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for our insurance operations casualty business for recent accident years have varied  in some cases significantly  from earlier accident years 
as the credibility of historical experience for earlier accident years increases  the experience from these accident years will 
table of contents be given a greater weighting in the actuarial analysis to determine future accident year expected loss ratios  adjusted for changes in pricing  loss trends  terms and conditions and reinsurance structure 
in the initial reserving process for property  energy  marine and aviation business  which are primarily short tail exposures  our insurance operations rely on a combination of the reserving methods discussed above 
for catastrophe exposed business  our insurance operations reserving process also includes the usage of catastrophe models for known events and a heavy reliance on analysis of individual catastrophic events and management judgment 
the development of property losses can be unstable  especially for policies characterized by high severity  low frequency losses 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
our insurance operations make a number of key assumptions in their reserving process  including that historical paid and reported development patterns are stable  catastrophe models provide useful information about our exposure to catastrophic events that have occurred and our underwriters judgment as to potential loss exposures can be relied on 
the expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for our insurance operations property business have varied over time due to changes in pricing  reinsurance structure  estimates of catastrophe losses  policy changes such as attachment points  class and limits and geographical distribution 
as losses in property lines are reported relatively quickly  expected loss ratios are selected for the current accident year based upon actual attritional loss ratios for earlier accident years  adjusted for rate changes  inflation  changes in reinsurance programs and expected attritional losses based on modeling 
due to the short tail nature of property business  reported loss experience emerges quickly and ultimate losses are known in a reasonably short period of time 
in addition to the assumptions and development characteristics noted above for casualty and property business  our insurance operations authorize managing general agents  general agents and other producers to write program business on their behalf within prescribed underwriting authorities 
this adds additional complexity to the reserving process 
to monitor adherence to the underwriting guidelines given to such parties  our insurance operations periodically perform claims due diligence reviews 
in the initial reserving process for program business  consisting of property and liability exposures which are primarily written on an occurrence basis  our insurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
the expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for our insurance operations program business have varied over time depending on the type of exposures written casualty or property and changes in pricing  loss trends  reinsurance structure and changes in the underlying business 
in the initial reserving process for executive assurance  professional liability and healthcare business  primarily consisting of medium tail exposures written on a claims made basis  our insurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
beginning in  our insurance operations began to give a relatively small amount of weight to their own experience following reviews of open claims  in particular for lines of business written on a claims made basis for which they developed a reasonable level of credible data 
over the last few years  our insurance operations have increased their reliance on reviews of open claims 
in general  the expected loss ratios established for executive assurance  professional liability and healthcare business for recent accident years vary  in some cases materially  from earlier accident years based on analysis of pricing  loss cost trends and changes in policy coverage 
since this business is primarily written on a claims made basis and is subject to high severity  low frequency losses  a great deal of uncertainty exists in setting these initial reserves 
in addition  only a limited number of years of historical experience is available for use in projecting 
table of contents loss experience using standard actuarial methods 
as the credibility of historical experience for earlier accident years increases  the experience from these accident years will be given a greater weighting in the actuarial analysis to determine future accident year expected loss ratios  adjusted for the occurrence or lack of large losses  changes in pricing  loss trends  terms and conditions and reinsurance structure 
in the initial reserving process for construction and surety business  consisting of primary and excess casualty and contract surety coverages written on an occurrence and claims made basis  our insurance operations primarily rely on a combination of the reserving methods discussed above 
such business is subject to the assumptions and development characteristics noted above for casualty business 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight has been given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
in general  the expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for our insurance operations construction and surety business for recent accident years vary  in some cases materially  from earlier accident years 
as the credibility of historical experience for earlier accident years has increased  the experience from these accident years has been given a greater weighting in the actuarial analysis to determine future accident year expected loss ratios  adjusted for anticipated changes in the regulatory environment  pricing  loss trends  terms and conditions and reinsurance structure 
for the years ended december  to  on average  our insurance segment reported approximately million of estimated net favorable development in prior year loss reserves  or approximately of average beginning loss reserves 
of such amount  approximately million came from medium tail lines  or of beginning medium tail loss reserves and million from long tail lines  or of average beginning long tail loss reserves  offset partially by adverse development of million from short tail lines  or of average beginning short tail loss reserves 
for the year ended december   estimated net favorable development in prior year loss reserves was approximately million  or of beginning loss reserves 
such amount consisted of approximately million from medium tail lines  or of beginning medium tail loss reserves  and million from short tail lines  or of beginning short tail loss reserves  partially offset by adverse development of million from long tail lines  or of beginning long tail loss reserves 
for informational purposes  based on historical results  applying the average estimated net favorable development in average beginning loss reserves for the years ended december  to to our insurance segment s net loss reserves of billion at december  would result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately million  or per diluted share  and applying the of estimated net favorable development in beginning loss reserves for the year ended december  to such loss reserves would result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately million  or per diluted share 
the amounts noted above are informational only and should not be considered projections of future events 
future favorable or adverse development in our insurance segment s loss reserves is subject to numerous factors  and no assurances can be given that we will experience favorable development in our loss reserves or that our ultimate losses will not be significantly different than the amounts shown above  and such differences could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined 
because of our insurance segment s limited operating history  the sensitivity analysis above is one way to gauge the impact of changes in the assumptions in our reserving process

reinsurance operations loss reserves for our reinsurance operations are comprised of case reserves for claims reported  additional case reserves acrs and ibnr reserves 
our reinsurance operations 
table of contents receive reports of claims notices from ceding companies and record case reserves based upon the amount of reserves recommended by the ceding company 
case reserves on known events may be supplemented by acrs  which are often estimated by our reinsurance operations claims personnel ahead of official notification from the ceding company  or when our reinsurance operations judgment regarding the size or severity of the known event differs from the ceding company 
in certain instances  our reinsurance operations establish acrs even when the ceding company does not report any liability on a known event 
in addition  specific claim information reported by ceding companies or obtained through claim audits can alert our reinsurance operations to emerging trends such as changing legal interpretations of coverage and liability  claims from unexpected sources or classes of business  and significant changes in the frequency or severity of individual claims 
such information is often used in the process of estimating ibnr reserves 
the estimation of loss reserves for our reinsurance operations is subject to the same risk factors as the estimation of loss reserves for our insurance operations 
in addition  the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for reinsurers  due primarily to the following factors the claim tail for reinsurers is generally longer because claims are first reported to the ceding company and then to the reinsurer through one or more intermediaries  the reliance on premium estimates  where reports have not been received from the ceding company  in the reserving process  the potential for writing a number of reinsurance contracts with different ceding companies with the same exposure to a single loss event  the diversity of loss development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and the differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
as with our insurance operations  the process of estimating loss reserves for our reinsurance operations involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
as discussed above  such uncertainty is greater for reinsurers compared to insurers 
as a result  our reinsurance operations obtain information from numerous sources to assist in the process 
pricing actuaries from our reinsurance operations devote considerable effort to understanding and analyzing a ceding company s operations and loss history during the underwriting of the business  using a combination of ceding company and industry statistics 
such statistics normally include historical premium and loss data by class of business  individual claim information for larger claims  distributions of insurance limits provided  loss reporting and payment patterns  and rate change history 
this analysis is used to project expected loss ratios for each treaty during the upcoming contract period 
as mentioned above  there can be a considerable time lag from the time a claim is reported to a ceding company to the time it is reported to the reinsurer 
the lag can be several years in some cases and may be attributed to a number of reasons  including the time it takes to investigate a claim  delays associated with the litigation process  the deterioration in a claimant s physical condition many years after an accident occurs  the case reserving approach of the ceding company  etc 
in the reserving process  our reinsurance operations assume that such lags are predictable  on average  over time and therefore the lags are contemplated in the loss reporting patterns used in their actuarial methods 
this means that our reinsurance operations must rely on estimates for a longer period of time than does an insurance company 
backlogs in the recording of assumed reinsurance can also complicate the accuracy of loss reserve estimation 
as of december   there were no significant backlogs related to the processing of assumed reinsurance information at our reinsurance operations 
our reinsurance operations rely heavily on information reported by ceding companies  as discussed above 
in order to determine the accuracy and completeness of such information  underwriters  actuaries  and claims personnel at our reinsurance operations often perform audits of ceding companies 
table of contents and regularly review information received from ceding companies for unusual or unexpected results 
material findings are usually discussed with the ceding companies 
our reinsurance operations sometimes encounter situations where they determine that a claim presentation from a ceding company is not in accordance with contract terms 
in these situations  our reinsurance operations attempt to resolve the dispute with the ceding company 
most situations are resolved amicably and without the need for litigation or arbitration 
however  in the infrequent situations where a resolution is not possible  our reinsurance operations will vigorously defend their position in such disputes

as the loss data has developed  other actuarial methods have been given more weight in our reserving process for certain lines of business 
in order to illustrate the potential volatility in our loss reserves  we used a monte carlo simulation approach to simulate a range of results based on various probabilities 
both the probabilities and related modeling are subject to inherent uncertainties 
the simulation relies on a significant number of assumptions  such as the potential for multiple entities to react similarly to external events  and includes other statistical assumptions 
at december   our recorded loss reserves by operating segment  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable and the results of the simulation were as follows december  insurance reinsurance total total net reserves simulation results th percentile th percentile simulation results indicate that a probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will not exceed the indicated amount 
simulation results indicate that a probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will be at or below the indicated amount 

table of contents the simulation results shown for each segment do not add to the total simulation results  as the individual segment simulation results do not reflect the diversification effects across our segments 
for informational purposes  based on the total simulation results  a change in our loss reserves to the amount indicated at the th percentile would result in a decrease in income before income taxes of approximately billion  or per diluted share  while a change in our loss reserves to the amount indicated at the th percentile would result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately billion  or per diluted share 
the simulation results noted above are informational only  and no assurance can be given that our ultimate losses will not be significantly different than the simulation results shown above  and such differences could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined 
we do not have significant exposure to pre liabilities  such as asbestos related illnesses and other long tail liabilities and  to date  we have experienced a relatively low level of reported claims activity in many lines of business  particularly in longer tailed lines such as primary and excess casualty and executive assurance  which have longer time periods during which claims are reported and paid 
our limited history does not provide meaningful trend information for such lines of business 
ceded reinsurance in the normal course of business  our insurance operations cede a portion of their premium through pro rata  excess of loss and facultative reinsurance agreements 
our reinsurance operations also obtain reinsurance whereby another reinsurer contractually agrees to indemnify it for all or a portion of the reinsurance risks underwritten by our reinsurance operations 
such arrangements  where one reinsurer provides reinsurance to another reinsurer  are usually referred to as retrocessional reinsurance arrangements 
in addition  our reinsurance subsidiaries participate in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain pro rata treaties 
such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all companies participating on such treaties  including the reinsurers  such as our reinsurance operations  and the ceding company 
reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets  predicated on the reinsurers ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
if the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements  our insurance or reinsurance operations would be liable for such defaulted amounts 
the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
although we believe that our insurance and reinsurance operations have been successful in obtaining reinsurance and retrocessional protection  it is not certain that they will be able to continue to obtain adequate protection at cost effective levels 
as a result of such market conditions and other factors  our insurance and reinsurance operations may not be able to successfully mitigate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements and may lead to increased volatility in our results of operations in future periods 
see risk factors risks relating to our industry the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our insurance operations had in effect during a reinsurance program which provided coverage equal to a maximum of of the first million in excess of a million retention per occurrence for certain property catastrophe related losses occurring during during  a reinsurance program was in effect which provided coverage equal to a maximum of of the first million in excess of a million retention per occurrence for certain property catastrophe related losses occurring during  compared to a maximum of of the first million in excess of a million retention per occurrence during in the first quarter  our insurance operations renewed its reinsurance program which provides coverage for certain property catastrophe related losses occurring during equal to a maximum of of the first million in excess of a million retention per occurrence 

table of contents for purposes of managing risk  we reinsure a portion of our exposures  paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies we write  and we may also use retrocessional protection 
ceded premiums written represented approximately of gross premiums written for  compared to for and for we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place coverages only with substantial  financially sound carriers 
if the financial condition of our reinsurers or retrocessionaires deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we will provide for probable losses resulting from our inability to collect amounts due from such parties  as appropriate 
we evaluate the credit worthiness of all the reinsurers to which we cede business 
if our analysis indicates that there is significant uncertainty regarding the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers  managing general agents  brokers and other clients  we will record a provision for doubtful accounts 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources financial condition premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables for further details 
premium revenues and related expenses insurance premiums written are generally recorded at the policy inception and are primarily earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies for all products  usually months 
premiums written include estimates in our insurance operations programs  specialty lines  collateral protection business and for participation in involuntary pools 
the amount of such insurance premium estimates included in premiums receivable and other assets at december  and was million and million  respectively 
such premium estimates are derived from multiple sources which include the historical experience of the underlying business  similar business and available industry information 
unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written that relates to the unexpired terms of in force insurance policies 
reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by brokers and ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of premiums where reports have not been received 
the determination of premium estimates requires a review of our experience with the ceding companies  familiarity with each market  the timing of the reported information  an analysis and understanding of the characteristics of each line of business  and management s judgment of the impact of various factors  including premium or loss trends  on the volume of business written and ceded to us 
on an ongoing basis  our underwriters review the amounts reported by these third parties for reasonableness based on their experience and knowledge of the subject class of business  taking into account our historical experience with the brokers or ceding companies 
in addition  reinsurance contracts under which we assume business generally contain specific provisions which allow us to perform audits of the ceding company to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract  including accurate and timely reporting of information 
based on a review of all available information  management establishes premium estimates where reports have not been received 
premium estimates are updated when new information is received and differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined 
premiums written are recorded based on the type of contracts we write 
premiums on our excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  is generally recorded as an estimate of premiums written as of the inception date of the treaty 
estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies 
for multi year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments  generally  only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy 
the remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 

table of contents reinstatement premiums for our insurance and reinsurance operations are recognized at the time a loss event occurs  where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre defined contract terms 
reinstatement premiums  if obligatory  are fully earned when recognized 
the accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on an estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses  which reflects management s judgment  as described above in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the amount of reinsurance premium estimates included in premiums receivable and the amount of related acquisition expenses by type of business were as follows at december  and december  gross amount acquisition expenses net amount gross amount acquisition expenses net amount casualty property excluding property catastrophe marine and aviation other specialty property catastrophe other total premium estimates are reviewed by management at least quarterly 
such review includes a comparison of actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates 
based on management s review  the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated  and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
adjustments to premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined because the estimated premium may be fully or substantially earned 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
based on currently available information  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectible and  therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts has been recorded on the premium estimates at december  reinsurance premiums assumed  irrespective of the class of business  are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts 
contracts and policies written on a losses occurring basis cover claims that may occur during the term of the contract or policy  which is typically months 
accordingly  the premium is earned evenly over the term 
contracts which are written on a risks attaching basis cover claims which attach to the underlying insurance policies written during the terms of such contracts 
premiums earned on such contracts usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract  typically resulting in recognition of premiums earned over a month period 
certain of our reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the experience under the contracts 
premiums written and earned  as well as related acquisition expenses  are recorded based upon the projected experience under such contracts 
retroactive reinsurance reimburses a ceding company for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events covered by the underlying policies reinsured 
in certain instances  reinsurance contracts cover losses both on a prospective basis and on a retroactive basis and  accordingly  we bifurcate the prospective and retrospective elements of these reinsurance contracts and account for each element 
table of contents separately 
underwriting income generated in connection with retroactive reinsurance contracts is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period while losses are charged to income immediately 
subsequent changes in estimated or actual cash flows under such retroactive reinsurance contracts are accounted for by adjusting the previously deferred amount to the balance that would have existed had the revised estimate been available at the inception of the reinsurance transaction  with a corresponding charge or credit to income 
acquisition expenses and other expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business in our underwriting operations are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
acquisition expenses  net of ceding commissions received from unaffiliated reinsurers  consist primarily of commissions  brokerage and taxes paid to obtain our business 
other operating expenses also include expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business 
deferred acquisition costs  which are based on the related unearned premiums  are carried at their estimated realizable value and take into account anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses  based on historical and current experience  and anticipated investment income 
fair value measurements accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under gaap and provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
it defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly fashion between market participants at the measurement date 
in addition  it establishes a three level valuation hierarchy for the disclosure of fair value measurements 
the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the level in the hierarchy within which a given fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement level being the highest priority and level being the lowest priority 
we determine the existence of an active market based on our judgment as to whether transactions for the financial instrument occur in such market with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information 
the independent pricing sources obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
we use quoted values and other data provided by nationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into our process for determining fair values of our fixed maturity investments 
to validate the techniques or models used by pricing sources  our review process includes  but is not limited to i quantitative analysis eg  comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to their target benchmark  with significant differences identified and investigated  ii a review of the average number of prices obtained in the pricing process and the range of resulting market values  iii initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value including a review of deep dive reports on selected securities which indicated the use of observable inputs in the pricing process  iv comparing the fair value estimates to our knowledge of the current market  v a comparison of the pricing services fair values to other pricing services fair values for the same investments  and vi back testing  which includes randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing the executed prices to the fair value estimates from the pricing service 
at december  and  we obtained an average of quotes per investment 
where multiple quotes or prices were obtained  a price source hierarchy was maintained in order to determine which price source provided the fair value ie  a price obtained from a pricing service with more seniority in the hierarchy will be used from a less senior one in all cases 
the hierarchy prioritizes pricing services based on availability and reliability and assigns the highest priority to index providers 
based on the above review  we will challenge any prices for a security or portfolio which are considered not to be representative of fair value 
the independent pricing sources obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
each source has its own proprietary method for 
table of contents determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded 
in general  these methods involve the use of matrix pricing in which the independent pricing source uses observable market inputs including  but not limited to  investment yields  credit risks and spreads  benchmarking of like securities  broker dealer quotes  reported trades and sector groupings to determine a reasonable fair market value 
in addition  pricing vendors use model processes  such as an option adjusted spread model  to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the option adjusted spread model is commonly used to estimate fair value for securities such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
in certain circumstances  when fair market values are unavailable from these independent pricing sources  quotes are obtained directly from broker dealers who are active in the corresponding markets 
such quotes are subject to the validation procedures noted above 
of the billion of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value  approximately billion  or  were priced using non binding broker dealer quotes 
in april  the fasb issued guidance regarding the determination of fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and the identification of transactions that are not orderly 
this affirms that the objective of fair value when the market for an asset is not active is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction  and clarifies and includes additional factors for determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset when the market for that asset is not active 
under this guidance  if an entity determines that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or the liability in relation to the normal market activity for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities  then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value 
in addition  if there is evidence that the transaction for the asset or liability is not orderly  the entity shall place little  if any weight on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value 
this guidance also expanded certain disclosure requirements 
this guidance was effective for periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we elected to adopt this pronouncement effective for the interim period ending march   and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we review our securities measured at fair value and discuss the proper classification of such investments with investment advisors and others 
see note  fair value  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at december  by valuation hierarchy 
other than temporary impairments otti in april  the fasb issued guidance regarding the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which requires entities to separate an otti of a debt security into two components when there are credit related losses associated with the impaired debt security for which an entity asserts that it does not have the intent to sell the security  and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis 
prior to january   we had to determine whether we had the intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover 
our process for identifying declines in the market value of investments that were considered other than temporary involved consideration of several factors 
these factors included i an analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  ii the time period in which there was a significant decline in value  and iii the significance of the decline 
when the analysis of such factors resulted in our conclusion that declines in market values were other than temporary  the cost of the securities was written down to market value and the reduction in value was reflected as a realized loss 
effective under this guidance  the amount of the otti related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings  and the amount of the otti related to other factors eg  interest rates  market conditions  etc 
is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
in instances where no credit loss exists but it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery  the decline in market value below amortized 
table of contents cost is recognized as an otti in earnings 
in periods after the recognition of an otti on debt securities  we account for such securities as if they had been purchased on the measurement date of the otti at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings 
for debt securities for which otti were recognized in earnings  the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected will be accreted or amortized into net investment income 
this guidance was effective for periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we elected to adopt this guidance effective for the interim period ended march  this guidance required that we record  as of the beginning of the interim period of adoption  a cumulative effect adjustment to reclassify the noncredit component of a previously recognized otti from retained earnings to other comprehensive income loss 
for purposes of calculating the cumulative effect adjustment  we reviewed otti that we had recorded through realized losses on securities held at december   which were million  and estimated the portion related to credit losses ie  where the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are lower than the amortized cost basis of the security and the portion related to all other factors 
we determined that million of the otti previously recorded related to specific credit losses and million related to all other factors 
we increased the amortized cost basis of these debt securities by million and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment  net of tax  in our shareholders equity section 
the cumulative effect adjustment had no effect on total shareholders equity as it increased retained earnings and reduced accumulated other comprehensive income 
we performed quarterly reviews of our investments in  and in order to determine whether declines in market value below the amortized cost basis were considered other than temporary in accordance with applicable guidance 
during  we recorded million of net impairment losses recognized in earnings  compared to million in and million in see note  investment information other than temporary impairments  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
reclassifications we have reclassified the presentation of certain prior year information to conform to the current presentation

the ratings were obtained from the individual rating agencies and were assigned a numerical amount with being the highest rating 
the average ratings were calculated using the weighted average market values of the individual bonds 
the average ratings with and without the insurance enhancement are substantially the same at december  this is due to the fact that  in cases where the claims paying ratings of the guarantors are below investment grade  those ratings have been withdrawn from the bonds by the relevant rating agencies  and the insured ratings have been equated to the underlying ratings

at december   our investments in mortgage backed securities mbs  excluding commercial mortgage backed securities  amounted to approximately billion  or of total investable assets  compared to billion  or  at december  as with other fixed income investments  the market value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment 
changes in interest rates can expose us to changes in the prepayment rate on these investments 
in periods of declining interest rates  mortgage prepayments generally increase and mbs are prepaid more quickly  requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates 
conversely  in periods of rising rates  mortgage prepayments generally fall  preventing us from taking full advantage of the higher level of rates 
however  current economic conditions may curtail prepayment activity as refinancing becomes more difficult  thus limiting prepayments on mbs 

table of contents since  the residential mortgage market in the us has experienced a variety of difficulties 
during this time  delinquencies and losses with respect to residential mortgage loans generally have increased and may continue to increase  particularly in the subprime sector 
in addition  during this period  residential property values in many states have declined or remained stable  after extended periods during which those values appreciated 
a continued decline or an extended flattening in those values may result in additional increases in delinquencies and losses on residential mortgage loans generally  especially with respect to second homes and investment properties  and with respect to any residential mortgage loans where the aggregate loan amounts including any subordinate loans are close to or greater than the related property values 
these developments may have a significant adverse effect on the prices of loans and securities  including those in our investment portfolio

table of contents certain of our investments  primarily those included in other investments and investment funds accounted for using the equity method on our balance sheet  may use leverage to achieve a higher rate of return 
while leverage presents opportunities for increasing the total return of such investments  it may increase losses as well 
accordingly  any event that adversely affects the value of the underlying securities held by such investments would be magnified to the extent leverage is used and our potential losses from such investments would be magnified 
in addition  the structures used to generate leverage may lead to such investment funds being required to meet covenants based on market valuations and asset coverage 
market valuation declines in the funds could force the sale of investments into a depressed market  which may result in significant additional losses 
alternatively  the funds may attempt to deleverage by raising additional equity or potentially changing the terms of the established financing arrangements 
we may choose to participate in the additional funding of such investments 
our investment commitments related to investment funds accounted for using the equity method totaled approximately million at december  our investment strategy allows for the use of derivative instruments

table of contents reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses loss reserves which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections  at a given point in time  of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred 
estimating loss reserves is inherently difficult  which is exacerbated by the fact that we are a relatively new company with relatively limited historical experience upon which to base such estimates 
we utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of loss reserves 
actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid will deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements

table of contents liquidity and capital resources acgl is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in its subsidiaries 
generally  acgl depends on its available cash resources  liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries to make payments  including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses it may incur and any dividends or liquidation amounts with respect to the series a non cumulative and series b non cumulative preferred shares and common shares 
acgl s readily available cash  short term investments and marketable securities  excluding amounts held by our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  during  acgl received dividends of million from arch re bermuda which were used to fund the share repurchase program described below along with the payment of preferred dividends  interest expense and other corporate expenses 
the ability of our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards 
under bermuda law  arch re bermuda is required to maintain an enhanced capital requirement which must equal or exceed its minimum solvency margin ie  the amount by which the value of its general business assets must exceed its general business liabilities equal to the greatest of million  of net premiums written being gross premiums written by us less any premiums ceded by us  but we may not deduct more than of gross premiums when computing net premiums written and of loss and other insurance reserves 
arch re bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is not in compliance with its enhanced capital requirement  minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio 
in addition  arch re bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files  at least seven days before payment of such dividends  with the bermuda monetary authority an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins 
in addition  arch re bermuda is prohibited  without prior approval of the bermuda monetary authority  from reducing by or more its total statutory capital  as set out in its previous year s statutory financial statements 
arch re bermuda is required to meet enhanced capital requirements and a target capital level defined as of the enhanced capital requirements as calculated using a new risk based capital model called the bermuda solvency capital requirement bscr model 
at december   as determined under bermuda law  arch re bermuda had statutory capital of billion billion at december  and statutory capital and surplus of billion billion at december   which amounts were in compliance with arch re bermuda s enhanced capital requirement at such date 
such amounts include ownership interests in us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
accordingly  arch re bermuda can pay approximately billion to acgl during without providing an affidavit to the bermuda monetary authority  as discussed above 
in addition to meeting applicable regulatory standards  the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to intermediate parent companies owned by arch re bermuda is also constrained by our dependence on the financial strength ratings of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries from independent rating agencies 
the ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
we believe that acgl has sufficient cash resources and available dividend capacity to service its indebtedness and other current outstanding obligations 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are required to maintain assets on deposit  which primarily consist of fixed maturities  with various regulatory authorities to support their operations 
the assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities to third parties 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for letters of credit to third parties 
at december  and  such amounts approximated billion and billion  respectively 
in addition  certain of our operating subsidiaries maintain assets in trust accounts as collateral for insurance and reinsurance 
table of contents transactions with affiliated companies 
at december  and  such amounts approximated billion and billion  respectively 
acgl  through its subsidiaries  provides financial support to certain of its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates  through certain reinsurance arrangements essential to the ratings of such subsidiaries 
except as described in the preceding sentence  or where express reinsurance  guarantee or other financial support contractual arrangements are in place  each of acgl s subsidiaries or affiliates is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments and no other acgl subsidiary or affiliate is so responsible 
any reinsurance arrangements  guarantees or other financial support contractual arrangements that are in place are solely for the benefit of the acgl subsidiary or affiliate involved and third parties creditors or insureds of such entity are not express beneficiaries of such arrangements 
our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance  sometimes substantially in advance  of the time losses are paid 
the period of time from the occurrence of a claim through the settlement of the liability may extend many years into the future 
sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations  financing arrangements or routine sales of investments 
as part of our investment strategy  we seek to establish a level of cash and highly liquid short term and intermediate term securities which  combined with expected cash flow  is believed by us to be adequate to meet our foreseeable payment obligations 
however  due to the nature of our operations  cash flows are affected by claim payments that may comprise large payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate from year to year 
we believe that our liquid investments and cash flow will provide us with sufficient liquidity in order to meet our claim payment obligations 
however  the timing and amounts of actual claim payments related to recorded loss reserves vary based on many factors  including large individual losses  changes in the legal environment  as well as general market conditions 
the ultimate amount of the claim payments could differ materially from our estimated amounts 
certain lines of business written by us  such as excess casualty  have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity 
the foregoing may result in significant variability in loss payment patterns 
the impact of this variability can be exacerbated by the fact that the timing of the receipt of reinsurance recoverables owed to us may be slower than anticipated by us 
therefore  the irregular timing of claim payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods and may require us to utilize other sources of liquidity to make these payments  which may include the sale of investments or utilization of existing or new credit facilities or capital market transactions 
if the source of liquidity is the sale of investments  we may be forced to sell such investments at a loss  which may be material 
our investments in certain securities  including certain fixed income and structured securities  investments in funds accounted for using the equity method  other investments and our investment in gulf re joint venture may be illiquid due to contractual provisions or investment market conditions 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements  then we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or may be forced to sell or terminate them at unfavorable values 
consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared to billion for the lower level of operating cash flows in primarily resulted from an increase in paid losses  as our insurance and reinsurance loss reserves have continued to mature  partially offset by an increase in net premium collections 
cash flow from operating activities are provided by premiums collected  fee income  investment income and collected reinsurance recoverables  offset by losses and loss adjustment expense payments  reinsurance premiums paid  operating costs and current taxes paid 

table of contents on a consolidated basis  our aggregate cash and invested assets totaled billion at december   compared to billion at december  the primary goals of our asset liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities  manage the interest rate risk embedded in those insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows  including debt service obligations 
generally  the expected principal and interest payments produced by our fixed income portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of our insurance reserves 
although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period  the substantial degree by which the market value of the fixed income portfolio exceeds the expected present value of the net insurance liabilities  as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds  provide assurance of our ability to fund the payment of claims and to service our outstanding debt without having to sell securities at distressed prices in an illiquid market or access credit facilities 
we expect that our operational needs  including our anticipated insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs  for the next twelve months  at a minimum  will be met by our balance of cash  short term investments and our credit facilities  as well as by funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income and proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments 
we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis and will seek to adjust our capital base up or down according to the needs of our business 
the future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
in particular  we require sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings  as issued by several ratings agencies  at a level considered necessary by management to enable our key operating subsidiaries to compete  sufficient capital to enable our underwriting subsidiaries to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by statutory agencies in the us and other key markets  and letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are necessary for our non us operating companies because they are non admitted under us state insurance regulations 
as part of our capital management program  we may seek to raise additional capital or may seek to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases  cash dividends or other methods or a combination of such methods 
any such determination will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our profits  financial requirements and other factors  including legal restrictions  rating agency requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
in november  the board of directors of acgl authorized the investment of up to an additional billion in acgl s common shares through a share repurchase program 
repurchases under this authorization may be effected from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions through december  the board of directors of acgl had previously authorized the investment of up to billion in acgl s common shares 
during  acgl repurchased million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of million and from january to february   acgl repurchased million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
since the inception of the share repurchase program in february through february   acgl has repurchased million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of billion 
at february   million of repurchases were available under the share repurchase program 
the timing and amount of the repurchase transactions under this program will depend on a variety of factors  including market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
we will continue to monitor our share price and  depending upon results of operations  market conditions and the development of the economy  as well as other factors  we will consider share repurchases on an opportunistic basis 

table of contents to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements or maintain such ratings  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
given the recent severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including among other things  widening of credit spreads  lack of liquidity and bankruptcies  we can provide no assurance that  if needed  we would be able to obtain additional funds through financing on satisfactory terms or at all 
continued adverse developments in the financial markets  such as disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets  may result in realized and unrealized capital losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and our businesses  and may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business 
if we are not able to obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  which could include  among other things  the following possible outcomes potential downgrades in the financial strength ratings assigned by ratings agencies to our operating subsidiaries  which could place those operating subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage compared to higher rated competitors  reductions in the amount of business that our operating subsidiaries are able to write in order to meet capital adequacy based tests enforced by statutory agencies  and any resultant ratings downgrades could  among other things  affect our ability to write business and increase the cost of bank credit and letters of credit 
in addition  under certain of the reinsurance agreements assumed by our reinsurance operations  upon the occurrence of a ratings downgrade or other specified triggering event with respect to our reinsurance operations  such as a reduction in surplus by specified amounts during specified periods  our ceding company clients may be provided with certain rights  including  among other things  the right to terminate the subject reinsurance agreement and or to require that our reinsurance operations post additional collateral 
in addition to common share capital  we depend on external sources of finance to support our underwriting activities  which can be in the form or any combination of debt securities  preference shares  common equity and bank credit facilities providing loans and or letters of credit 
as noted above  equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and  in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities 
in  we entered into a five year agreement for a million unsecured revolving loan and letter of credit facility and a billion secured letter of credit facility 
under the terms of the agreement  arch reinsurance company arch re us is limited to issuing million of unsecured letters of credit as part of the million unsecured revolving loan 
arch re bermuda also has access to other letter of credit facilities  some of which are available on a limited basis for limited purposes 
see contractual obligations and commercial commitments letters of credit and revolving credit facilities for a discussion of our available facilities  applicable covenants on such facilities and available capacity 
it is anticipated that the available facilities will be renewed or replaced on expiry  but such renewal or replacement will be subject to the availability of credit from banks which we utilize 
given the recent disruptions in the capital markets  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to renew the facilities in august on satisfactory terms and  if renewed  the costs of the facilities may be significantly higher than the costs of our existing facilities 
during  acgl completed two public offerings of non cumulative preferred shares 
on february   million principal amount of series a non cumulative preferred shares series a preferred shares were issued with net proceeds of million and  on may   million principal amount of series b non cumulative preferred shares series b preferred shares and together with the series a preferred shares  the preferred shares were issued with net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of the offerings were used to support the underwriting activities of acgl s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
acgl has the right to redeem all or a portion of each series of preferred shares at a redemption price of per share on or after february  for the series a preferred shares and may  for the series b 
table of contents preferred shares 
dividends on the preferred shares are non cumulative 
consequently  in the event dividends are not declared on the preferred shares for any dividend period  holders of preferred shares will not be entitled to receive a dividend for such period  and such undeclared dividend will not accrue and will not be payable 
holders of preferred shares will be entitled to receive dividend payments only when  as and if declared by acgl s board of directors or a duly authorized committee of acgl s board of directors 
any such dividends will be payable from the date of original issue on a non cumulative basis  quarterly in arrears 
to the extent declared  these dividends will accumulate  with respect to each dividend period  in an amount per share equal to of the liquidation preference per annum for the series a preferred shares and of the liquidation preference per annum for the series b preferred shares 
during  and  we paid million to holders of the preferred shares and  at december   had declared an aggregate of million of dividends to be paid to holders of the preferred shares 
in march  acgl and arch capital group us inc filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
this registration statement allows for the possible future offer and sale by us of various types of securities  including unsecured debt securities  preference shares  common shares  warrants  share purchase contracts and units and depositary shares 
the shelf registration statement enables us to efficiently access the public debt and or equity capital markets in order to meet our future capital needs 
the shelf registration statement also allows selling shareholders to resell common shares that they own in one or more offerings from time to time 
we will not receive any proceeds from any shares offered by the selling shareholders 
this report is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state 
during the third quarter  we purchased asset backed and commercial mortgage backed securities under the frbny s talf program 
as of december   we had million of securities under the talf program which are reflected as talf investments  at market value and million of secured financing from the frbny which is reflected as talf borrowings  at market value 
see contractual obligations and commercial commitments talf program for further details on the talf program

at december   acgl s capital of billion consisted of million of senior notes  representing of the total  million of revolving credit agreement borrowings due in august  representing of the total  million of preferred shares  representing of the total  and common shareholders equity of billion  representing the balance 
talf borrowings are not included in the calculation of total capital 
the increase in capital during was primarily attributable to net income and an after tax increase in the market value of our investment portfolio 
natural and man made catastrophic events we have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made catastrophic events 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  tornados  explosions  severe winter weather  fires  droughts and other natural disasters 
catastrophes can also cause losses in non property business such as workers compensation or general liability 
in addition to the nature of property business  we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property  including inflation  property value appreciation and geographic concentration  tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time 

table of contents we have substantial exposure to unexpected  large losses resulting from future man made catastrophic events  such as acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable 
it is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate 
it is not possible to completely eliminate our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events and  to the extent that losses from such risks occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
therefore  claims for natural and man made catastrophic events could expose us to large losses and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations  which could cause the value of our common shares to fluctuate widely 
in certain instances  we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from terrorism 
even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us  we may not be successful in doing so 
moreover  irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language  there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or otherwise issue a ruling adverse to us 
we seek to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written in defined geographical zones  limiting program size for each client and prudent underwriting of each program written 
in the case of proportional treaties  we may seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one or series of events 
in our insurance operations  we seek to limit our exposure through the purchase of reinsurance 
we cannot be certain that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
there can be no assurance that various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  will be enforceable in the manner we intend 
disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise 
underwriting is inherently a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity 
for our natural catastrophe exposed business  we seek to limit the amount of exposure we will assume from any one insured or reinsured and the amount of the exposure to catastrophe losses from a single event in any geographic zone 
we monitor our exposure to catastrophic events  including earthquake and wind and periodically reevaluate the estimated probable maximum pre tax loss for such exposures 
our estimated probable maximum pre tax loss is determined through the use of modeling techniques  but such estimate does not represent our total potential loss for such exposures 
our models employ both proprietary and vendor based systems and include cross line correlations for property  marine  offshore energy  aviation  workers compensation and personal accident 
we seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to a specific level for severe catastrophic events 
currently  we seek to limit our in year return period net probable maximum loss from a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone to approximately of total shareholders equity 
we reserve the right to change this threshold at any time 
net probable maximum loss estimates are net of expected reinsurance recoveries  before income tax and before excess reinsurance reinstatement premiums 
loss estimates are reflective of the zone indicated and not the entire portfolio 
since hurricanes and windstorms can affect more than one zone and make multiple landfalls  our loss estimates include clash estimates from other zones 
our loss estimates do not represent our maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates 
there can be no assurances that we will not suffer pre tax losses greater than of our total shareholders equity from one or more catastrophic events due to several factors  including the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such 
table of contents determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques or as a result of a decision to change the percentage of shareholders equity exposed to a single catastrophic event 
in addition  actual losses may increase if our reinsurers fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance protections purchased by us are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable 
see risk factors risk relating to our industry and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations natural and man made catastrophic events 
depending on business opportunities and the mix of business that may comprise our insurance and reinsurance portfolio  we may seek to adjust our self imposed limitations on probable maximum pre tax loss for catastrophe exposed business

contractual obligations and commercial commitments letter of credit and revolving credit facilities as of december   we had a million unsecured revolving loan and letter of credit facility and a billion secured letter of credit facility the credit agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  arch re us is limited to issuing million of unsecured letters of credit as part of the million unsecured revolving loan 
borrowings of revolving loans may be made by acgl and arch re us at a variable rate based on libor or an alternative base rate at our option 
secured letters of credit are available for issuance on behalf of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
the credit agreement and related documents are structured such that each party that requests a letter of credit or borrowing does so only for itself and for only its own obligations 
issuance of letters of credit and borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to our compliance with certain covenants and conditions  including absence of a material adverse change 
these covenants require  among other things  that we maintain a debt to total capital ratio of not greater than to and shareholders equity in excess of billion plus of future aggregate net income for each quarterly period not including any future net losses beginning after june  and of future aggregate proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred equity and that our principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain at least a b rating from am best 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries which are party to the credit agreement are required to maintain minimum shareholders equity levels 
we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement at december  the credit agreement expires on august  including the secured letter of credit portion of the credit agreement  we had access to letter of credit facilities for up to a total of billion 
arch re bermuda also has access to other letter of credit facilities  some of which are available on a limited basis and for limited purposes together with the secured portion of the credit agreement and these letter of credit facilities  the loc facilities 
the principal purpose of the loc facilities is to issue  as required  evergreen standby letters of credit in favor of primary insurance or reinsurance counterparties with which we have entered into reinsurance arrangements to ensure that such counterparties are permitted to take credit for reinsurance obtained from our reinsurance subsidiaries in united states jurisdictions where such subsidiaries are not licensed or otherwise admitted as an insurer  as required under insurance regulations in the united states  and to comply with requirements of lloyd s in connection with qualifying quota share and other arrangements 
the amount of letters of credit issued is driven by  among other things  the timing and payment of catastrophe losses  loss development of existing reserves  the payment pattern of such reserves  the further expansion of our business and the loss experience of such business 
when issued  certain letters of credit are secured by a portion of our investment portfolio 
in addition  the loc facilities also require the maintenance of certain covenants  which we were in compliance with at december  at such date  we had million in outstanding letters of credit under the loc facilities  which were secured by investments with a market

off balance sheet arrangements we are not party to any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
we concluded that we are required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations if any of a certain managing general agency in which one of our subsidiaries has an investment 
such agency ceased producing business in and is currently running off its operations 
based on current information  there are no assets or liabilities of such agency required to be reflected on the face of our consolidated financial statements that are not  
table of contents or have not been previously  otherwise reflected therein 
in addition  we determined that flatiron is a variable interest entity but we are not required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of flatiron 
under the amended guidance governing accounting for vies  which is effective january   we do not expect that flatiron will be considered a variable interest entity

market sensitive instruments and risk management our investment results are subject to a variety of risks  including risks related to changes in the business  financial condition or results of operations of the entities in which we invest  as well as changes in general economic conditions and overall market conditions 
we are also exposed to potential loss from various market risks  including changes in equity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in accordance with the sec s financial reporting release no 
 we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  market values or cash flows of our financial instruments as of december  market risk represents the risk of changes in the market value of a financial instrument and consists of several components  including liquidity  basis and price risks 
the sensitivity analysis performed as of december  presents hypothetical losses in cash flows  earnings and market values of market sensitive instruments which were held by us on december  and are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity security prices 
this risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the following sensitivity analysis represent forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses 
the focus of the sec s market risk rules is on price risk 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we employ sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  market values or cash flows of our financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the following sensitivity analysis consist of all of our investments and cash 
investment market risk fixed income securities 
we invest in interest rate sensitive securities  primarily debt securities 
we consider the effect of interest rate movements on the market value of our fixed maturities  fixed maturities pledged under securities lending agreements  short term investments and certain of our other investments which invest in fixed income securities and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities falls  and the converse is also true 
the following table summarizes the effect that an immediate  parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on the portfolio at december  and based on historical observations  there is a low probability that all interest rate yield curves would shift in the same direction at the same time 
furthermore  interest rate movements in many credit sectors during and have exhibited a much lower correlation to changes in us treasury yields 
accordingly  the actual effect of interest rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth below

interest rate shift in basis points us dollars in millions december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value in addition  we consider the effect of credit spread movements on the market value of our fixed maturities  fixed maturities pledged under securities lending agreements  short term investments and certain of our other investments and investment funds accounted for using the equity method which invest in fixed income securities and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation 
as credit spreads widen  the market value of our fixed income securities falls  and the converse is also true 
the following table summarizes the effect that an immediate  parallel shift in credit spreads in a static interest rate environment would have had on the portfolio at december  credit spread shift in basis points us dollars in millions december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value another method that attempts to measure portfolio risk is value at risk var 
var attempts to take into account a broad cross section of risks facing a portfolio by utilizing relevant securities volatility data skewed towards the most recent months and quarters 
var measures the amount of a portfolio at risk for outcomes standard deviations from the mean based on normal market conditions over a one year time horizon and is expressed as a percentage of the portfolio s initial value 
in other words  of the time  should the risks taken into account in the var model perform per their historical tendencies  the portfolio s loss in any one year period is expected to be less than or equal to the calculated var  stated as a percentage of the measured portfolio s initial value 
as of december   our portfolio s var was estimated to be  compared to an estimated at december  privately held securities and equity securities 
our investment portfolio includes an allocation to privately held securities and equity securities 
at december  and  the market value of our investments in privately held securities and equity securities excluding our investment in aeolus lp which is accounted for using the equity method totaled million and million  respectively 
these securities are exposed to price risk  which is the potential loss arising from decreases in market value 
an immediate hypothetical depreciation in the value of each position would reduce the 
table of contents market value of such investments by approximately million and million at december and  respectively  and would have decreased book value per common share by approximately and  respectively 
investment related derivatives 
derivative instruments may be used to enhance investment performance  replicate investment positions or manage market exposures and duration risk that would be allowed under our investment guidelines if implemented in other ways 
the market values of those derivatives are based on quoted market prices 
see note  derivative instruments  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures concerning derivatives 
at december   the notional value of the net long position of derivative instruments excluding to be announced mortgage backed securities which are included in the fixed income securities analysis above and foreign currency forward contracts which are included in the foreign currency exchange risk analysis below was billion  compared to million at december  a basis point depreciation of the underlying exposure to these derivative instruments at december  and would have resulted in a reduction in net income of approximately million and million  respectively  and would have decreased book value per common share by and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency rate risk is the potential change in value  income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
through our subsidiaries and branches located in various foreign countries  we conduct our insurance and reinsurance operations in a variety of local currencies other than the us dollar 
we generally hold investments in foreign currencies which are intended to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our net insurance liabilities 
we may also utilize foreign currency forward contracts and currency options as part of our investment strategy 
in addition  as a result of the current financial and economic environment as well as the potential for additional investment returns  we may not match a portion of our projected liabilities in foreign currencies with investments in the same currencies  which would increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and increase the volatility in our results of operations 
a appreciation of the us dollar against the major foreign currencies for our outstanding contracts at december  and  net of unrealized depreciation on our securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  would have resulted in unrealized losses of approximately million and million  respectively  and would have decreased book value per common share by approximately and  respectively 
historical observations indicate a low probability that all foreign currency exchange rates would shift against the us dollar in the same direction and at the same time and  accordingly  the actual effect of foreign currency rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth above 
for further discussion on foreign exchange activity  please refer to results of operations 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and interest rates 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects of inflation on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled
