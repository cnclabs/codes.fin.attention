item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents raw materials we procure raw materials and components from many different vendors located throughout the world 
a portion of these components are electrical in nature  including permanent magnet motors  induction motors and drives 
we also purchase hydraulic components  such as motors  from certain suppliers located in the united states 
in order to manufacture many of our proprietary parts  we require substantial quantities of steel 
we select our component sources from  and establish supply relationships with  vendors who are prepared to develop components and systems that allow us to produce high performance  reliable and compact machines 
for both our electric and hydraulic top drive systems we source key components  such as ac motors  power electronics  and hydraulic systems  from vendors who have developed these components for commercial  often non oilfield applications  and who have adapted them for service conditions specific to our applications 
consequently  our ability to maintain timely deliveries and to provide long term support of certain models may depend on the supply of these components and systems 
we attempt to minimize risks associated with this dependency through the development of supply agreements to maintain acceptable levels of ready components 
backlog we believe that top drive backlog is a leading indicator of how our business will be affected by changes in the global macro economic environment 
we consider a product sale order as backlog when the customer has signed a purchase contract  submitted the purchase order and  if required by the purchase agreement  paid a non refundable deposit 
as a result of the weakened economic and industry conditions in  we experienced a lower order rate and ended the year with a backlog of units  with a total value of million  compared to a backlog of top drive units at december   with a total value of million 
while we have seen a recent increase in sales activity  our customers have maintained their focus on lowering project costs and  accordingly  we have adjusted our sales prices on selected product offerings 
we believe that for our top drive business  a backlog of two quarters of production is reasonable and allows us to effectively manage our supply chain and workforce  yet be responsive to our client base 
in response to declining demand for our top drives due to industry and operating conditions  we downsized our manufacturing operations substantially during we have maintained a core team  which can continue to deliver a reasonable number of top drives each month to meet current and expected demand 
our current manufacturing capacity allows us to build up to four to six top drive units per month  depending on system complexity  down from s peak production levels of to units per month 
our manufacturing operations are flexible  and we will continue to manage our production levels to meet demand 
we believe that our top drive business needs to maintain manufacturing inventory of one to two quarters of production to limit our exposure in the event that the sales market softens and allows us to effectively manage our supply chain and workforce 
revenue from services is recognized as the services are rendered  based upon agreed daily  hourly or job rates 
accordingly  we have no backlog for services 
competitive conditions we were the first top drive manufacturer to provide portable top drives for land drilling rigs  thereby accelerating the growth of the onshore top drive market 
we estimate that approximately of land drilling rigs are currently equipped with top drive systems  including the former soviet union and china where few rigs operate with top drives today 
by contrast  we estimate that approximately of offshore rigs are equipped with top drives 
we believe that significant further market potential exists for our top drive drilling system technology  including both portable and permanently installed applications 
further  where many top drive systems approach the end of their useful lives and are inefficient or may not have legacy parts available  we believe that a market for replacement systems will be created 
this represents an important opportunity for us 
our primary competitors in the sale of top drive systems are national oilwell varco  inc nov and canrig drilling technology ltd  a subsidiary of nabors industries ltd 
we have the second largest customer installed base and are the number two global provider of top drives  following nov 
of the three major top drive system providers  we are the only company that maintains a sizeable fleet of assets solely for the purposes of rental 
competition in the sale of top drive systems takes place primarily on the basis of the features and capacities of the equipment  the quality of the services and technical support offered  delivery lead time and  to a varying extent  price 
the conventional tubular services market consists principally of several large  global operators and a large number of small and medium sized operators that typically operate in limited geographic areas where the market is highly fragmented 
the largest global competitors in this market are weatherford international  inc weatherford international  franks international  inc and bj services company 
competition in the conventional tubular services market takes place primarily on the basis of the quality of the services offered  the quality and utility of the equipment provided  the proximity of the service provider and equipment to the work site and  to a certain extent  on price 

table of contents we are aware of competitive technology similar to our cds tool 
we believe that we continue to be the market leader in this technology 
other companies offering similar technology include nov  weatherford international and franks international  inc our cds system is easily and quickly installed on any top drive system and we have the advantage of being able to offer skilled and trained personnel at the field level who have specialized knowledge of top drive drilling system operations 
we are not currently aware of any commercially or technically viable direct competition for our proprietary casing drilling retrievable process  services or products  although several of our competitors are known to have developed prototypes that are similar  and in some cases have deployed them in a field environment 
we continue to be the only company offering customers a broad range of tool sizes and the possibility of using casing to drill directional wells combined with specialized equipment that can be readily retrieved when the drilling is complete 
we believe that the that primary competition to our casing drilling process is the traditional drill pipe drilling process and  to a lesser extent  other methods for casing while drilling that do not involve a retrievable bottom hole assembly 
such alternative methods of casing while drilling offer limited applications because of the cutting structure  and they cannot be combined with directional tools which facilitate the drilling of directional ie non vertical wells 
while we offer such alternative ie non retrievable methods in addition to our proprietary casing drilling process  we believe that weatherford international has the largest share of the non retrievable portion of the market  although baker hughes is supplying an increasing number of ezcasetm bits a trademark held by baker hughes which our casing drilling team is using on behalf of the operators 
intellectual property we pursue patent protection in appropriate jurisdictions for the innovations that have significant potential application to our core businesses 
we hold patents and patent applications in the united states  canada  europe  norway  and various other countries 
we also hold rights  through patent license agreements  to other patented and or patent pending technologies 
our patent portfolio currently includes issued patents and pending patent applications 
we generally retain all intellectual property rights to our technology through non disclosure and technology ownership agreements with our employees  suppliers  consultants and other third parties with whom we do business 
the overall design of our portable top drive assembly is protected by patents that will continue in force for several more years 
various specific aspects of the design of the top drive and related equipment are also patented  including the torque track system that improves operational handling by absorbing the torque generated by our top drive 
our casing drilling method and retrievable apparatus are protected by patents that will continue in force for several more years 
in addition  we have patents that protect the combination of the retrievable drill bit assembly with a rotary steerable tool 
our cds is protected by patents on some of the gripping tools and on the link tilt system  which is a method used to handle casing 
we hold numerous patents related to the installation and utilization of certain accessories for casing for purposes of casing rotation 
various other related methods and tools are patent protected as well 
please see part i  item a risk factors we have been party to patent infringement claims and we may not be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
in addition  for a discussion of legal proceedings involving our intellectual property  please see part i  item legal proceedings 
environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental  legal  and regulatory requirements related to our operations worldwide 
in the united states  these laws and regulations include  among others the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  the resources conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the federal water pollution control act  and the toxic substances control act 

table of contents in addition to the federal laws and regulations  states and other countries where we do business may have numerous environmental  legal  and regulatory requirements by which we must abide 
we evaluate and address the environmental impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated properties in order to comply with environmental  legal  and regulatory requirements and to avoid future liabilities 
on occasion  we are involved in specific environmental claims  including the remediation of properties we own or have operated  as well as efforts to meet or correct compliance related matters 
our quality  health  safety and environment group has programs in place to maintain environmental compliance and to prevent the occurrence of environmental contamination 
we do not expect costs related to these remediation activities to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
during  we completed the sale of a building and land located in canada 
we incurred approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  in soil remediation costs to prepare the property for sale 
these costs were capitalized and added to the property s net book value 
other than these expenditures  we did not incur any material costs in  or as a result of environmental protection requirements  nor do we anticipate environmental protection requirements to have any material financial or operational effects on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position in future years 
employees as of december   the total number of employees of tesco and its subsidiaries worldwide was  we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
we work to maintain a high level of employee satisfaction and we believe our employee compensation systems are competitive 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks  including the following risks associated with the global economy the current global economic environment may continue to impact industry fundamentals  and the related decrease in demand for drilling rigs could cause current downturn in the oil and gas industry to continue 
such a condition could have a material adverse impact on our business 
an extended deterioration in the global economic environment may impact fundamentals that are critical to our industry  such as the global demand for  and consumption of  oil and natural gas 
reduced demand for oil and natural gas generally results in lower oil and natural gas prices and prolonged weakness in the economy could impact the economics of planned drilling projects  resulting in curtailment  reduction  delay or postponement for an indeterminate period of time 
any long term reduction in oil and natural gas prices will reduce oil and natural gas drilling and production activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely affect the demand for sales  rentals or services of our top drive units and for our tubular services and casing drilling businesses 
these reductions could adversely affect the future net realizability of assets  including inventory  fixed assets goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are exposed to risks associated with turmoil in the financial markets 
us and global credit and equity markets have recently undergone significant disruption  making it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  equity markets are continuing to experience wide fluctuations in value 
as a result  an increasing number of financial institutions and insurance companies have reported significant deterioration in their financial condition 
while we intend to finance our operations with existing cash  cash flow from operations and borrowing under our existing credit facility  we may require additional financing to support our growth 
if any of the significant lenders  insurance companies or other financial institutions are unable to perform their obligations under our credit agreements  insurance policies or other contracts  and we are unable to find suitable replacements on acceptable terms  our results of operations  liquidity and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we also face challenges relating to the impact of the disruption in the global financial markets on other parties with whom we do business  such as our customers and vendors 
many of our customers access the credit markets to finance their oil and natural gas drilling and production activity 
companies that planned to finance exploration or development projects through the capital markets may be forced to curtail  reduce  postpone or delay drilling activity  and also may experience an inability to pay suppliers  including us 
such reductions or delays could negatively impact our revenues  cash flows and earnings 
the inability of these parties to obtain financing on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under their agreements with us and lead to various negative effects on the company  including business disruption  decreased revenues and increases in bad debt write offs 
a sustained decline in the financial stability of these parties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks could materially impact our business 
the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries 
a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption  which could cause a decrease in spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and development 
in addition  these risks could trigger increased volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas which could also adversely affect spending by oil and gas companies 
a decrease in spending for any reason could adversely affect the markets for our products and thereby adversely affect our revenue and margins and limit our future growth prospects 
moreover  these risks could cause increased instability in the financial and insurance markets and adversely affect our ability to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate or are required to obtain by our contracts with third parties 

table of contents we face risks related to natural disasters and pandemic diseases  which could materially and adversely disrupt our operations and affect travel required for our worldwide operations 
a portion of our business involves the movement of people and certain parts and supplies to or from foreign locations 
any restrictions on travel or shipments to and from foreign locations  due to the occurrence of natural disasters such as earthquakes  floods or hurricanes  or an epidemic or outbreak of diseases  including the recent hn flu  in these locations could significantly disrupt our operations and decrease our ability to provide services to our customers 
in addition  our local workforce could be affected by such an occurrence or outbreak which could also significantly disrupt our operations and decrease our ability to provide services to our customers 
risks associated with the oil and gas industry we face risks due to the cyclical nature of the energy industry and the corresponding credit risk of our customers 
changing political  economic or military circumstances throughout the energy producing regions of the world can impact the market price of oil and gas for extended periods of time 
as most of our accounts receivable are with customers involved in the oil and gas industry  any significant change in such circumstances could result in financial exposure in relation to affected customers 
fluctuations in the demand for and prices of oil and gas would negatively impact our business 
fluctuations in the demand for and prices of oil and gas impact the levels of drilling activity by our customers and potential customers 
the prices are primarily determined by supply  demand  government regulations relating to oil and gas production and processing  and international political events  none of which can be accurately predicted 
in times of declining activity  not only is there less opportunity for us to sell our products and services but there is increased competitive pressure that tends to reduce prices and therefore margins 
possible legislation and regulations related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas 
in december  the us environmental protection agency epa officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  which is a byproduct of the burning of refined oil products  and methane  which is a primary component of natural gas  and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings by the epa allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
in september  the epa had proposed two sets of regulations in anticipation of finalizing its findings that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and that could also lead to the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limitations in clean air act permits for certain stationary sources 
in addition  the epa issued a final rule in september requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas 
in addition  in june  the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of acesa  which would establish an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce us emissions of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane 
acesa would require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from levels by  and just over an reduction of such emissions by under this legislation  the epa would issue a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to certain major sources of greenhouse gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
the cost of these allowances would be expected to escalate significantly over time 
the net effect of acesa would be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil  refined petroleum products  and natural gas 
the us senate has begun work on its own legislation for restricting domestic greenhouse gas emissions  and the obama administration has indicated its support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system 
in addition  several states have considered initiatives to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emissions inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
although it is not possible at this time to predict when the us senate may act on climate change legislation or how any bill passed by the senate would be reconciled with acesa  any future federal or state laws or regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect the demand for the oil and natural gas 

table of contents our revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations period over period and are difficult to forecast 
our revenues and earnings may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon the level of drilling activity worldwide  as well as the particular geographic focus of the activity  the variability of customer orders  which are particularly unpredictable in international markets  the levels of inventories of our products held by end users and distributors  the mix of our products sold or leased and the margins on those products  new products offered and sold or leased by us or our competitors  weather conditions or other natural disasters that can affect our operations or our customers operations  changes in oil and gas prices and currency exchange rates  which in some cases affect the costs and prices for our products  the level of capital equipment project orders  which may vary with the level of new rig construction and refurbishment activity in the industry  changes in drilling and exploration plans which can be particularly volatile in international markets  the variability of customer orders or a reduction in customer orders  which may leave us with excess or obsolete inventories  and the ability to manufacture and timely deliver customer orders  particularly in the top drive segment due to the increasing size and complexity of our models 
in addition  our fixed costs cause our margins to decrease when demand is low and service capacity is underutilized 
any significant consolidation or loss of end user customers could have a negative impact on our business 
exploration and production company operators and drilling contractors have undergone substantial consolidation in recent years 
additional consolidation is probable 
in addition  many oil and gas properties could be transferred over time to different potential customers 
consolidation of drilling contractors results in fewer end users for our products and could result in the combined contractor standardizing its equipment preferences in favor of a competitor s products 
merger activity among both major and independent oil and gas companies also affects exploration  development and production activity  as these consolidated companies attempt to increase efficiency and reduce costs 
generally  only the more promising exploration and development projects from each merged entity are likely to be pursued  which may result in overall lower post merger exploration and development budgets 
moreover  some end users prefer not to use relatively new products or premium products in their drilling operations 
we operate in an intensively competitive industry and if we fail to compete effectively our business will suffer 
competitive risks may include decisions by existing competitors to attempt to increase market share by reducing prices and decisions by customers to adopt competing technologies 
the drilling industry is driven primarily by cost minimization 
our strategy is aimed at reducing drilling costs through the application of new technology 
our competitors  many of whom have a more diverse product line and access to greater amounts of capital  have the ability to compete against the cost savings generated by our technology by reducing prices and by introducing competing technologies 
our competitors may also have the ability to offer bundles of products and services to customers that we do not offer 
we have limited resources to sustain a prolonged price war and maintain the investment required to continue the commercialization and development of our new technologies 
to compete in our industry  we must continue to develop new technologies and products 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by continual technological developments and we have identified our products as providing technological advantages over other competitive products 
as a result  substantial improvements in the scope and quality of product function and performance can occur over a short period of time 
if we are not able to develop commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology  our business may be adversely affected 
our future ability to develop new products depends on our ability to 
table of contents design and commercially produce products that meet the needs of our customers  successfully market new products  and obtain and maintain patent protection 
we may encounter resource constraints  technical barriers  or other difficulties that would delay introduction of new products and services in the future 
our competitors may introduce new products or obtain patents before we do and achieve a competitive advantage 
additionally  the time and expense invested in product development may not result in commercial applications 
for example  from time to time  we have incurred significant losses in the development of new technologies which were not successful for various commercial or technical reasons 
if we are unable to successfully implement technological or research and engineering type activities  our growth prospects may be reduced and our future revenues may be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  we may experience operating losses after new products are introduced and commercialized because of high start up costs  unexpected manufacturing costs or problems  or lack of demand 
risks associated with our business we have been party to patent infringement claims and we may not be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
in three separate actions  we were sued by varco i p  inc varco  franks international  inc and weatherford international  who have alleged that our cds tool and other equipment and processes violate certain of their patents 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
we believe that these suits are without merit and we intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
in the event that we are not successful in defending ourselves in one or more of these matters  it may have a material adverse effect on our tubular services and casing drilling segments and  therefore  on our business 
in addition  in the future we may be subject to other infringement claims and if any of our products were found to be infringing  our consolidated financial results may be adversely affected 
some of our products and the processes used to produce them have been granted us and international patent protection  or have patent applications pending 
nevertheless  patents may not be granted from our applications and  if patents are issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
recent changes in us patent law may have the effect of making certain of our patents more likely to be the subject of claims for invalidation 
our competitors may be able to independently develop technology that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents 
this is especially true internationally where the protection of intellectual property rights may not be as effective 
in addition  obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection internationally may be significantly more expensive than doing so domestically 
we may have to spend substantial time and money defending our patents 
after our patents expire  our competitors will not be legally constrained from marketing products substantially similar to ours 
we are subject to legal proceedings and may  in the future  be subject to additional legal proceedings 
we are currently involved in legal proceedings described in part i  item legal proceedings 
from time to time  we may become subject to additional legal proceedings which may include contract  tort  intellectual property  tax  regulatory compliance and other claims 
we are also subject to complaints or allegations from former  current or prospective employees from time to time  alleging violations of employment related laws 
lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
restrictions imposed by our credit agreement may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs 
the amount of borrowings available under our credit agreement is limited by the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
decreases in our financial performance could prohibit us from borrowing available amounts under our revolver or could force us to make repayments of outstanding total debt in order to remain in compliance with our credit agreements 
these restrictions may negatively impact our ability to finance future operations  implement our business strategy or fund our capital needs 
compliance with these financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control  including the risks and uncertainties described in the other risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report 

table of contents our debt and other financing obligations restrict our ability to take certain actions and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios  failure to comply with these requirements could result in acceleration of our debt 
our debt and other financing obligations contain restrictive covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants could preclude us or our subsidiaries from issuing letters of credit  from borrowing under our credit agreements and could accelerate our debt and other financing obligations and those of our subsidiaries 
if this were to occur  we might not be able to repay such debt and other financing obligations 
additionally  our credit agreements are collateralized by equity interests in our subsidiaries 
a breach of the covenants under these agreements could permit the lenders to exercise their rights to foreclose on these collateral interests 
we have outstanding debt that is not contracted at market rates 
our credit facility contains provisions for interest rates on borrowings and commitment fees that were established prior to the credit crisis and probably could not be replaced at the same value in today s market 
if we needed to replace our credit facility in today s uncertain bank loan market  for any reason  including an event of default on our part  we may be unable to negotiate lending terms at the same rates  or for the same borrowing capacity  that we currently hold 
any change in the terms of our fees or borrowing capacity could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
at this time it is difficult to forecast the future state of the bank loan market 
as a result of the uncertain state of various financial institutions and the credit markets generally  we may be unable to maintain our current borrowing capacity in the event of bank or banks failure to fund any commitments under the current credit facility  and we may not be able to refinance our bank facility in the same amount and on the same terms as we currently hold  which could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 
we provide warranties on our products and if our products fail to operate properly our business will suffer 
we provide warranties as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of the equipment we manufacture 
our products are often deployed in harsh environments including subsea applications 
the failure of these products to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services  replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to a customer 
we have in the past experienced quality problems with raw material vendors  which required us to recall and replace certain equipment and components 
we have also in the past received warranty claims and we expect to continue to receive them in the future 
such claims may exceed the reserve we have set aside for them 
to the extent that we incur substantial warranty claims in any period because of quality issues with our products  our reputation  ability to obtain future business and earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
concentration of our revenue and management in the united states involves risk 
in approximately of our revenue was obtained from operations in the us compared to during 
the concentration of revenue and management functions in the us involves certain risks  including the following increased vulnerability to fluctuations in the us economy  in particular  a severe economic downturn or prolonged recession in the us could have a greater impact on our ability to do business than would otherwise be the case  fluctuations in the valuation of the us dollar  particularly in relation to the canadian dollar  may negatively impact our financial results 
future devaluation of the us dollar could increase our canadian manufacturing costs and our cost of doing business outside of the us in general and it may not be possible to raise the prices and rates we charge customers in us dollars to compensate for these increased costs  or to hedge our exposure to devaluation of the us dollar through currency swaps and other financial instruments  and the us limits the number of visas available to us professionals and executives who wish to work in the us the potential inability to obtain such a visa may prevent us from transferring our non us employees to the us  or may restrict our ability to recruit qualified international executives to fill management positions at our corporate headquarters 
our business operations in countries outside the united states are subject to a number of us federal laws and regulations  including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control and the commerce department 
our business operations in countries outside the united states are subject to a number of us federal laws and regulations  including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac and the commerce department 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we could be exposed to claims for damages  financial penalties  reputational harm  and incarceration of our employees or restrictions on our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents our foreign operations and investments involve special risks 
we sell products and provide services in parts of the world where the political and legal systems are very different from those in the united states and canada 
in places like russia  latin america  the middle east and asia pacific  we may have difficulty or extra expense in navigating the local bureaucracies and legal systems 
we may face challenges in enforcing contracts in local courts or be at a disadvantage when we have a dispute with a customer that is an agency of the state 
we may be at a disadvantage to competitors that are not subject to the same international trade and business practice restrictions that us and canadian laws impose on us 
while diversification is desirable  it can expose us to risks related to cultural  political and economic factors of foreign jurisdictions which are beyond our control 
as a general rule  we have elected not to carry political risk insurance against these risks 
such risks include the following loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as wars or insurrection  the effects of currency fluctuations and exchange controls  such as devaluation of foreign currencies and other economic problems  changes or interpretations in laws  regulations and policies of foreign governments  including those associated with changes in the governing parties  nationalization  and expropriation  and protracted delays in securing government consents  permits  licenses  or other regulatory approvals necessary to conduct our operations 
we are subject to foreign exchange and currency risks 
we operate internationally  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that transactions are not denominated in us dollars 
we typically endeavor to denominate all of our contracts in us dollars to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
however  inflation and future devaluations in foreign currencies could adversely impact our operations and financial results 
a portion of our accounts receivable as of december  was denominated in venezuelan currency 
effective january   the venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two tier exchange structure 
we expect this devaluation will have an impact to our results of operations for the upcoming quarterly period ended march  our profitability is driven to a large extent by our ability to deliver the products we manufacture in a timely manner 
disruptions to our production schedule may adversely impact our ability to meet delivery commitments 
if we fail to deliver products according to contract terms  we may suffer financial penalties and a diminution of our commercial reputation and future product orders 
we rely on the availability of raw materials  component parts and finished products to produce our products 
we buy raw materials  components and precision machining or sub assembly services from many different vendors located in canada  the united states  europe  south east asia and the middle east 
the price and lead times for some products have fluctuated along with the general changes of steel prices around the world 
we also source a substantial amount of electrical components  including permanent magnet motors and drives as well as a substantial amount of hydraulic components  including hydraulic motors  from suppliers located in the us the inability of suppliers to meet performance  quality specifications and delivery schedules could cause delays in manufacturing and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet outstanding orders or accept new orders for the manufacture of the affected equipment 
the design of some of our equipment is based on components provided by specific sole source manufacturers 
some of our products have been designed around components which are only available from one source of supply 
in some cases  a manufacturer has developed or modified the design of a component at our request  and consequently we are the only purchaser of such items 
if the manufacturer of such an item should go out of business or cease or refuse to manufacture the component in question  or raise the price of such components unduly  we may have to identify alternative components and redesign portions of our equipment 
this could cause delays in manufacturing and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet outstanding orders or accept new orders for the manufacture of the affected equipment 
our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and key employees  and the loss of such employees could result in the failure to implement our business plans 
as a technology based company  we depend upon skilled engineering and other professionals in order to engage in product innovation and ensure the effective implementation of our innovative technology  especially casing drilling 
we compete for these professionals  not only with other companies in the same industry  but with oil and gas service companies generally and other industries 
in periods of high energy and industrial manufacturing activity  demand for the skills and expertise of these professionals increases  which can make the hiring and retention of these individuals more difficult and expensive 
failure to recruit and retain such individuals may result in our inability to maintain a competitive advantage over other companies and loss of customer satisfaction 

table of contents the loss or incapacity of certain key employees for any reason  including our president and chief executive officer  julio m 
quintana  could have a negative impact on our ability to implement our business plan due to the specialized knowledge these individuals possess 
our business relies on the skills and availability of trained and experienced trades and technicians to provide efficient and necessary services to us and our customers 
hiring and retaining such individuals are critical to the success of our business plan 
retention of staff and the prevention of injury to staff are essential in order to provide high level of service 
our products and services are used in hazardous conditions  and we are subject to risks relating to potential liability claims 
most of our products are used in hazardous drilling and production applications where an accident or a failure of a product can have catastrophic consequences 
for example  the unexpected failure of a top drive to rotate a drill string during drilling operations could result in the loss of control over a well  leading to blowout and the discharge of pollutants into the environment 
damages arising from an occurrence at a location where our products are used have in the past and may in the future result in the assertion of potentially large claims against us 
while we attempt to limit our exposure to such risks through contracts with our customers  these measures may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events  including blowouts  cratering  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment  damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters  and losses resulting from business interruption 
our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a self insured retention  and may not be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur 
the occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against  or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations  could result in substantial losses 
moreover  we may not be able in the future to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate 
any significant claims made under our policies will likely cause our premiums to increase 
any future damages caused by our products or services that are not covered by insurance  are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles  could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 
environmental compliance and remediation costs and the costs of environmental liabilities could exceed our estimates 
the energy industry is affected by changes in public policy  federal  state and local laws and regulations 
the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic  environmental and other policy reasons may adversely affect our operations due to our customers having limited drilling and other opportunities in the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
the operations of our customers  as well as our properties  are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and workplace safety 
we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls 
our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of december  as a result  this form k includes an adverse opinion from pricewatehousecoopers llp  our independent registered public accounting firm  on our internal control over financial reporting 
a description of the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting is included in item a  controls and procedures  in this form k 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
the material weakness resulted in misstatements of the deferred tax assets  the income tax provision  foreign exchange gains and losses  cumulative translation adjustments accounts and related financial disclosures 
the material weakness also resulted in restatements of the company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the quarters ended march   june  and september  and resulted in audit adjustments to the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  additionally  inadequate internal control over financial reporting could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading of our securities

we have obtained final court rulings deciding all years in dispute in our favor  except for as discussed below  and and  both of which are currently before the mexican tax court 
the outcome of such appeals is uncertain 
however  we recorded an accrual of million during for our anticipated exposure on these issues million related to interest and penalties was included in other income and million was included in income tax expense 
we continue to believe that the basis for these reassessments was incorrect  and that the ultimate resolution of those outstanding matters that remain will likely not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
