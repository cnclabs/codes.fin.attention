overview our corporate mission is to provide energy for the future by exploring for  developing new  and re establishing pre existing sources of energy worldwide 
we are currently exploring for oil and gas offshore guinea  west africa 
we devote a substantial portion of our efforts to obtaining additional psc participants to help fund our exploration and development of sub surface hydrocarbons in commercial quantities offshore guinea 
we intend to continue acquiring  exploring and developing oil and gas properties on a global basis 
at this time we have no source of operating revenue and there is no assurance when we will  if ever 
we have limited cash and require substantial additional funds to fulfill our business plans 
our operating plan within the next months includes the following obtaining funds and completing technical work and planning with dana and prospective participants in our concession to drill offshore guinea in late acquiring  processing and interpreting the d seismic survey which began in august this will allow for identification of one or more proposed drilling locations 
adding one or more additional psc participants to operate and help fund our search for oil and gas deposits on our guinea concession 
we expect that adding a psc participant will include the assignment of a portion of our interest in the concession to such participant 
assignment of participating interest on december   we entered into a sale and purchase agreement spa with dana petroleum e p limited dana for dana to acquire a participation interest in the psc 
on january   the company closed on the transaction with dana assigning it a minority interest in our concession offshore guinea 
in connection with the closing of the transaction  we entered into an assignment of participating interest the assignment with dana  a deed of assignment and joint operating agreement joa 
pursuant to the assignment  we assigned to dana an undivided of our participating interest in the contractual interests  rights  obligations and duties under the psc 
as required by the psc  the deed of assignment was delivered as the necessary notice of the assignment to be given to the ministry of mines  energy and hydraulics of guinea 
as part of the obligation to bear the proportionate share of costs  the spa required dana to make a cash payment to us upon closing the assignment of the participating interest to dana in the amount of million for dana s pro rata portion of accrued expenditures associated with our marine d seismic data acquisition program within the contract area 
the million payment was received by us on february  and was recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of our concession 
the operating agreement appoints us as the operator for purposes of conducting oil and gas exploration and production activities within the retained contract area 
we share operating costs of joint operations with dana in proportion to the parties respective participating interests hyperdynamics   dana  
an operating committee and voting procedures are established in the joa whereby managerial and technical representatives of the company and dana make decisions regarding joint operations  exploration and appraisal of commercial discoveries  and the disposition of commercial production 
the joa places restrictions upon the transfer of the parties respective participating interests in the form of a right of first purchase that is triggered by a proposed transfer or certain changes in control of us or dana 
in may  we received an administrative order from the ministry of mines and geology of guinea  referred to as an arr t  confirming the guinea government s approval of the assignment of a participating interest in the psc  as amended  to dana 
on may   we received a payment of million in cash from dana  which was recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of our guinea concession  as payment for the assigned participating interest in the contractual interests  rights  obligations and duties under the psc  as amended 
repsol letter of intent on january   we entered into an amendment to the agreement for exclusive dealing and letter of intent amended loi with repsol exploracion  sa  repsol 
this amended loi extended the term of the agreement for exclusive dealing and letter of intent original loi that was entered into between the parties on november   from january  until march   which date has not been further extended 
the original loi contemplated the prospective acquisition by repsol of an undivided participation interest in our concession off the coast of guinea 
under the provisions of the original loi  repsol committed to make certain seismic acquisition payments to us upon the closing of the assignment of a participation interest in the concession 
under and for the consideration of the amended loi  repsol paid million to us  representing repsol s pro rata share of work preformed to date under the marine d seismic data acquisition services agreement with bergen oilfield services bos agreement 
the million payment was received by us on february  in addition  following our delivery of an invoice to repsol for subsequent work performed under the bos agreement  repsol paid its pro rata share of such invoice  which was approximately million 
these payments totaling million  which also represented the consideration paid by repsol for extending the loi to march   were recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of our guinea concession 
under the loi we were not required to reimburse any payments to repsol upon the loi expiry on march  and repsol has no continuing rights to acquire a participation interest 
sources of financing during the year ended june  on november   we entered into a shares purchase agreement with enable growth partners  lp enable  which then held certain securities that were previously issued by us 
pursuant to the shares purchase agreement  we issued to enable  shares of our common stock 
the aggregate net proceeds from the offering  after deducting offering expenses payable by us  were approximately million 
the offering closed on november  on december   we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  together with warrants to purchase a total of million shares of common stock to institutional investors for gross proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds to us from the offering  after deducting placement agent fees and our offering expenses  were approximately million 
the offering closed on december  on april   we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell an aggregate of  shares of its common stock  together with warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock to institutional investors for gross proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds to us from the offering  after deducting placement agent fees and our offering expenses  were approximately million 
the offering closed on april  upon obtaining the republic of guinea presidential decree for the psc amendment and an arr te in may that officially allowed dana petroleum to participate in the psc  dana paid us an additional purchase price of million in cash and assumed its share of costs for all operations 
dana paid their share of the completed bergen oilfield services d seismic program 
on january   we extended the terms of the loi with repsol until march  as consideration for extending the loi  repsol paid us million for their pro rata share of work performed to date and planned work on our d seismic program 
in february and march  enable exercised  warrants at per warrant  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
analysis of changes in financial position our current assets increased by  from  on june  to  on june  the most significant factor in the increase is our cash account  which increased from  at june   to  at june   due to the sources of financing as described above 
our long term assets decreased  or  from  on june   to  on june  this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in the carrying value of our unevaluated oil and gas properties in guinea resulting from the assignment of a participation interest to dana 
upon receipt of the million from dana in may  we reduced our investment in unevaluated oil and gas properties in guinea to zero  with the remainder of the proceeds being recorded as a gain on the sale of this participation interest 
therefore our investment in unevaluated oil and gas properties in guinea as of june  was  which represents capitalized costs incurred in june on may   scs the wholly owned subsidiary of the company  entered into a release and settlement agreement and amendment to contract the settlement agreement with geophysical service inc gsi 
pursuant to the settlement agreement we paid gsi  in cash on may  in settlement of a dispute between the parties that arose from the master geophysical data acquisition agreement between scs and gsi mgda agreement 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the parties terminated the mgda agreement and also granted mutual releases to one another concerning further payments and disputes arising from or related to the services provided by gsi to scs under the mgda agreement 
our current liabilities increased  or  from  on june  to  on june  the main factor in the increase is accounts payable and accrued expenses  which increased from  at june   to  at june  accounts payable at june   included amounts payable related primarily to our investments in our guinea concession  increased corporate activities and accrued employee bonus expense 
the increases in accounts payable were partially offset by a decrease in the variable share issuance obligation and dividends payable as these two liabilities totaling  were settled in our long term liabilities decreased  from  as of june   to  as of june   due primarily to the  of long term debt that was on the balance sheet as of june  being paid or converted into common shares during this debt related to the sale of  in convertible debentures in september results of operations based on the factors discussed below for our international segment  discontinued operations and for corporate overhead  the net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended june   decreased  or  to a net loss of  or per share in the period from a net loss of  or per share in the period 
the net loss is comprised of the net loss from operations for our corporate office of  the net loss of scs of  and income from discontinued operations of  the net loss attributable to common shareholders includes a provision for preferred stock dividends of  in reportable segments we have one reportable segment our international operations in guinea conducted through our subsidiary scs 
scs is engaged in oil and gas exploration activities pertaining to offshore guinea 
during the year ended june   our domestic operations were discontinued  and as of august  all the assets associated with hyd  which was our domestic subsidiary that held certain properties located in louisiana  have been sold 
results of operations comparison for fiscal year and revenues 
there were no revenues for the years ended june  and we have focused on the acquisition and interpretation of seismic data for our concession in guinea 
depreciation 
depreciation increased  or  due to additional depreciation associated with assets placed in service in depreciation expense was  and  in the years ended june  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of  or  the increase was primarily employee related costs  which include salaries  bonuses and stock based compensation related to options granted to new employees and others 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
during the period  the company recognized a  gain on sale of a participation interest in unevaluated oil and gas properties resulting from the participation interest in our guinea concession being assigned to dana petroleum 
this gain was recognized in may and represented the excess of the million proceeds received over the amount of our investment in guinea as of that date 
also in  the company recognized a non cash gain on the derivative liability related to the ya global warrants of   of which was unrealized gain on the change in fair value of the liability and  loss which was related to the exercise of warrants classified as derivative liabilities 
no such gains were recognized in the period 
interest expense was  for the period  versus  for the period 
the higher interest expense in the was primarily attributable to the early conversion of convertible debentures outstanding during the period and the expensing of the associated debt discount 
during the period  the company recognized a loss on extinguishment of the remaining convertible debenture balance of  primarily attributable to the expensing of the remaining discount associated with these debentures  versus a loss of  in the period  primarily attributable to the early extinguishment of the ya global debenture that resulted in a loss of  partially offset by a gain on settlement of a debt obligation for less than the accrued amount 
loss from continuing operations 
based on the items discussed above  our loss from continuing operations decreased by  or  from  in the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  discontinued operations 
discontinued operations generated income of  for the period and income of  for the period 
liquidity and capital resources going concern considerations the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  includes an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million for the period from inception to june  as of june   we had cash on hand of million  short term debt of million and we have working capital of approximately million 
most of our cash on hand is secured by a million letter of credit that will be used to fund the pgs d seismic acquisition and processing that is currently in progress 
we require significant additional funding to sustain our current operations and further our business plan 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional funding in order to finance our planned operations 
we have historically been able to raise capital from the sale of a minority interest in the concession  and the issuance of debt or equity to finance our activities 
capital may not be available on the terms and conditions acceptable to us or at all 
our plan to resolve the uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern includes monetization of our oil and gas exploration assets by attracting additional participants in the exploration of the concession 
we expect that entering into additional partnering relationships would entail transferring a portion of our interest in the concession to such participant 
if we are unable to timely conclude a transaction involving the concession  we may seek equity or debt financing 
liquidity on june   we had  in cash and  in liabilities 
the liabilities include current liabilities of  and long term liabilities of  net cash used in operating activities for continuing operations for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june  cash provided by investing activities for continuing operations for the year ended june  was  compared to  used by investing activities in the year ended june  there was net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  of  while net cash of  was provided by financing activities during the year ended june  liquidity effects of discontinued operations on april   we executed a contract to sell all of our working interests in our us domestic oil and gas properties for  the third and final installment under the agreement was completed in august the cash flows from discontinued operations are separately reported in the audited consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented 
while this transaction improved our short term liquidity  it also eliminated our sole revenue source 
accordingly  the liquidity implication of the discontinued operations is that we will require additional funding from debt or equity sources or from an additional participant in the guinea concession in order to continue operations 
critical accounting policies we account for oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
accordingly  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of proved oil and natural gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and annual lease rentals are capitalized 
all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred 
sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change  or to the extent that the sale proceeds exceed our capitalized costs 
depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  net of tax considerations 
in accordance with sec release  prices based on the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month  or prices defined by existing contractual arrangements  are used in deriving future net revenues discounted at  net of tax 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
costs excluded costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs incurred should be transferred to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 
we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
we assess our unevaluated properties on a country by country basis 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
however  if proved reserves have not yet been established in a full cost pool  these costs are charged against earnings 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
ceiling test the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule under full cost accounting rules for each cost center  capitalized costs of proved properties  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  shall not exceed an amount the cost ceiling equal to the sum of a the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves  based on current operating conditions  discounted at percent  plus b the cost of properties not being amortized  plus c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  less d any income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged as an impairment expense 
as of june  and  we have no capitalized cost in oil and gas properties that are subject to the ceiling test for impairment 
impairment at june    we had  of capitalized costs associated with our guinea operations 
based on an impairment analysis performed by management and the completion of work requirements under the psc amendment no 
and mou  no impairment of these assets was indicated as of june  environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change our estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  or changes in their interpretation or administration  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from our estimates 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations represent our best estimate of the fair value of our future abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties  including the costs of removal and disposition of tangible equipment  site and environmental restoration 
we estimate the fair value of our retirement costs in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
the determination of the fair value of an asset retirement obligation generally involves estimating the fair value of the obligation at the end of the property s useful life and then discounting it to present value using our credit adjusted  risk free rate of return 
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding the expected removal and site restoration costs  timing and present value discount rates 
changes in the estimated useful life and the fair value of the asset retirement obligation are imprecise since the removal activities will generally occur several years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental and safety considerations that may ultimately impact the amount of the obligations 
fair value of our debt and equity transactions many of our various debt and equity transactions require us to determine the fair value of a debt or equity instrument in order to properly record the transaction in our financial statements 
fair value is generally determined by applying widely acceptable valuation models  eg  the black scholes and binomial lattice valuation models using the trading price of the underlying instrument or by comparison to instruments with comparable maturities and terms 
share based compensation we follow asc which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award presumptively the vesting period 
asc also requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we account for non employee share based awards based upon the provisions of asc  equity based payments to non employees 
contractual commitments and obligations we have a contingent  note payable that is only payable with of the profits of scs corporation 
we have the right to pay this note off using common stock 
disclosure of contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years installment obligations operating lease obligations seismic contracts total the company expects its share to be of the seismic contract amounts 
on june   we entered into an agreement for the supply of marine seismic data with pgs geophysical as  norway pgs  a copy of which is included as an exhibit to this report on form k 
the overall cost of the survey is estimated to be million  including mobilization and demobilization expenses 
we expect our share of the cost to be of that amount 
under the terms of the d seismic contract  we secured a letter of credit in the amount of million for the sole purpose of funding this seismic acquisition 
as work is performed and invoiced  pgs will submit draw documents to the institution the letter of credit is with for payment of invoices 
the letter of credit is through amegy bank na and the letter of credit reimbursement agreement was entered into on july  the letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit  which was funded in the amount of million on july  and bears interest at a rate of per annum 
we will incur an issuance fee with respect to the letter of credit computed at the rate of per annum on the daily average amount available to be drawn under the letter of credit from and including the date of issuance until the stated expiry date payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each calendar quarter end commencing september  in addition  with respect to each draft paid  we will pay the bank a transaction fee in the amount of  an advising fee in the amount of and a swift fee in the amount of a copy of all the agreements pertaining to this letter of credit are included as exhibits to this report on form k 
on july   we entered into an agreement for the processing of d marine seismic data with pgs data processing  inc under the terms of this contract  pgs agreed to provide data processing and other geophysical services in connection with the processing of data acquired from our d seismic survey 
the estimated cost of this e d processing contract is approximately million 
we expect our share of the cost to be of that amount 
a copy of this contract is included as an exhibit to this report on form k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we have some foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from our in country office in guinea 
us dollars are accepted in guinea and many of our purchases and purchase obligations  such as our office lease in guinea  are denominated in us dollars 
however  our costs for labor  supplies  and fuel could increase if the guinea franc significantly appreciates against the us dollar 
we do not hedge the exposure to currency rate changes
