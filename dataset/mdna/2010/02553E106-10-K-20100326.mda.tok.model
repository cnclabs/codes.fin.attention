item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes thereto 
this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following the planned opening of new american eagle stores  new aerie stores  and five new kids stores in the united states and canada during fiscal  the selection of approximately american eagle stores in the united states and canada for remodeling during fiscal  the planned closure of to american eagle stores in the united states and canada during fiscal  the planned opening of two new franchised american eagle stores in the middle east during fiscal  the planned closure of all martin osa stores and cessation of all online and corporate operations for the brand in fiscal  the success of aerie by american eagle and aerie 
com  the success of kids by american eagle and kids 
com  the expected payment of a dividend in future periods  the possibility of growth through acquisitions  internally developing additional new brands  and or engaging in future franchise agreements  the possibility that we may be required to take additional temporary impairment charges or net impairment losses recognized in earnings relating to our investment securities  the possibility that the amounts drawn on our demand borrowing agreements will be called for repayment and that the facilities may not be available for future borrowings  and the possibility that we may be required to take additional store impairment charges related to underperforming stores 
we caution that these forward looking statements  and those described elsewhere in this report  involve material risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors beyond our control  as discussed within part i  item a of this form k 
accordingly  our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statement 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believe them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
our e commerce operation records revenue upon the estimated customer receipt date of the merchandise 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase  and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 

table of contents revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
the estimated sales return reserve is based on projected merchandise returns determined through the use of historical average return percentages 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
during fiscal  we discontinued assessing a service fee on inactive gift cards 
as a result  we estimate gift card breakage and recognize revenue in proportion to actual gift card redemptions as a component of net sales 
we determine an estimated gift card breakage rate by continuously evaluating historical redemption data and the time when there is a remote likelihood that a gift card will be redeemed 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
the company records merchandise receipts at the time merchandise is delivered to the foreign shipping port by the manufacturer fob port 
this is the point at which title and risk of loss transfer to the company 
we review our inventory in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear merchandise 
additionally  we estimate a markdown reserve for future planned markdowns related to current inventory 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
we estimate an inventory shrinkage reserve for anticipated losses for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve is calculated based on historical percentages and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve 
however  if actual physical inventory losses differ significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
asset impairment 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc  property  plant  and equipment  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  over its remaining useful life  to the carrying value 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the asset value to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded as a component of operating income under loss on impairment of assets 
our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
investment securities 
in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  we measure our investment securities using level  level and level inputs 
level and level inputs are valued using quoted market prices while we use a discounted cash flow dcf model to determine the fair value of our level investments 
the assumptions in our dcf model include different recovery periods depending on the type of security and varying discount factors for yield and illiquidity 
these assumptions are subjective and they are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions 
the use of different assumptions would result in a different valuation and related charge 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional net impairment loss recognized in earnings in the future 
any such charge could materially affect our results of operations 

table of contents we evaluate our investments for impairment in accordance with asc  investments debt and equity securities asc 
asc provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
as of may   we adopted asc  transition related to fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments asc  which modifies the requirements for recognizing other than temporary impairment otti and changes the impairment model for debt securities 
in addition  asc requires additional disclosures relating to debt and equity securities both in the interim and annual periods as well as requires us to present total otti in the consolidated statements of operations  with an offsetting reduction for any non credit loss impairment amount recognized in other comprehensive income oci 
share based payments 
we account for share based payments in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term and the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term 
we calculate a weighted average expected term based on historical experience 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility 
we chose to use a combination of historical and implied volatility as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we calculate income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as computed pursuant to asc deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates  based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance  in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
changes in our level and composition of earnings  tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as the results of tax audits may materially impact the effective tax rate 
effective february   we adopted the accounting pronouncement now codified in asc regarding accounting for unrecognized tax benefits 
this pronouncement prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
under asc  a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position and to establish a valuation allowance require management to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowances or net income 

table of contents key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which are considered key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
in fiscal years following those with weeks  including fiscal  the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks 
a store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation 
however  stores that have a gross square footage increase of or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable store sales base  but are included in total sales 
these stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the remodel 
sales from american eagle  aerie and martin osa stores are included in comparable store sales 
sales from aeo direct are not included in comparable store sales 
our management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies  rent  etc 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise and achieving an optimal level of sales 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs  as well as markdowns  shrinkage  certain promotional costs and buying  occupancy and warehousing costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing costs consist of compensation  employee benefit expenses and travel for our buyers and certain senior merchandising executives  rent and utilities related to our stores  corporate headquarters  distribution centers and other office space  freight from our distribution centers to the stores  compensation and supplies for our distribution centers  including purchasing  receiving and inspection costs  and shipping and handling costs related to our e commerce operation 
the inability to obtain acceptable levels of sales  initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating income our management views operating income as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses and our level of capital expenditures 
store productivity store productivity  including net sales per average square foot  sales per productive hour  average unit retail price  conversion rate  the number of transactions per store  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by our management in assessing our operational performance 
inventory turnover our management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is bought and sold 
inventory turnover is important as it can signal slow moving inventory 
this can be critical in determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise 
cash flow and liquidity our management evaluates cash flow from operations  investing and financing in determining the sufficiency of our cash position 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of cash 
our management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
results of operations overview fiscal started with numerous challenges  including a difficult consumer environment  which impacted store traffic and transaction volume 
this  combined with weak demand for ae merchandise  resulted in a sales and earnings decline during the first two quarters of fiscal compared to fiscal we made improvements to our product assortments and business stabilized  particularly during the second half of the year 
although third quarter operating results declined compared to  we began to see an improved customer response to certain core 
table of contents categories such as ae jeans and graphic t shirts 
the business continued to strengthen with the holiday merchandise assortment  driving fourth quarter sales and earnings increases compared to fiscal net sales of approximately billion increased slightly compared to fiscal annual comparable store sales decreased 
a higher merchandise margin reflected lower markdowns  due to the improvement during the fall and holiday seasons 
buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses increased as a result of rent related to new store growth 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased 
expense reductions in advertising and travel were offset by the accrual of incentive costs  which were not earned in fiscal operating income as a percent to net sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal  net income decreased to million

table of contents gross profit gross profit decreased to billion from billion in fiscal gross profit as a percent to net sales decreased by basis points to from last year

table of contents provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate decreased to approximately in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of the tax benefit associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings from canada as well as federal and state income tax settlements and other changes in income tax reserves 
additionally  the effective income tax rate was higher in fiscal primarily as a result of the impairment charge recorded in connection with the valuation of certain ars and auction rate preferred securities arps in which no income tax benefit was recognized

buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses increased basis points as a percent to net sales 
this was primarily due to a basis point increase in rent as a percent to net sales  driven by new store openings and the negative comparable store sales  as well as higher utilities

table of contents martin osa fiscal results of operations on march   our board approved management s recommendation to proceed with the closure m o 
we notified employees and issued a press release announcing this decision on march  the decision to take this action resulted from an extensive evaluation of the brand and review of strategic alternatives  which revealed that it was not achieving performance levels that warranted further investment 
in fiscal  m o recorded net sales from store and online operations of approximately million and generated an after tax loss of approximately million  including a non cash impairment charge of approximately million  net of tax 
the results of operations include store  online  corporate and other expenses directly attributable to m o operations 
fiscal outlook looking ahead  we expect consumers to remain cautious and highly sensitive to pricing 
however  our outlook for fiscal is more favorable than for fiscal  based on improvements across merchandising and design 
we believe that on trend merchandise assortments  more frequent flow of new merchandise and strong value offerings should drive sales and earnings growth 
we are continuing to control expenses and have planned capital spending below fiscal we believe that our current cash holdings and cash generated from operations in fiscal will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
fair value measurements asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under asc as the exit price associated with the sale of an asset or transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we have adopted the provisions of asc as of february   for our items measured at fair value on a recurring basis  which include ars 
we have adopted the provisions of asc as of february  for items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  including goodwill and property and equipment 
additionally  we adopted the provisions of asc as of may  for our financial instruments measured at fair value 
financial instruments valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  asc establishes this three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs ie projections  estimates  interpretations  etc 
that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
as of january   we held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these include cash equivalents and short and long term investments  including ars 

table of contents in accordance with asc  the following table represents the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets cash equivalents and investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of january  fair value measurements at january  quoted market prices in active significant carrying amount markets for significant other unobservable as of january  identical assets observable inputs inputs level level level in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash commercial paper treasury bills money market total cash and cash equivalents short term investments student loan backed ars state and local government ars total short term investments long term investments student loan backed ars state and local government ars auction rate preferred securities total long term investments total percent to total we used a discounted cash flow dcf model to value our level investments 
the assumptions in our model included different recovery periods  ranging from year to years  depending on the type of security and varying discount factors for yield  ranging from to  and illiquidity  ranging from to 
these assumptions are subjective 
they are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions 
the use of different assumptions would result in a different valuation and related charge 
for example  an increase in the recovery period by one year would reduce the fair value of our investment in ars by approximately million 
an increase to the discount rate and illiquidity premium of basis points would reduce the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately million 
as a result of the discounted cash flow analysis for fiscal  we recorded a net recovery of million million  net of tax which reduced the total cumulative impairment recognized in other comprehensive income oci as of january  to million million  net of tax from million million  net of tax at the end of fiscal the reversal of temporary impairment was primarily driven by calls at par for the company s private insured student loan ars 
as a result of the settlements  the securities which were previously impaired were revalued at par 
these amounts were recorded in oci and resulted in an increase in the investments estimated fair values 
the net increase in fair value was partially offset by million of net impairment loss recognized in earnings during fiscal as a result of credit rating downgrades 

table of contents the following table presents a rollforward of the amount of net impairment loss recognized in earnings related to credit losses for the year ended january  in thousands beginning balance of credit losses previously recognized in earnings year to date otti credit losses recognized in earnings ending balance of cumulative credit losses recognized in earnings the reconciliation of our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level is as follows level unobservable inputs student loan auction backed rate auction auction rate municipal rate preferred total securities securities securities in thousands carrying value at january  settlements gains and losses reported in earnings reported in oci balance at january  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investment securities  including a description of the securities and a discussion of the uncertainties relating to their liquidity 
non financial assets our non financial assets  which include goodwill and property and equipment  are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
however  if certain triggering events occur  or if an annual impairment test is required and we are required to evaluate the non financial instrument for impairment  a resulting asset impairment would require that the non financial asset be recorded at the estimated fair value 
resulting from our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of january   we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
additionally  certain long lived assets were measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis using level inputs as defined in asc based on our review of the operating performance and projections of underperforming stores  we determined that certain underperforming stores would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of the related leases to recover our initial investment in them 
the estimated fair value of those stores was determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest 
we estimate future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the store is located 
during fiscal  certain long lived assets with a carrying value of million  primarily related to m o stores  were determined to be unable to recover their respective carrying values and  therefore  were written down to their estimated fair value  resulting in a loss on impairment of assets of million 
liquidity and capital resources our uses of cash are generally for working capital  the construction of new stores and remodeling of existing stores  information technology upgrades  distribution center improvements and expansion  the purchase of both short and long term investments  the repurchase of common stock and the payment of dividends 
historically  these uses of cash have been funded with cash flow from operations and existing cash on hand 
additionally  our uses of cash include the completion of our new corporate headquarters  the development of aerie by american eagle and 
table of contents the development of kids by american eagle 
we expect to be able to fund our future cash requirements through current cash holdings as well as cash generated from operations 
in the future  we expect that our uses of cash will also include further development of aerie by american eagle and kids by american eagle 
our growth strategy includes internally developing new brands and the possibility of further franchising arrangements or acquisitions 
we periodically consider and evaluate these options to support future growth 
in the event we do pursue such options  we could require additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in closing any potential transaction  or that any endeavor we undertake would increase our profitability 
the following sets forth certain measures of our liquidity january  january  working capital in s current ratio the increase of our working capital and current ratio as of january  compared to january   is primarily related to an increase in cash and cash equivalents as a result of cash from operations as well as the liquidation of long term investments 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal and million during fiscal our major source of cash from operations was merchandise sales 
our primary outflows of cash from operations were for the purchase of inventory and operational costs 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of million from the prior year was driven primarily by an increase in accrued compensation due to incentive compensation accruals during fiscal as well as an increase in prepaid taxes due to the timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities for fiscal included million for capital expenditures partially offset by million from the sale of investments classified as available for sale 
investing activities for fiscal included million from the net sale of investments classified as available for sale  partially offset by million for capital expenditures 
investing activities for fiscal primarily included million for the net sale of investments classified as available for sale as well as million for capital expenditures 
we invest our cash primarily in liquid money market funds 
we also have investments  made under our prior investment policy  in auction rate and auction rate preferred securities  with an original contractual maturity of up to years and an expected rate of return of approximately a taxable equivalent yield 
all investments made under our new investment policy must have a highly liquid secondary market at the time of purchase and an effective maturity not exceeding two years 
cash flows from financing activities during fiscal  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million used for the payment of dividends and the partial repayment of million in borrowings against our demand line of credit 
during fiscal  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million used for the payment of dividends partially offset by million in borrowings against our demand line of credit 
during fiscal  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million used for the repurchase of our common stock as part of our publicly announced repurchase program and million used for the payment of dividends 
asc requires that cash flows resulting from the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost for share based payments be classified as financing cash flows 
accordingly  for fiscal 
table of contents and  the excess tax benefit from share based payments of million  million and million  respectively  are classified as financing cash flows 
capital expenditures fiscal capital expenditures were million  which reflected a significant reduction compared to fiscal capital expenditures of million 
fiscal expenditures included million related to investments in our ae stores  including new ae and aerie stores in the united states and canada  remodeled stores in the united states and fixtures and visual investments 
additionally  we continued to support our infrastructure growth by investing in home office projects including the construction of our corporate headquarters in pittsburgh  pennsylvania million  the expansion and improvement of our distribution centers million and information technology million 
for fiscal  we will continue with our reduced spending plan 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million with approximately half of the amount relating to store growth and renovation 
credit facilities we have borrowing agreements with four separate financial institutions under which we may borrow an aggregate of million united states dollars usd and million canadian dollars cad 
of this amount  million usd can be used for demand letter of credit facilities  million usd and million cad can be used for demand line borrowings and the remaining million usd can be used for either letters of credit or demand line borrowings at our discretion 
the million usd of demand line credit is comprised of two facilities each with million usd of borrowing capacity 
the expiration dates of the two demand line facilities are april  and may  the million cad of demand line credit was established during fiscal  and is provided at the discretion of the lender 
during fiscal  we reduced the amount of credit available that could be used for either letters of credit or as a demand line from million usd to million usd 
this request was made by the lender due to our low utilization of this credit facility 
the reduction was effective july  and had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements or on our ability to fund our operations 
additionally  during fiscal  we increased our borrowing capacity for demand letters of credit from million usd to million usd

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year

if our fiscal average yield rate decreases by in fiscal  our income before taxes will decrease by approximately million

foreign exchange rate risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk primarily through our canadian operations where the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
we do not utilize hedging instruments to mitigate foreign currency exchange risks 
we believe our foreign currency translation risk is minimal as a hypothetical change in the canadian foreign exchange rate would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flows
