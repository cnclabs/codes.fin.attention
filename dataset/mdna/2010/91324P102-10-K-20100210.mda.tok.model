government regulation most of our health and well being services are regulated by federal and state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
federal and state governments continue to enact and consider 
table of contents various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system  including proposals to address the affordability and availability of health insurance and to reduce the number of uninsured individuals 
the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
new laws  regulations and rules  or changes in the interpretation of existing laws  regulations and rules  could negatively affect our business 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws  regulations and rules 
in the event we fail to comply with federal and state regulations  or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to health care reforms and frequent changes in federal and state regulations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal and state government regulations 
federal laws and regulation we are subject to various levels of federal regulation 
cms regulates ovations and americhoice medicare and medicaid businesses 
cms has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care given to medicare beneficiaries 
our health benefits reporting segment  through americhoice and ovations  also has medicaid and schip contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees  payment for those services  and other aspects of these programs 
there are many regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance 
when we contract with the federal government  we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of us government contracts 
in addition  the portion of ingenix s business that includes clinical research is subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration 
laws and regulations relating to consumer protection  anti fraud and abuse  anti kickbacks  anti money laundering  securities and antitrust also affect us 
hipaa  glba and other privacy and security regulation 
the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended hipaa  apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets  including self funded employee benefit plans 
hipaa requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers and certain eligible individuals 
it also requires guaranteed renewability for employers and individuals and limits exclusions based on preexisting conditions 
federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets  and for the privacy and security of protected health information 
the hipaa privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us 
federal privacy and security requirements change frequently because of legislation  regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation 
for example  the us congress enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra which significantly amends  and adds new  privacy and security provisions to hipaa and imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information 
aara includes new contracting requirements for hipaa business associate agreements  extends parts of hipaa privacy and security provisions to business associates  adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to the department of health and human services hhs and the federal trade commission ftc and  in some cases  to the local media  strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for hipaa violations and  in certain cases  imposes criminal penalties for individuals  including employees 
in the conduct of our business  we may act  depending on the circumstances  as either a covered entity or a business associate 
federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information 
the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws  including the gramm leach bliley act glba or state statutes implementing glba  which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party  and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with hipaa  glba and other privacy related regulations 

table of contents erisa 
the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer sponsored health benefit plans 
erisa is a set of laws and regulations subject to periodic interpretation by the us department of labor dol as well as the federal courts 
erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans  particularly those that maintain self funded plans 
regulations established by the dol provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by erisa 
additionally  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for health care plans 
fdic 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic has federal regulatory and supervisory authority over optumhealth bank and performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements 
in addition to such annual examinations  the fdic performs periodic examinations of the bank s compliance with applicable federal banking statutes  regulations and agency guidelines 
in the event of unfavorable examination results  the bank could be subject to increased operational expenses  governmental oversight and monetary penalties 
state laws and regulation health care regulation 
our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business 
all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate those products and operations 
these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements 
with the amendment of the annual financial reporting model regulation by the national association of insurance commissioners to adopt elements substantially similar to the sarbanes oxley act of  we expect that these states will continue to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of hmos and insurance companies 
health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations 
such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and general business operations 
some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets  as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates 
these laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 
in addition  some of our business and related activities may be subject to other health care related regulations and requirements  including ppo  managed care organization mco  utilization review ur or third party administrator related regulations and licensure requirements 
these regulations differ from state to state  but may contain network  contracting  product and rate  and financial and reporting requirements 
there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services  payment of claims  adequacy of health care professional networks  fraud prevention  protection of consumer health information  pricing and underwriting practices  and covered benefits and services 
state health care anti fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities  including kickbacks for referral of members  billing unnecessary medical services  and improper marketing 
our americhoice and ovations medicaid businesses are subject to regulation by state medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits by americhoice to its medicaid and schip beneficiaries and by ovations to its medicaid beneficiaries 
we also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of state government contracts 
pharmacy regulation 
prescription solutions mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the state in which they are located 
our mail order pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances 
in many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and 
table of contents regulations that require out of state mail order pharmacies to register with that state s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body 
these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located  although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 
our mail order pharmacies maintain certain medicare and state medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs 
participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations 
other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling  packaging  advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to our pbm businesses 
privacy and security laws 
states have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the glba 
like hipaa  glba allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
a number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices  for example  state laws that govern the use  disclosure and protection of social security numbers 
state and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft  with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information 
state consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information  including information related to consumers and care providers 
additionally  different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy related regulations 
udfi 
in addition  the utah state department of financial institutions udfi has state regulatory and supervisory authority over optumhealth bank and in conjunction with federal regulators performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements 
in addition to such annual examinations  the udfi in conjunction with federal regulators performs periodic examinations of the bank s compliance with applicable state banking statutes  regulations and agency guidelines 
in the event of unfavorable examination results  the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses  governmental oversight and monetary penalties 
commitments 
in connection with the pacificare health systems  inc pacificare and sierra health services  inc sierra acquisitions  which closed in december and february  respectively  certain of our subsidiaries entered into various commitments with state regulatory departments  principally in california and nevada 
many of the pacificare commitments in california expired on december  we believe that none of the remaining commitments in any of the affected states will materially affect our operations 
audits and investigations we have been and are currently involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments  state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  us congressional committees  the us department of justice  us attorneys  the sec  the internal revenue service  the us department of labor and other governmental authorities 
such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for details 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation  audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and retain our current business 
international regulation some of our business units  including ingenix s i business  have international operations 
these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions  including various tax  tariff and trade regulations  as well as employment  intellectual property  privacy  and investment rules and laws 

table of contents competition as a diversified health and well being services company  we operate in highly competitive markets 
our competitors include managed health care companies  insurance companies  hmos  tpas and business services outsourcing companies  health care professionals that have formed networks to directly contract with employers or with cms  specialty benefit providers  government entities  disease management companies  and various health information and consulting companies 
for our health benefits businesses  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  health net  inc  humana inc  kaiser permanente  wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas 
for our prescription solutions businesses  competitors include medco health solutions  inc  cvs caremark corporation and express scripts  inc our optumhealth and ingenix reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of other businesses 
new entrants into the markets in which we compete  as well as consolidation within these markets  also contribute to a competitive environment

if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share  including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected

table of contents proposed health care reforms could materially adversely affect our revenues  financial position and our results of operations 
both houses of congress have recently passed bills relating to health care reform  which have not yet been reconciled with each other and signed into law 
examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry  including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers  imposing new and potentially significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits  guaranteed coverage requirements  elimination of pre existing condition exclusions or annual lifetime maximum limits  restrictions on our ability to price products based on our underwriting standards  or restructuring the medicare or medicaid programs  including reducing payments to private plans offering medicare advantage over the intermediate term 
in addition  from time to time  congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation  which  if adopted  could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under erisa 
additionally  there is legislative interest in modifying erisa s preemptive effect on state laws 
if adopted  such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations 
a number of state legislatures  including california  colorado  new york  ohio and pennsylvania  have contemplated but have not enacted significant reform of their health insurance markets 
other states are expected to consider significant reform of their health insurance markets as well as more modest reforms aimed at expanding medicaid and or schip eligibility and new coverage options for those not eligible for government programs 
these proposals include provisions affecting both public programs and privately financed health insurance arrangements 
states also are considering proposals that would reform the underwriting and marketing practices of individual and group health insurance products by  for example  placing restrictions on rating and pricing and mandating minimum medical benefit cost ratios 
the enactment of health care reforms at the federal or state level may affect certain aspects of our business  including contracting with physicians  hospitals and or other health care professionals  medical  administrative  technology or other costs  physician reimbursement methods and payment rates  premium rates  coverage determinations  mandated benefits  minimum medical expenditures  claim payments and processing  drug utilization and patient safety efforts  collection  use  disclosure  maintenance and disposal of individually identifiable health information  personal health records  consumer driven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms  and government sponsored programs 
we cannot predict if any of these proposals will ultimately become law  or  if enacted  what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be 
any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years but  if enacted  could reduce our revenues  increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 
in addition  our results of operations  our financial position  including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes 
if we fail to effectively estimate  price for and manage our medical costs  the profitability of our risk based products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results 
under our risk based product arrangements  we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums 
premium revenues from risk based products comprise approximately of our total consolidated revenues 
we generally use approximately to of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers 
the profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to predict  price for  and effectively manage medical costs 
we manage medical costs through underwriting criteria  product design  negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs 
total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically fixed for a 
table of contents month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences 
our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year 
we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period  however  medical cost inflation  regulation and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids 
these factors may include increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
as a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
in addition  the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding 
these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment 
if these estimates prove too low  they will have a negative impact on our future results 
our business activities are highly regulated  new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our business is regulated at the federal  state  local and international levels 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
for example  in  cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of approximately for although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis  terminated benefit plans in certain counties  and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the medicare advantage program 
our results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such reductions 
the broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering regulations governing our business  as well as future laws and rules  could force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements  and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations  contract interpretation and other actions 
for example  in october congress enacted the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of mhpaea  which requires insurers to provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits under terms that are no more restrictive than those applied to medical and surgical benefits 
the mhpaea specifically directed the secretaries of labor  health and human services and the treasury to issue regulations to effectuate the legislation 
although regulations regarding how the mhpaea will be implemented were issued on february  in the form of an interim final rule  final regulations have not yet been published 
because of the broad range of treatment limitations to which parity is expected to apply under the regulations  the regulations will likely lead to an increase in the costs associated with both insured and self insured plans for behavioral health benefits and services and impact our market for carve out health benefit administration  which could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations 
we must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products  to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions  including integration of certain acquisitions 
delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
in august  we entered into a multi state national agreement with regulatory offices in states and the district of columbia relating to unitedhealthcare s fully insured commercial business administered on the 
table of contents organization s main processing platforms 
the agreement covers several key areas of review of our business operations  including claims payment accuracy and timeliness  appeals and grievances resolution timeliness  health care professional network service  utilization review  explanation of benefits accuracy  and oversight and due diligence of contracted entities and vendor performance 
the agreement addressed and resolved past regulatory matters related to the areas of review prior to august and establishes a transparent framework for evaluating and regulating performance through december the agreement is similar to a customer performance guarantee  whereby we self report quarterly and annually our current operational performance on a set of national performance standards agreed to by the participating states 
we must perform to the standards set forth in the agreement  or be subject to fines and penalties 
we are also involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these regulatory activities include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  us congressional committees  the us department of justice  us attorneys  the sec  the irs  the us department of labor and other governmental authorities 
for example  in  the california department of insurance examined our pacificare health insurance plan in california 
the examination findings related to claims processing accuracy and timeliness  accurate and timely interest payments  timely implementation of provider contracts  timely  accurate provider dispute resolution  and other related matters 
the matter is now the subject of an administrative proceeding before an administrative law judge 
in addition  the us department of labor is conducting an investigation of our administration of our employee benefit plans with respect to erisa compliance 
reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions  which can result in the assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business  loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  the health care industry is subject to negative publicity 
negative publicity  including negative publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations  may adversely affect our stock price  damage our reputation in various markets and result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices  which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services  requiring us to change our products and services  or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate 
for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our businesses  see item  business government regulation 
adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 
the current recessionary us economic environment may continue to impact demand for certain of our products and services 
for example  higher unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings have caused and could continue to lead to lower enrollment in our employer group plans  lower enrollment in our non employer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans 
adverse economic conditions have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary  employee funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 
in addition  the economic downturn could continue to negatively impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers 
all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers and therefore could adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs 

table of contents during a prolonged economic downturn  state and federal budgets could be adversely affected  resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs  including medicare  medicaid and schip 
a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and or received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs  such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges on select fee for service and capitated medical claims  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pbm industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products 
we provide pbm services through our prescription solutions and unitedhealthcare businesses 
each business is subject to federal and state anti kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers  customers and consumers 
in addition  federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices  including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies 
see item  business government regulation for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our pbm businesses 
our pbm businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa 
the dol  which is the agency that enforces erisa  could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pbm businesses even where our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations 
in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pbm businesses in connection with services for which our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations  we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions 
prescription solutions also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy  which subjects it to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations 
the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose prescription solutions to civil and criminal penalties 
further  prescription solutions is subject to the payment card industry data security standards  which is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management  policies  procedures  network architecture  software design and other critical protective measures to protect customer account data as mandated by the credit card brands 
the failure to adhere to such standards could expose prescription solutions to liability or impact their ability to process credit card transactions 
in addition  our pbm businesses would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacies  including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
disruptions at any of our mail order pharmacies due to failure of technology or any other failure or disruption to these systems or to the infrastructure due to fire  electrical outage  natural disaster  acts of terrorism or some other catastrophic event could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to customers 
if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share  including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate 
we compete with other companies on the basis of many factors  including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  
table of contents comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability and diversity of product offerings 
for our health benefits reporting segment  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  health net  inc  humana inc  kaiser permanente  wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare specialty services 
for our prescription solutions business  competitors include medco health solutions  inc  cvs caremark corporation and express scripts  inc our optumhealth and ingenix reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of other businesses 
we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial  so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily  and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
in particular markets  competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage 
greater market share  established reputation  superior supplier or health care professional arrangements  existing business relationships  and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate  both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals  physician groups and other care professionals in these industries 
consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers  to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers  or to maintain or advance profitability 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets  if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively  if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers  if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services  if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect  if membership or demand for other services declines  or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a payer in various government health care programs  we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding  enrollments  payment adjustments and audits that could adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
we participate in various federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  including as a payer in medicare advantage  medicare part d  various medicaid programs and schip  and receive revenues from these programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent changes  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs 
for example  cms recently implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of approximately for such changes have adversely affected our results of operations and willingness to participate in such programs in certain geographic areas in the past  and may do so in the future 
our participation in the medicare advantage  medicare part d  and various medicaid programs and schip occurs through bids that are submitted periodically 
revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms 
funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level  and general political issues and priorities 
a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs  including determining payments by considering the risk status of our medicare members as supported by provider medical record documentation 
federal regulators audit the supporting documents and can revise payments based on the audit findings 
cms announced in that it will perform audits of selected medicare health plans each year to 
table of contents validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by care providers 
these audits involve a review of medical records maintained by providers  including those in and out of network  and may result in prospective and retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans pursuant to cms medicare contracts 
certain of our plans have been selected for audit 
the first audits focused on medical records supporting risk adjustment data for that were used to determine payment amounts 
the office of inspector general for hhs is conducting an audit of our risk adjustment data for two plans 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the audits 
however  any material adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 
our ability to retain and acquire medicare  medicaid and schip enrollees is impacted by bids and plan designs submitted by our competitors and us 
under the medicaid managed care program  state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs 
if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts  we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans 
under the medicare part d program  to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members  our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold  which is set by the government after our bids are submitted 
if the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold  we risk losing the members who were auto assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto assigned to us 
for example  we lost approximately  of our auto enrolled low income subsidy members in because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government 
in general  our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  medical costs  and other factors 
in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect or our competitors bids and positioning are different than anticipated  either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or otherwise  our results of operations could be materially affected 
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers  our business could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for competitive prices and services 
our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services 
failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers  whether in network or out of network  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in any particular market  physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 
in addition  physician or practice management companies  which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage  may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
in addition  we have capitation arrangements with some physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
under the typical arrangement  the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member 
under some capitated arrangements  the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional 
to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement  we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement 
further  payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with 
table of contents whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members 
there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 
in addition  some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us 
in those cases  we do not have a pre established understanding with the provider about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members 
in some states  the amount of compensation due to these out of network providers is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances  it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms 
in some instances  providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 
for example  we are involved in litigation with out of network providers that is described in more detail in legal matters in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with out of network health care providers could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract  retain and provide support to a network of independent third party brokers  consultants and agents 
our products are sold in part through independent brokers  consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business 
we typically do not have long term contracts with our independent brokers  consultants and agents  who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend and or market health care products and services of our competitors 
as a result  we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance 
our sales would be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent brokers  consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support  training and education to them regarding our product portfolio  which is complex  or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 
in addition  there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care products and the payments they receive 
these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling these companies products 
for example  cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products 
these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and or changes to industry practice  which could adversely impact our ability to market our products 
if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and data security regulations  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality and security  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
the collection  maintenance  protection  use  transmission  disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the international  federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation 
various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal glba and in hipaa 
hipaa now requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements 
see item  business government regulation for a discussion of various federal and state privacy laws and regulations governing our businesses 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates and in certain cases assess our business associates security controls  we still have limited control over their actions and 
table of contents practices 
privacy and security requirements regarding personally identifiable information are also imposed on us through controls with our customers 
in addition  despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules  our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism or theft  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors or other similar events 
compliance with new privacy and security laws  requirements  and new regulations  such as arra  will result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes including further implementation of encryption and other data protection standards  new limitations or constraints on our business models  the development of new administrative processes  the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates  and increased enforcement actions and fines and penalties 
they also may impose further restrictions on our collection  disclosure and use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 
noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information  whether by us or by one of our business associates  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and results of operations  including mandatory disclosure to the media  significant increase in the number and cost of managing and remediating data security incidents  increased enforcement actions  material fines and penalties  compensatory  special  punitive  and statutory damages  litigation  consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices  adverse actions against our licenses to do business  and injunctive relief 
our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
under our agreements with aarp  we provide aarp branded medicare supplement insurance  hospital indemnity insurance and other products to aarp members and medicare part d prescription drug plans to aarp members and non members 
one of our agreements with aarp expands the relationship to include aarp branded medicare advantage plans for aarp members and non members 
our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers 
the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances  including  depending on the agreement  a material breach by either party  insolvency of either party  a material adverse change in the financial condition of the company  material changes in the medicare programs  material harm to aarp caused by the company  and by mutual agreement 
the success of our aarp arrangements depends  in part  on our ability to service aarp and its members  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  meet our corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  and diversity commitments  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
because of the nature of our business  we are routinely subject to various litigation actions  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
periodically  we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings 
these matters include  among others  claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees  customers  and contracted and non contracted physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  tort  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups 
we are largely self insured with regard to litigation risks 
although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self insurance  certain types of damages  such as punitive 
table of contents damages in some circumstances  are not covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters  however  it is possible that the level of actual losses will exceed the liabilities recorded 
a description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters 
therefore  these legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our investment portfolio may suffer losses  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could impair our profitability and capital position 
volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities  which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december  in addition  defaults by issuers  primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds  who fail to pay or perform on their obligations  could reduce our investment income and net realized investment gains or result in net realized investment losses as we may be required to write down the value of our investments  which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity 
we also invest a small proportion of our investments in equity investments  which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments 
general economic conditions  stock market conditions  and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 
there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  illiquidity or otherwise  could have a negative effect on our shareholders equity 
in addition  if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired  our results of operations  shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets were billion as of december   representing of our total assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
for example  the enactment of health care reforms may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in some of our businesses  as any passed legislation may significantly change the growth rate assumptions for some of our businesses 
any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in shareholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
large scale medical emergencies may result in significant medical costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
large scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death 
such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
for example  in the event of a natural disaster  bioterrorism attack  pandemic or other extreme events  we could face  among other things  significant medical costs and increased use of health care services 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations  changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions  we have been taking steps to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain  protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving systems and regulatory standards  and changing customer patterns 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have difficulty preventing  detecting and controlling fraud  have disputes with customers  physicians and other health care professionals  have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate  upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities  protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 
failure to consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management s time and energy  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products  our ability to market our knowledge and information related businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 
because we operate as a holding company  we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations 
these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states departments of insurance 
we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries 
the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated 
a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us 
in most states  we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
in addition  we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval 
an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures  business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock and our ability to repay our debt 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

table of contents any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our results of operations  business and prospects 
as part of our business strategy  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments  acquisitions  divestitures  strategic alliances  joint ventures  and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions 
if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives  we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally  we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
for acquisitions  success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations 
if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
downgrades in our credit ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims paying ability  financial strength  and credit ratings by recognized rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers 
our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future 
our ratings reflect each rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders 
downgrades in our credit ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations

executive overview general unitedhealth group is a diversified health and well being company  serving more than million americans 
our focus is on improving the overall health and well being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system 
we work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care 
we help people get the care they need at an affordable cost  support the physician patient relationship  and empower people with the information  guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions 
through our diversified family of businesses  we leverage core competencies in advanced technology based transactional capabilities  health care data  knowledge and information  and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better 
these core competencies are focused in two market areas  health benefits and health services 
health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our unitedhealthcare  ovations and americhoice businesses 
health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself  ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our optumhealth  ingenix and prescription solutions businesses 
in aggregate  these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets 
each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and well being access  affordability  quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market 
revenues our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed  typically for a one year period  and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs 
we also generate revenues from services performed for customers that self insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants 
for both risk based and fee based health care benefit arrangements  we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services  transaction processing  health care professional services  and access to contracted networks of physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals 
we also generate service revenues from ingenix health intelligence and contract research businesses 
product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our prescription solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of ingenix publishing and software products 
we derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities 
our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold  or other than temporarily impaired 
operating costs medical costs 
our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate  price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria  product design  negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs 
controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients consumers  health professionals  hospitals  pharmaceutical technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders 

table of contents medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
our medical care ratio  calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues  reflects the combination of pricing  benefit designs  consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts 
we seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business  however  changes in business mix  such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government sponsored public sector programs  will change the dynamics of our results 
operating costs 
operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits  agent and broker commissions  premium taxes and assessments  professional fees  advertising and occupancy costs 
cash flows we generate cash primarily from premiums  service revenues and investment income  as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments 
our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims  purchases of investments  common stock repurchases and payments on long term debt 
for more information on our cash flows  see liquidity below 
business trends our businesses participate in the us health economy  which comprises approximately of us gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years 
we expect overall spending on health care in the us to continue to rise in the future  based on inflation  demographic trends in the us population and national interest in health and well being 
the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors  including macro economic conditions and proposed health care reforms  which could also impact our results of operations 
adverse economic conditions 
the current us recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services 
for example  decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers  putting pressure on top line growth for our unitedhealthcare and optumhealth businesses 
this workplace attrition contributed more than half of the decrease in unitedhealthcare s commercial membership during  and this attrition trend is expected to continue at a generally elevated level until national employment stabilizes 
in contrast  our americhoice business is experiencing growth in its state medicaid offerings as employment rates fall 
if the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period  federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments 
our revenues are also impacted by us monetary and fiscal policy 
in response to recessionary conditions  the us federal reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to basis points 
changes in federal monetary policy have reduced the level of investment income received on our portfolio on a year over year basis 
in total  we believe that economic recessions will slow our revenue growth rate and could impact our operating profitability 
we also believe that government funding pressure  coupled with recessionary economic conditions  will impact the financial positions of hospitals  physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses 
for additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business  see item a  risk factors 

table of contents american recovery and reinvestment act 
our businesses may benefit from elements of the federal economic stimulus package that was enacted in response to the current recession 
these elements include expansion of funding to state programs  which could mitigate funding pressure for americhoice medicaid offerings at the state level  and funding for health care information technology  which could expand market opportunities for ingenix 
proposed health care reforms and reimbursement changes 
both houses of congress have recently passed bills relating to health care reform  which have not yet been reconciled with each other and signed into law 
examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry  including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers  imposing new and potentially significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits  guaranteed coverage requirements  elimination of pre existing condition exclusions or annual lifetime maximum limits  restrictions on our ability to price products based on our underwriting standards  or restructuring the medicare or medicaid programs  including reducing payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering medicare advantage 
we cannot predict if any of these proposals will ultimately become law  or  if enacted  what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be 
any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years  but  if enacted  could reduce our revenues  increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 
in addition  our operating results  our financial position  including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes 
the administration and various congressional leaders have advanced proposals to reduce payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering medicare advantage 
further  centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of approximately for although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis  terminated benefit plans in certain counties  and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the medicare advantage program 
our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by these reductions 
if industry wide medicare advantage membership declines  there is likely to be increased demand for medicare supplemental insurance and part d prescription drug coverage  and in both categories ovations is a market leader 
we operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses  this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors 
therefore  we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for our various products and services  depending on the scope  shape and timing of health care reforms 
it is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid to long term time horizon

these acquisitions were not material to our results of operations 
results of operations compared to results consolidated financial results revenues consolidated revenues for increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the health benefits reporting segment 
the increase in premium revenues was primarily due to strong organic growth in risk based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs  partially offset by a decline in the number of people served in the commercial market 
the effect of health benefits acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues during medical costs medical costs for increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets risk based businesses  elevated medical costs due to the hn influenza virus  unemployment related benefit continuation programs due to an increased level of national unemployment  medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services

operating costs operating costs for decreased due to certain expenses incurred in as discussed below and disciplined operating cost management  which were partially offset by increased costs due to acquired and organic business growth and from an increase in state insurance assessments levied against premiums  a portion of which was in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate 

table of contents operating costs for included million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs  million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out of network medical services  million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items  partially offset by a million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual medicare advantage business in nevada in may income tax rate our income tax rate for decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate  which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes 
reporting segments we have four reporting segments health benefits  which includes unitedhealthcare  ovations and americhoice  optumhealth  ingenix  and prescription solutions 
transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to health benefits customers by prescription solutions  certain product offerings sold to health benefits customers by optumhealth  and consulting and other services sold to health benefits by ingenix

earnings from operations and operating margins for decreased due to the decrease in commercial membership described above  start up costs for new large contracts and lower investment income  partially offset by earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and disciplined operating cost management 
ingenix improvements in ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business  new internal service offerings and the effect of acquisitions 
the decreases in operating margins for were primarily due to investments in services offerings  including outsourcing services for pharmaceutical customers and costs for international expansion  hospital revenue cycle management and data privacy and security

the decrease in investment and other income in was primarily due to lower investment yields primarily because of the decrease in interest rates on our cash equivalents  decreased average investment balances related to lower operating cash flows  decreased deposits held for certain government sponsored programs and increased other than temporary impairment charges related to the disruption in the financial markets 
medical costs medical costs for increased primarily due to medical cost inflation  acquisitions completed in and growth in ovations medicare advantage and medicare supplement products  partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through both unitedhealthcare risk based products and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
for and  medical costs included million and million  respectively  of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 
operating costs the operating cost ratio increased in primarily due to certain expenses as described in results of operations compared to results above  acquisitions completed in  costs for anticipated revenue growth that did not fully materialize and a change in business mix towards service revenues from fee based businesses 
operating costs for include million of expenses recorded in the first quarter of related to application of deferred compensation rules under section a of the internal revenue code section a to our historical stock option practices 
the million section a charge includes million of expenses for the payment of certain optionholders tax obligations for stock options exercised in and early and million of expenses for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments 
for an expanded discussion of our section a charges  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology development and enhancements  as well as additional depreciation and amortization related to business acquisitions 
income tax rate the decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings resulting in an increased proportion of tax free investment income to total earnings 

table of contents reporting segments health benefits the revenue growth in health benefits for was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets group  premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and the acquisitions of sierra  fiserv health  and unison  partially offset by an organic decline in individuals served through commercial risk based products and medicare part d products and a decrease in investment income 
unitedhealthcare revenues of billion in increased over the comparable period by billion  or 
the unitedhealthcare increase was primarily driven by the same factors as discussed for health benefits in ovations revenues of billion in increased over the comparable period by billion  or 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in individuals served with the standardized medicare supplement and medicare advantage products gained through both organic growth and the sierra acquisition and premium rate increases  which were partially offset by a net organic decrease of  stand alone medicare part d members primarily due to the reassignment by cms of certain dual eligible low income beneficiaries based on annual price bids 
americhoice generated revenues of billion in  an increase of billion  or  over the comparable period  primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by medicaid plans  premium rate increases and the acquisition of unison in the second quarter of the decrease in health benefits earnings from operations was primarily due to pressure on enrollment and gross margins in the unitedhealthcare risk based business and pressure on gross margins in medicare part d prescription drug plans  partially offset by acquisitions 
the unitedhealthcare medical care ratio increased to in from in this increase was primarily driven by the effects of a competitive pricing environment where price increases  net of customer benefit package changes  did not fully match the rise in medical costs  and an increased mix of national account pharmaceutical benefit business  which typically carries a higher medical care ratio 
health benefits operating margin was for the year ended december   a decrease from in primarily driven by the factors discussed above 
the number of individuals served with commercial products increased due to acquisitions  which included the addition of  fee based members from fiserv health and the addition of  risk based individuals gained through the sierra acquisition 
these additions were partially offset by a net decline in individuals served with commercial products of  or  from december   primarily due to a decline in individuals served with commercial risk based products and the impact of a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment 
the number of individuals served by medicare advantage products at december  increased through the addition of  seniors from our acquisition of sierra and organic growth of  seniors  partially offset by the divestiture of  individuals in nevada related to the sierra acquisition 
medicaid enrollment grew due to the addition of  and  individuals from our unison and sierra acquisitions  respectively  and strong organic growth of  individuals 
optumhealth increased revenues in optumhealth were driven by rate increases for medical cost inflation and an increased number of consumers served by this segment 
optumhealth provided services to approximately million consumers at december   an increase of approximately million individuals year over year 
earnings from operations and operating margin decreased due to the increased costs for risk based behavioral and specialty benefits businesses and the mix of continued growth in lower margin business 
ingenix the improvement in ingenix revenues was due to continued growth in its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions 
the decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to excess staffing costs during for certain research projects  which were cancelled  as well as lower demand for certain consulting services due to the current economic environment 

table of contents prescription solutions the decreased prescription solutions revenues were primarily due to the reduction in the number of individuals served related to the reassignment of dual eligible beneficiaries described above through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our ovations business  and a shift from name brand pharmaceuticals towards generic utilization  partially offset by revenues related to the fiserv health acquisition and growth in business with unaffiliated clients 
intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were billion and billion for and  respectively 
prescription solutions earnings from operations increased primarily due to the fiserv health acquisition  gains in mail service drug fulfillment  and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals 
liquidity  financial condition and capital resources liquidity introduction we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy 
we continually forecast and manage our cash  investments  working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility 
cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before depreciation  amortization and other non cash expenses 
as a result  any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
the diversity of our businesses  our geographic and customer diversity and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk based businesses  which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected medical costs  partially mitigates the risk of rising medical and operating costs 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term  investment grade  marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
we make these investments pursuant to our board of directors approved investment policy  which focuses on preservation of capital  credit quality  diversification  income and duration 
the policy also generally governs return objectives  regulatory limitations  tax implications and risk tolerances 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile 
most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
these standards  among other things  require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
except in the case of extraordinary dividends  these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
these dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval 
if the dividend  together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months  exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus  it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval 
in  based on the statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels  the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid was billion 
for the year ended december   our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of billion  including billion of extraordinary dividends 
for the year ended december   our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of billion  including billion of extraordinary dividends 
the increase in the proportion of extraordinary dividends to total dividends in primarily reflects the acceleration of dividend timing  as well as the size of specific dividends beyond ordinary levels 
given expected statutory capital levels  we anticipate lower overall regulated subsidiary dividends in 
table of contents our non regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use 
cash flows generated by these entities  combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long term debt  as well as the availability of our committed credit facility  further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility 
we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures  expanding our services through business acquisitions  repaying debt and or repurchasing shares of our common stock  depending on market conditions

we anticipate lower cash flows from operations in as compared to as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings  the timing of certain cms payments and the impact of a legislated change to the timing of payments for medicare part d claims 
cash flows used for investing activities decreased billion  or  primarily due to acquisitions completed in and decreases in the usage of cash in for purchases of investments  which more than offset the decreases in sales and maturities of investments 
cash flows used for financing activities increased billion due to the issuance of long term debt in and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our policy on offsetting cash balances 
these items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in and the proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts 

table of contents cash flows compared to cash flows cash flows from operating activities decreased billion  or  primarily due to the decrease in net earnings  which included payments for the settlement of two class action lawsuits described above 
cash flows used for investing activities increased million  or  primarily due to acquisitions completed in and increases in the usage of cash in for purchases of investments offset by the decreases in sales and maturities of investments

given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents  we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies  primarily used in valuing our level equity securities  may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments 
due to the subjective nature of these assumptions  the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date 
other sources of liquidity  primarily from operating cash flows  reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our fair value measurements 
our investment portfolio has a weighted average duration of years and a weighted average credit rating of aa as of december  included in the debt securities balance were billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties 
a number of different guarantors guarantee the securities  and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor neither indirect through the guarantees  nor direct through investment in the guarantor 
further  due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers  the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is aa as of december  capital resources and uses of liquidity in addition to cash flow from operations and significant cash and cash equivalent balances at our regulated and unregulated entities  our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows commercial paper 
we maintain a commercial paper program  which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities of up to days through third party broker dealers 
the commercial paper program is supported by the billion bank credit facility described below 
we did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of december  bank credit facility 
we have a five year revolving bank credit facility with banks  which matures in may this facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes 
we had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december  the interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread 
as of december   the interest rate on this facility  had it been drawn  would have ranged from to 
our bank credit facility contains various covenants  the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio below

we complied with the requirements of all debt covenants as of december  
table of contents shelf registration 
in february  we filed a universal s shelf registration statement with the sec registering an unspecified amount of debt securities 
credit ratings 
our credit ratings at december  were as follows moody s standard poor s fitch ratings outlook ratings outlook ratings outlook senior unsecured debt baa stable a negative a negative commercial paper p n a a n a f n a the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors  including our profitability  operating cash flows  debt levels  credit ratings  debt covenants and other contractual restrictions  regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions 
for example  a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 
we have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital 
debt tender 
in february  we completed cash tender offers for million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes 
we believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost 
we used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes 
share repurchases 
under our board of directors authorization  we maintain a common share repurchase program 
repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market 
in  we repurchased million shares at an average price of approximately per share and an aggregate cost of billion 
as of december   we had board of directors authorization to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
in february  the board renewed and increased our share repurchase program  and authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock

g includes obligations associated with contingent consideration related to a business acquisition  certain employee benefit programs  and charitable contributions related to the pacificare acquisition 
due to uncertainty regarding payment timing  obligations for employee benefit programs and the charitable contributions have been classified as thereafter 
we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources  however  we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations 
this includes internal development of new products  programs and technology applications  and may include acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any spe transactions 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
this update removes the criterion that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables and provides entities with a hierarchy of evidence that must be considered when allocating arrangement consideration 
the new guidance also requires entities to allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the deliverables relative selling price 
the provisions will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year and must be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of asu we have determined that all other recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  or do not apply to our operations 
critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
medical costs each reporting period  we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but 
table of contents not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied  centrally controlled and automated 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  seasonal variances in medical care consumption  health care professional contract rate changes  medical care utilization and other medical cost trends  membership volume and demographics  benefit plan changes  and business mix changes related to products  customers and geography 
depending on the health care professional and type of service  the typical billing lag for services can be up to days from the date of service 
substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
each period  we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as more complete claim information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate  we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate  we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development 
medical costs in  and  included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of million  million and million  respectively 
in developing our medical costs payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for example  we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation 
for months prior to the most recent three months  we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 
for the most recent three months  we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available  supplemented by a review of near term completion factors 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including  but not limited to  pharmacy utilization trends  inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control 
this approach is consistently applied from period to period 
completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factors increase decrease in factors increase decrease in medical costs payable in millions 
table of contents medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december  medical cost pmpm trend increase decrease in factors increase decrease in medical costs payable in millions the analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 
our estimate of medical costs payable represents management s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december   developed using consistently applied actuarial methods 
management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable  excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance  net earnings would increase or decrease by million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by per share 
the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation 
these include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals 
through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals  we emphasize preventive health care  appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards  education and closing gaps in care 
we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful 
however  other factors including competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers  major epidemics  and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation 
because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products  changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 
revenues revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums 
we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services  as recorded in our records 
employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears 
each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing 
we estimate and adjust the current period s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly 
our estimates are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information 
we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 

table of contents cms deploys a risk adjustment model  which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions 
under this risk adjustment methodology  cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient  hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings 
we and other health care providers collect  capture  and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill 
goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to an annual impairment test 
tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
to determine whether goodwill is impaired  we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step of the test  the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we would proceed to step two of the test 
in step two of the test  the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess  if any  of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date  goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date  goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance 
we calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows 
to determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors 
significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations  capital requirements and income taxes  long term growth rates for determining terminal value  and discount rates 
where available and appropriate  comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 
we completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of january  and determined that no impairment existed as of december  although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units  there is uncertainty inherent in those projections 
that uncertainty is increased by potential health care reforms as discussed in proposed health care reforms and reimbursement changes above  as any passed legislation may significantly change the forecasts and long term growth rate assumptions for some or all of our reporting units 
intangible assets 
finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance eg  customer lists and trademarks 
we do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible asset s or asset group s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value 
if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment would be recorded 
we calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets 
we consider many factors  including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows 
there were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year 

table of contents investments as of december   we had investments with a carrying value of billion  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in shareholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
we evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost 
for debt securities  if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security  we recognize the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis  the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and all other causes  which are recognized in other comprehensive income 
for equity securities  we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period 
if we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term  we recognize the impairment in net earnings 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector  and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  mortgage backed securities  and corporate debt obligations  substantially all of investment grade quality 
securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy 
income taxes our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
we have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
after application of the valuation allowances  we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we have established an estimated liability for federal  state and non us income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under us gaap 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 

table of contents the significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by on our earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by million 
contingent liabilities because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely involved in various disputes  legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters 
our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel  if appropriate  and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage  if any  for such matters 
it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 
legal matters a description of our legal proceedings is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein 
concentrations of credit risk investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk 
our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors 
this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base 
as of december   we had an aggregate billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery 
currently  the reinsurer is rated by am best as a 
as of december   there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt and b changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 
as of december   billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates  which may materially impact our investment income 
also  million of our debt as of december  was at interest rates that vary with market rates 
the fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates 
as of december   billion of our investments were fixed rate debt securities and billion of our debt was fixed rate term debt 
an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt 
conversely  a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt 
we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices  as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time in normal markets  either directly or through the use of interest rate swap
