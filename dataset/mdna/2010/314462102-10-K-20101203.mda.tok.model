distribution network the company s strategy is to develop a global distribution network for fc by entering into partnership arrangements with financially secure companies with appropriate marketing expertise 
this strategy has resulted in numerous in country distributions in the public health sector  particularly in africa  latin america and india 
the company has also entered into several partnership agreements for the commercialization of the fc female condoms in consumer sector markets around the world 
however  the company is dependent on country governments  global donors  as well as us municipal and state public health departments to continue aids hiv sti prevention programs that include fc as a component of such programs 
the company s commercial market penetration is dependent on its ability to identify appropriate business partners who wil l effectively market and distribute fc within its contractual territory 
failure by the company s partners to successfully market and distribute the fc female condom or failure of donors and or country governments to establish and sustain hiv aids prevention programs which include distribution of female condoms  the company s inability to secure additional agreements with global aids prevention organizations  or the company s inability to secure agreements in new markets  either in the public or private sectors  could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations
