we also provide tools  services and guidance that enable our representatives to provide these investment services directly to their clients

other allocation services are performed directly by fund companies 
critical accounting policies in general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies detailed in footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements contained herein  those dealing with valuation of securities and other assets  revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable involve a particularly high degree of judgment and complexity 
our accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material effect on the consolidated financial stateme nts 
therefore  understanding these policies is important to understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
off balance sheet risk we execute securities transactions on behalf of our customers 
if either the customer or counter party fails to perform  we  by agreement with our clearing broker  may be required to discharge the obligations of the non performing party 
in such circumstances  we may sustain a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract value of the transaction 
we seek to control off balance sheet risk by monitoring the market value of securities held or given as collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
pursuant to such guidelines  our clearing firm requires that we reduce positions when necessary 
we also complete credit evaluations where there is thought to be credit risk 
reserves we record reserves related to legal proceedings in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
many factors are considered including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or representatives  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge or credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect an d the actual costs upon disposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserved amount 
risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
risk management is critical to our financial strength and profitability and requires robust auditing  constant communications  sound judgment and knowledge of financial regulations  trends and the economy as a whole 
we take a holistic approach to governance  risk management and compliance 
management and staff  at all levels  take an active role in the risk management process 
the principal risks involved in our business activities include market  operational  regulatory and legal risks 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  market risk market risk is the risk attributable to common macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product  employment  inflation  interest rates  budget deficits and consumer sentiment 
consumer and producer sentiment is critical to our business 
the level of consumer confidence determines their willingness to spend  especially in the financial markets 
it is the willingness to spend in the financial markets that is key to our business 
a shift in spending in this area  often caused by market volatility  could negatively impact us 
in addition  declines in market values negatively impact investment advisory revenues that are based upon the value of assets under management 
we constantly monitor these economic trends in order to enhance and broaden our product line to mitigate potential negative impact of such trends 
operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution of transactions  deficiencies in our technology or financial or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes 
managing these risks is critical  especially in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volume 
failure to manage these risks could result in material financial loss to the company 
to mitigate these risks  the company has developed policies and procedures designed to identify and manage operational risk 
these policies and procedures are reviewed and updated on a continuing basis by a broad based risk committee that meets weekly to ensure that risk is minimized 
regulatory and legal risk regulatory and legal risk includes non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk of a large number of customer claims that could result in adverse judgments against us 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which it operates  and we maintain a panoply of procedures to address issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  the granting of credit  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
however  compliance procedures  no matter how stringent and comprehensive  can only limit  but not completely prevent  the institution of regulatory and legal proceedings  the outcomes and consequences of which typically cannot be reasonably foreseen or quantified 
in the normal course of business  we continue to be the subject of numerous civil actions and arbitrations arising out of customer complaints relating to our alleged activities as a broker dealer or investment advisor  as an employer or as a result of other business activities 
in line with general industry experience  the volume of such complaints has generally trended upward over time  and particularly as a consequence of market losses incurred by customers during the most recent financial downturn 
however  we have recently experienced a marked redution in our legal charges 
effects of inflation our assets primarily are liquid in nature and not significantly affected by inflation 
management believes that the replacement cost of property and equipment will not materially affect operating results 
however  the rate of inflation can affect our expenses  including  without limitation  employee compensation and benefits  communications and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided 
key indicators of financial performance investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  we periodically review and analyze our financial performance across a number of measurable factors considered to be particularly useful in understanding and managing our business 
key metrics in this process include adjusted ebitda as defined below  productivity and practice diversification of representatives  top line commission and advisory services revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  legal costs  taxes and earnings per share 
comparison of fiscal years ended march  and the following discussion provides an assessment of our results of operations  capital resources and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations percent of revenue year ended march  year ended march  percent change vs 
revenues commission   advisory fees   other fee income   marketing revenue   other income   total revenue   commissions and advisory fees expense   gross profit   operating expenses advertisement and marketing   communications   total selling expenses   compensation and benefits   regulatory  legal and professional   occupancy   other administrative expenses   interest expense   total administrative expenses   total operating expenses   operating income loss   provision benefit for income taxes   net income loss   adjusted ebitda   income tax benefit   interest expense   income tax expense  depreciation   non cash compensation   non recurring professional fees to evaluate strategic business opportunities  net income loss   adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as adjusted by eliminating other non cash expense  gains or losses on sales of assets  and various non recurring items adjusted ebitda  is a key metric we use in evaluating our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we believe are not part of our core operations  are non recurring items of revenue or expense  or do not involve a cash outlay  such as stock related compensation 
we consider adjusted ebitda important in monitoring and evaluating our financial performance on a consistent basis across various periods 
we also use adjusted ebitda as a primary measure  among others  to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions 
adjusted ebitda is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by regulation g investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  promulgated by the sec under the securities act 
adjusted ebitda should be considered in conjunction with  rather than as a substitute for  important gaap financial measures including pre tax income  net income and cash flows from operating activities 
items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant and necessary components to the operations of our business  therefore  adjusted ebitda should only be used as a supplemental measure of our operating performance 
productivity and practice diversification of representatives management believes that improving the overall quality of our independent representatives is a key to achieving growth in revenues and net income 
we believe that upgrading the business practices of our representatives not only generates more revenue  but assists in limiting the cost of overhead functions and representative noncompliance 
we strive to continually improve the overall quality of our force of representatives by assisting representatives to improve their skills and practices  recruiting established  high quality representatives  and terminating low quality representatives 
productivity a key metric that we use to assess the average quality of our producing non staff representatives is per capita rep generated revenue based on a rolling month period 
data for the month periods ended march  and are presented below year ended increase march  march  incease decrease decrease rep generated revenue commission    advisory    other fee income    number of representatives average revenue per representative    we believe that the increase in per capita rep generated revenue  while indicative of overall market improvement  also reflects recruitment of quality representatives who offer superior investment products and services to their clients  especially in times of volatile markets 
among the steps that were taken during the most recent fiscal year to attract and retain higher quality representatives was increasing total payouts percentages for high end producers 
practice diversification our revenues and earnings are substantially affected by general conditions in financial markets 
further  past performance is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
in our securities brokerage business  the amount of our revenues depends on levels of market activity requiring the services we provide 
we encourage diversification in the investments products and services recommended or selected by our independent representatives for their clients through recruitment  education and training 
this enables our representatives to more fully serve the investment and security needs of their clients  particularly in volatile markets 
we believe that representatives who offer sophisticated investment products and services to their clients will generate relatively high margin transaction and fee based business and recurring revenues that will help us weather volatile and down markets 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  revenues revenues decreased by million  or  to million  led by a million or decline in commissions offset by a million or increase in advisory services revenue 
revenues from advisory services increased primarily as a result of asset values in managed portfolios returning to previous balances before the significant market disruption beginning in september commissions the decline in commissionable revenues was mostly attributable to a drop off in direct business investments including variable annuities  mutual funds and direct participation programs 
the decline was most notable in direct participation programs  including a decrease in sales of real estate investment trust programs reits that correlated with the real estate market crisis 
on the other hand  brokerage revenue increased considerably as investors returned to a market that was rebounding from low levels established in prior periods

advisory responding to industry trends and increasing client demand  we have endeavored to assist our representatives in transitioning more of their business to advisory services 
we do not dictate the general nature or extent of advisory services our representatives provide for their clients 
however  we continue to make concerted efforts to attract our representatives to our expanded line of proprietary advisory services programs through education  seminars  tradeshows and direct telemarketing 
assisted by pershing s on line platform  a map remains popular because of the opportunities it provides representatives to deliver superior asset management services and overall investment performance at a lower cost 
resulting transactional cost savings have been shared with our representatives clients in the form of lower fees 
revenues from this program increased by million or due to an increase in assets under management driven principally by market wide increases in asset values 
revenue from the ica directed f map program grew by or million  reflecting improvement in portfolio performance and asset contributions 
utilizing an experienced investment policy committee  this ica directed program provides a mutual fund and exchange traded funds etf s managed portfolio to our representatives 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  other fee income the growth in other fee income reflects increases in annual representative renewal fees instituted to fund rising licensing and other regulatory costs 
marketing revenue net marketing revenues increased by principally due to a reduction in net costs in sponsoring our conventions that was offset by a decline in product sales from companies participating in our partnership programs 
other income other income  consisting primarily of interest and dividends and gains losses on investments  decreased by 
the decrease is attributable to a reduction in interest income earned on declining trade and related cash balances impacted by reductions in federal funds rates

overall our gross margin decreased by million  or  to million led by a million  or  decline in gross margin derived from our direct check and application programs as we welcomed more representatives onto our brokerage platform 
also contributing to this decrease was a million or decrease in profit margin from brokerage primarily as a result of the decrease in income derived from money market balances 
commissions profit margin from commissions decreased by million  or mainly as a result of a million decrease in sales of direct participation programs  primarily reits  which generated the bulk of the million decrease 
profit margin from brokerage declined principally as a result of a reduction in recurring revenues due to a reduction in the target rate on federal funds offset by a decrease in clearing firm charges in transferring accounts 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  advisory services profit margins from advisory services increased by or million primarily as a result of decreased transaction costs in managing the revised a map nt program  now referred to as the a map at program 
in addition  the company experienced an increase in margin from the f map program as a result of increased asset values due to improvement in performance and new asset contributions 
finally  the increase in advisory services margins also reflected contributions from other services including financial planning and the newly created fund select program 
commission and advisory fees expenses profit margins are inversely aligned with payout of commission and advisory fees to our representatives as a percentage of revenue generated by them 
we strive to recruit quality independent representatives who generate recurring revenues that do not flow through the commission and advisory expense payout grid  primarily as brokerage commissions and advisory fees 
management monitors the amount of revenue an independent representative brings in compared to his or her payout on that revenue 
commission and advisory fee expenses during the current period were million as compared to million for the prior period 
as a percentage of revenue generated by representatives defined as commissions  advisory fees and other fees  commission and advisory expenses increased from in the prior period to in the current period due primarily to structural increases in the percentage of commissionable revenue paid to high producing representatives 
these expenses include commissions to representatives  clearing and execution costs and other direct costs that are necessary to produce revenue 
management continuously monitors these costs as they have a substantial effect on our profit margin 
operating expenses operating expenses  which decreased by or by million  are discussed in detail below 
compensation and benefits the largest component of operating expense  compensation and benefits  decreased by million or 
the drop is attributed principally to reduced health care plan costs  a suspended k plan match  and reduced stock compensation coupled with minimal hiring 
finally  during the prior period there was a resignation by one of our officers whom we did not replace 
in january  pay cuts in effect since february for the salaried staff employees were restored 
in april  pay cuts in place as of january were restored to members of the senior management team 
regulatory  legal and professional regulatory  legal and professional expenses declined by million  or  reflecting significant reductions in both litigation and settlement costs 
in the prior period  the company had incurred legal defense and settlement costs stemming from two major lawsuits 
also in the prior period  the company incurred legal fees for strategic corporate matters whereas in the current period there were no legal fees of that nature 
we will continue to incur legal fees and settlement costs as we operate in a litigious  regulated industry 
in addition  from time to time regulatory agencies and self regulatory organizations institute investigations into industry or company practices  which can also result in the imposition of sanctions 
we invest significant resources to contain litigation and regulatory exposure by promoting sound operational procedures 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  advertising advertising  including related marketing and branding efforts  along with meals and entertainment decreased by million  or 
due primarily to restricting print advertisements to fewer publications  a sharp reduction in travel and entertainment expenses  and a decrease in direct marketing expenses for recruitment purposes 
communications communications expenses  which include such items as telephone and connectivity costs and investor relations  were consistent with levels during the prior year  however  we are looking to further expand  update and improve our website as an effective media for communicating to our independent representatives  customers and others 
communications expense decreased by  or million due primarily to a reduction in company sponsored trips 
we sponsored a reward trip during august  whereas we combined that event with sponsored events in the current period 
additionally  the company reduced its telephone expenses  and the increased use of electronic rather than print for direct marketing efforts 
in addition there were decreases in website connectivity costs following the closing of our investment centers 
occupancy occupancy expenses  which include depreciation  decreased by or million due to the closing of investment centers as well as downsizing of home office space upon the expiration of a lease 
also depreciation decreased as a result of lower capital expenditures combined with existing assets fully depreciating 
other administrative other administrative expenses  which include various insurance  loan reserves  postage  office and computer related expenses  decreased by million or primarily due to a reduction in regulatory fines and penalties offset by an increase in insurances for our fidelity bond and our directors and officers liability 
we also had increased directors fees as a result of board members sitting in on a special committee evaluating strategic corporate matters 
interest expense interest expense decreased by reflecting lower margin balances in our firm accounts and reduced rate charges on e o insurance financing 
operating and net income the company reported a significant turnaround in operating income  million as compared to a million operating loss for the prior period 
our net income totaled million  or per basic and diluted net income per share  compared to net loss of million  or basic and diluted net loss per share  for the prior period 
we have realized growth in every category of revenue  except commissions  during each of the last fiscal four quarters compared to the immediately preceding year  as declines in the overall economy have tapered 
management attributes the stabilization in operating income primarily to reduced operating costs  recent growth in the recruitment of productive representatives  enhanced operating efficiency  and growth of our advisory segment s asset values 
the company expects to continue to operate in a more efficient environment  however  the company s main focus will be to grow revenues strategically by recruiting brokerage based representatives and high end asset advisors as the company moves forward 
the company  to remain competitive  will continue to seek to improve the quality of customer service to its representatives including technology enhancement to ensure a superior experience 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  in the current year  the company has begun to rebound with positive operating income as we see improvements in the financial and economic circumstances  and we are cautiously optimistic that these conditions present an opportunity to optimize our human capital and maximize operational efficiency 
however  we cannot forecast the severity or permanence of the impact on our financial position that may result from a continuation and worsening of disruption in financial markets 
much of such future impact is inherently beyond our ability to forecast or control 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity remains cash flows from operations  primarily from our broker dealer and investment advisory business 
we take a proactive approach to minimizing the occurrence and impact of events that may lead to unpredictable cash outflows  including major legal proceedings  trade errors  and fines and other sanctions imposed by regulatory bodies such as finra  the sec and state securities regulators 
a key to this approach is ensuring that industry standard controls over our operations and those of our representatives are consistently maintained 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents totaled million as compared to million as of march  working capital as of march  was million as compared to million as of march  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of march  as compared to to as of march  operations provided million in cash for the year ended march  as compared to million of cash provided for the year ended march  in comparing cash flow from operating activities for fiscal year ended march  to fiscal year ended march   cash flows decreased by million largely because we had paid major legal settlements that were included in accounts payable at march  offset by the insurance recovery from our fidelity bond 
cash flows from investing activities during the current period primarily consisted of million in cash for acquisition of equipment along with million of salaries devoted to capitalized internal software in the development of our new proprietary transparency system 
also during the current period cash used in financing activities consisted mostly of million in principal payments on a short term note to finance insurance premiums 
cash flows from investing activities for the prior year primarily consisted of million in cash provided from treasury notes and certificates of deposit maturing offset by million of cash used to purchase additional equipment 
cash used in the prior year for financing activities consisted mostly of million in principal payments on a short term note obligation to finance insurance premiums along with proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
regulatory net capital cash disbursements can have a material impact on our brokerage firm s regulatory net capital 
the sec uniform net capital rule rule c requires that icc  our broker dealer subsidiary  maintain net capital of  and a ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital a net capital ratio not to exceed to under the rule  indebtedness generally includes all money owed by icc  and net capital includes icc cash and assets that are easily converted into cash 
sec rules also prohibit equity capital which  under the net capital rule  includes subordinated loans from being withdrawn  cash dividends from being paid and other specified actions of similar effect from being taken  if  among other specified contingencies  icc s net capital ratio would exceed to or if icc would have less than of its minimum required net capital 
as of march   icc had net capital of million ie  an excess of million and a to net capital ratio as compared to net capital of approximately million ie  an excess of investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  million and a to net capital ratio as of march  the increase in net capital was the primary result of the increase in stockholder s equity generated by income from operations of the broker dealer 
positive cash flow and maintenance of satisfactory net capital depends primarily upon generation of operating income 
the company experienced a considerable loss in the prior period principally as a result of legal settlement and defense costs and turmoil in financial markets
