net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the net interest margin for was  up basis points from these increases were the result of the company s growth in core deposits which improved our funding mix combined with active management of deposit and wholesale pricing 
in comparison to  the yield on interest bearing liabilities declined by  while the yield on interest earning assets only declined by due to ongoing loan pricing management 
also  contributing to the increase in net interest income was an increase in our mortgage backed securities mbs portfolio during  due to purchases made throughout the year to take advantage of market opportunity and optimize our capital position 
in addition  the yield on our loan portfolio remained relatively stable 
net interest income increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the net interest margin for was  up from these increases were the result of a liability sensitive balance sheet combined with active management of loan and deposit pricing

provision for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based on management s assessment of the estimable and probable losses in the loan portfolio  pursuant to accounting literature  which is discussed further in the nonperforming assets section of this management s discussion and analysis 
management s evaluation is based upon a review of the portfolio and requires significant judgment 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for loan losses of million compared to million in and million in the million was the reslt of credit risk migration and collateral depreciation in our commercial loan portfolio due to economic conditions mostly in our construction and land development cld portfolio  net charge offs  continued growth of our loan portfolio and restructured consumer loans 
the increase in the provision for loan loss reflects the protracted economic recession and its adverse effects on our customers ability to pay their obligations 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased million to million in  or  from million in a significant amount of this increase was due to securities gains  which increased million during this security gain included million of incremental mark to market adjustments on the bbb mortgage backed security mbs  as we recognized positive adjustments of million during compared with negative adjustments of million in the securities gains increase also included million in gains from the sale of securities during partially offsetting these increases was the absence of any gains on the sale of visa  inc shares in during we recognized million in gains on sale of visa  inc shares related to the completion of their initial public offer 
in addition to securities gains  mortgage banking activities increased million due to increased mortgage loan originations and sales  including a million bulk loan sale completed during also during  loan fee income increased million as a result of increased fees from st reverse  our majority owned national reverse mortgage subsidiary 
during the second quarter of the decision was made to conduct an orderly wind down of st reverse which was completed in the fourth quarter of these noninterest income increases were partially offset by a reduction in boli income of  due to lower yields in underlying investments funding this program and a  decrease in credit debit card and atm income which was the result of reduced prime based atm bailment fees from cash connect resulting from the lower interest rate environment 
although noninterest income was negatively impacted by lower bailment fees  the net interest margin benefited due to lower funding costs for these borrowings 
noninterest income decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the majority of the decrease was due to a million decrease in credit card debit card and atm income due to reduced prime based atm bailment fees 
in addition  had included a million non recurring gain related to the sale of our former headquarters building and an  gain from the sale of our credit card portfolio 
also during  income from boli decreased  from the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in loan fee income of million 
the majority of the increase in loan fee income was due to  in fees from st reverse 
deposit service charges also increased million  as a result of overall growth in deposits 
in we also recorded a million gain on the sale of shares related to the completion of visa s initial public offering  and a million charge related to the mark to market adjustment on the bbb rated mbs 
noninterest expenses 
noninterest expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in a large portion of the increase is attributable to million of non routine items recorded during  including a million charge related to the wind down of st reverse  million for the fdic special assessment  million of expense resulting from a wire fraud and million of due diligence expenses on an acquisition prospect in which discussions have terminated 
for additional information on any of these non routine items see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the non routine items  the remaining increase was mainly due to an additional million of fdic insurance premium expense during also during  write downs of assets acquired through foreclosure reo and other credit related costs increased million  related to additional deterioration in housing prices and appraisal values 
further  during professional fees increased million mainly due to increased credit related costs 
in addition  the increase in professional fees included a million accrual of consulting expenses related the company s efficiency effort creative opportunities for revenues and expenses core program 
this expense accrual is for the portion of the consultant s work that is substantially performed  while the consultant s payments  expense savings and revenue enhancements will largely be realized in future periods 
lastly  salaries  benefits and other compensation as well as occupancy and equipment expenses increased million due to the continued growth of our banking franchise during this growth included the full year impact of seven branch openings and renovations during including four branches from sun national bank and an additional two new branches and two branch relocations during noninterest expenses increased million to million in  or  from million in excluding million of expenses related to st reverse  acquired in the second quarter of  expenses increased million or over as a result of continued growth efforts salaries  benefits  and other compensation increased million while other operating expenses increased million 
included in other operating expenses was a  increase in fdic charges due to increased assessment rates 
during the investment in the wsfs franchise included the opening of one branch in selbyville  delaware  the relocation of another branch in smyrna  delaware  and the previously mentioned acquisition of branches in further  during professional fees increased million as a result of legal fees reflecting increased costs relating to problem credits 
income taxes 
we recorded a million tax benefit for the year ended december  compared to tax expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax benefit is a result of our pre tax operating loss  combined with tax free income and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits during the year 
volatility in effective tax rates is directly impacted by the level of pretax income or loss combined with the amount of tax free income as well as the effects of unrecognized tax benefits 
the provision for income taxes includes federal  state and local income taxes that are currently payable or deferred because of temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax reporting bases of the assets and liabilities 
we analyze our projection of taxable income and make adjustments to our provision for income taxes accordingly 
for additional information regarding our tax provision and net operating loss carryforwards  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition total assets increased million  or  during to billion 
this increase was due to growth in mortgage backed securities  which grew million  or and cash in non owned atms which increased million  or during additionally  net loans increased by million  or during the year 
funding this growth was an increase in customer deposits of million  or and an increase in stockholders equity of million  or 
partially offsetting these funding increases was a decrease in wholesale funding  including million  or decrease in federal home loan bank advances 
cash in non owned atms 
during  cash in non owned atms managed by cash connect  our atm unit  increased million  or 
during the year one of our cash management partners decided to no longer invest their cash in bailments and as a result we replaced million of external funding with our own cash 
in addition  the number of atms serviced by cash connect increased from  at december  to  at december  of these  atms were wsfs owned and operated during mortgage backed securities 
investments in mortgage backed securities increased million during to million 
included in the increase was the purchase of short duration  recently aaa rated  super senior tranches of securities during fourth quarter 
there were proceeds from sales of million in mortgage backed securities during for a gain of million 
the weighted average duration of the mortgage backed securities portfolio was years at december  investment securities 
our investment securities are comprised mostly of federal agency debt securities with a maturity of four years or less 
we own no collateralized debt obligations  bank trust preferred  agency preferred securities or equity securities in other fdic insured banks or thrifts 
loans  net 
net loans increased million  or  during this included increases of million  or  in commercial and commercial real estate loans  and million  or  in consumer loans 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in residential mortgage loans mainly due to our strategy to originate then sell these loans in the secondary market to generate fee income 
first mortgage originations for the year totaled million  the majority of which were subsequently sold 
customer deposits 
customer deposits increased million  or  during to billion 
during we acquired six delaware branches from sun national bank  including million in customer deposit accounts and paid a premium on the balances 
for additional information regarding this transaction  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
core deposit relationships demand deposits  money market and savings accounts increased million  or  during in addition  customer time deposits cds increased million  or  in the table below depicts the changes in customer deposits over the last three years year ended december  in millions beginning balance interest credited deposit inflows  net ending balance borrowings and brokered certificates of deposit 
borrowings and brokered certificates of deposit decreased by million  or  during this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in fhlb advances of million  or  as customer deposits replaced these borrowings and we improved our funding mix 
partially offsetting this decrease was a million  or  increase in brokered deposits 
also during we issued million of debt under the fdic s temporary liquidity program 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase was mainly due to the sale of senior preferred stock to the us department of the treasury under its capital purchase program cpp totaling million and the sale of million of common stock to peninsula investment partners  l 
p peninsula 
the increase also included million in comprehensive income mainly due to an increase in the fair value of securities available for sale 
partially offsetting these increases was the payment of cash dividends both preferred and common stock totaling million during during we did not repurchase any shares of common stock 
asset liability management our primary asset liability management goal is to maximize long term net interest income opportunities within the constraints of managing interest rate risk  while ensuring adequate liquidity and funding and maintaining a strong capital base 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
we regularly review our interest rate sensitivity  and use a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management and the board of directors 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of our primary strategies to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
the repricing and maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are set forth in the following table less than one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets real estate loans commercial loans consumer loans mortgage backed securities loans held for sale investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits retail time deposits jumbo certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit fhlb advances trust preferred borrowings other borrowed funds deficiency excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate liabilities interest rate sensitive gap one year interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities one year interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets includes commercial mortgage  construction  and residential mortgage loans 
loan balances exclude nonaccruing loans  deferred fees and costs 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income while a negative gap would augment net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities which contractually reprice within the rate period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as we adjust our interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
to provide a more accurate position of our one year gap  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of our deposit accounts  that of money market and of interest bearing demand deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes and that of savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five year category 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are generally subject to local market conditions and management s discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
during the first quarter of we executed million of intermediate term fhlb advances in order to reduce the sensitivity of our net interest income to increases in market interest rates 
reverse mortgages we hold an investment in reverse mortgages of  at december  representing a participation in reverse mortgages with a third party 
eighteen loans remain in this portfolio 
the loans were originated in the early s 
these reverse mortgage loans are contracts that require the lender to make monthly advances throughout the borrower s life or until the borrower relocates  prepays or the home is sold  at which time the loan becomes due and payable 
reverse mortgages are nonrecourse obligations  which means that the loan repayments are generally limited to the net sale proceeds of the borrower s residence 
we account for our investment in reverse mortgages by estimating the value of the future cash flows on the reverse mortgages at a rate deemed appropriate for these mortgages  based on the market rate for similar collateral 
actual cash flows from the maturity of these mortgage loans can result in significant volatility in the recorded value of reverse mortgage assets 
as a result  income varies significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
for the year ended december   we lost  in interest income on reverse mortgages 
for the year ended december   we lost million in interest income on reverse mortgages as compared to posting income of million in the losses in and primarily resulted from the decrease in the values of the properties securing the mortgages  based on annual re evaluations and consistent with the decrease in home values over the past two years 
the projected cash flows depend on assumptions about life expectancy of the mortgagee and the future changes in collateral values 
projecting the changes in collateral values is the most significant factor impacting the volatility of reverse mortgage values 
our current assumptions include a short term annual appreciation rate of in the first year  and a long term annual appreciation rate of in future years 
if the long term appreciation rate was increased to  the resulting impact on income would have been  conversely  if the long term appreciation rate was decreased to  the resulting impact on income would have been 
if housing values do not change annual appreciation for all future years the resulting impact on income would be 
we also hold million fair value of bbb rated mortgage backed securities classified as trading and have options to acquire up to of class o certificates issued in connection with securities consisting of a portfolio of reverse mortgages we previously owned 
the class o certificates are currently recorded on our financial statements at a zero value 
at the time of the securitization  the third party securitizer lehman brothers holding  inc lehman brothers retained of the class o certificates from the securitization 
these class o certificates have no priority over other classes of certificates under the trust and no distributions will be made on the class o certificates until  among other conditions  the principal amount of each other class of notes has been reduced to zero 
the underlying assets  the reverse mortgages  are very long term assets 
therefore  any cash flow that might inure to the holder of the class o certificates is not expected to occur until a number of years in the future 
additionally  we can exercise our option on of the class o certificates in up to five separate increments for an aggregate purchase price of million any time between january  and the termination of the securitization trust 
the option to purchase the class o certificates does not meet the definition of a derivative under asu  derivatives and hedging sfas no 
 disclosure about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
and is carried in our financial statements at cost 
during the third quarter of lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy 
during we filed a proof of claim against lehman brothers regarding the option on the class o certificate 
also during we notified lehman brothers that we were exercising our option on these securities 
the status of this exercise is pending 
during  we formed a new reverse mortgage initiative  originating reverse mortgages primarily in our retail banking footprint 
in we ranked as the reverse mortgage lender in delaware and seventy seventh nationwide 
while our activity during the past two years has been limited to acting as a correspondent for these loans  it is our intention to originate and underwrite our own reverse mortgages in the future 
we expect to sell most of these loans and do not intend to hold them in our portfolio 
these reverse mortgages are government approved and insured 
during  we acquired a majority interest in st reverse financial services  llc st reverse  which specializes in originating and subsequently selling reverse mortgage loans nationwide 
these reverse mortgages are government approved and insured 
during the latter part of  we decided to conduct an orderly wind down of st reverse operations discussed further in note of the financial statements 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure and troubled debt restructures  can negatively affect our results of operations 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal and interest 
past due loans are defined as loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans commercial consumer commercial mortgages residential mortgages construction total nonaccruing loans assets acquired through foreclosure restructured loans total nonperforming assets past due loans residential mortgages commercial and commercial mortgages consumer total past due loans ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of loan loss allowance to nonaccruing loans total loans exclude loans held for sale 
the applicable allowance represents general valuation allowances only 
total non performing assets increased million during as a result  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased from at december  to at december  nonperforming assets increased in all portfolios except commercial mortgages 
nonaccruing construction loans increased million during with a bulk of the dollar increase related to six borrowing relationships that were placed on nonaccrual status during the year 
nonaccruing commercial loans increased by million 
except for the addition of two larger relationships million in balances  the increase was mostly due to the migration of small business loans during assets acquired through foreclosure increased million predominantly due to the foreclosure of two residential construction and land development loans during the year 
restructured loans increased by million 
all of the restructured loans continue to be residential mortgage and consumer loans 
concessions on these loans consisted mainly of forbearance agreements  reduction in interest rate or extensions of maturity 
all loans classified above as restructured are accruing and there were only million of restructured loans included in nonaccruing loan balances 
nonaccruing restructured loans remain in nonaccrual status until there has been sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable period  generally six months 
the following table provides an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three years year ended december  in thousands beginning balance additions collections transfers to accrual charge offs write downs ending balance as of december   we had million of loans  which although performing at that date  require increased supervision and review  and may  depending on the economic environment and other factors  become nonperforming assets in future periods 
the amount of such loans at december  was million 
the majority of the loans are secured by commercial real estate  with lesser amounts being secured by residential real estate  inventory and receivables 
at december   we did not have a material amount of loans not classified as non accrual  days past due or restructured but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused us to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and may result in disclosure as non accrual  days past due or restructured 
allowance for loan losses 
we maintain allowances for credit losses and charge losses to these allowances when such losses are realized 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment reflecting management s best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios 
we established our loan loss allowance in accordance with guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab 
its methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements which include specific allowances for identified problem loans  formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans  and allowances for pooled homogenous loans 
specific reserves are established for certain loans in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a specific credit that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred 
the formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans are calculated by applying estimated loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk grade of loans 
for low risk commercial and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is pooled  based on internal risk grade  and estimates are based on a ten year net charge off history 
higher risk and criticized loans have loss factors that are derived from an analysis of both the probability of default and the probability of loss should default occur 
loss adjustment factors are applied based on criteria discussed below 
as a result  changes in risk grades of both performing and nonperforming loans affect the amount of the formula allowance 
pooled loans are loans that are usually smaller  not individually graded and homogenous in nature  such as consumer installment loans and residential mortgages 
loan loss allowances for pooled loans are based on a ten year net charge off history 
the average loss allowance per homogenous pool is based on the product of the average annual historical loss rate and the estimated duration of the pool multiplied by the pool balances 
these separate risk pools are assigned a reserve for losses based upon this historical loss information and loss adjustment factors 
historical loss adjustment factors are based upon our evaluation of various current conditions including those listed below general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  credit quality trends  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  collateral values and loan to value ratios  loan volumes and concentrations  including changes in mix  seasoning of the loan portfolio  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  bank regulatory examination results  and other factors  including changes in quality of the loan origination  servicing and risk management processes 
our loan officers and risk managers meet at least quarterly to discuss and review these conditions and risks associated with individual problem loans 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for such losses 
we also give consideration to the results of these regulatory agency examinations 
in addition  we also contract with a loan review firm to review portions of the portfolio 
during  the provision for loan losses was affected by the protracted economic recession  including increased charge offs  continued migration in loans to lower credit grades  continued deterioration of collateral values  and an increase in estimated disposition costs 
increases in the allowance for loan losses were also due to rising trends in our past due and nonperforming loans as discussed in the earlier nonperforming assets section and rising unemployment rates 
this increase in non performing loans is a direct result of the weak economic environment  impacting numerous borrowers ability to pay as scheduled 
this has resulted in increased loan delinquencies  and in some cases decreases in the collateral value used to secure real estate loans and the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
collateral value is assessed based on collateral value trends  liquidation value trends  and other liquidation expenses to determine appropriate discounts that may be needed 
in response to this deterioration in real estate loan quality  management is aggressively monitoring its classified loans and is continuing to monitor credits with material weaknesses 
as a result of continued economic deterioration in  a detailed review and analysis of our commercial loan portfolio was completed during the year 
this included a review of every commercial loan commitment greater than million  regardless of risk rating 
this represented of our commercial portfolio 
the review considered cash flows from the business or project  appropriately conservative real estate values  a careful view of guarantor support  and the direction of the economy 
our real estate portfolio has approximately million of commercial real estate loans  million of construction loans  million in first lien mortgage loans only million of which are considered subprime loans  and million in home equity loans and lines as of december  we do not have any option arm products in our portfolio 
we consider our construction loans our riskiest loans within our real estate portfolio 
construction loans are typically comprised of loans to borrowers for real estate to be developed 
normally  these loans are repaid with the proceeds from the sale or lease of the developed property 
the greater degree of strain on these real estate types of loans and the significance to our overall loan portfolio has caused us to apply a greater degree of scrutiny in analyzing the ultimate collectability of amounts due 
a number of these borrowers are having financial difficulties that may affect their ability to repay their loans 
our analysis has resulted in a significant provision expense to increase our allowance to appropriate levels based on continued deterioration in the portfolio during the table below represents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance provision for loan losses charge offs residential real estate commercial real estate commercial overdrafts consumer total charge offs recoveries residential real estate commercial real estate commercial overdrafts consumer total recoveries net charge offs ending balance net charge offs to average gross loans outstanding  net of unearned income includes commercial mortgage and construction loans 
prior to april  overdraft charge offs recoveries were recognized in other operating expense 
net charge offs did increase this year as we moved loans through the resolution process in some of the larger construction loans we identified earlier in this cycle 
during  net charge offs increased to million  or of average loans  from million  or of average loans in this is due to the fact we provide for losses earlier in the problem loan identification process when they are probable and charge the loans off and utilize the provision when the losses are certain or near certain 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated by major portfolio type 
as these portfolios have developed  they have become a source of historical data in projecting delinquencies and loss exposure  however  such allocations are not a guarantee of where future losses may occur 
while we have allocated the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type in the following table  the entire reserve is available for any loan portfolio to utilize

historically  we have had success in growing our loan portfolio 
for example  during the year ended december   net loan growth resulted in the use of million in cash 
the loan growth was primarily the result of our continued success increasing corporate and small business lending 
management expects this trend to continue 
our loan to deposit ratio has been well above for many years  however during we have made significant improvements in this ratio through increased deposit growth 
at december  our loan to deposit ratio was compared to at december  our long term goal is by management has significant experience managing its funding needs through borrowings and deposit growth 
as a financial institution  we have ready access to several sources of funding 
among these are deposit growh borrowing from the federal home loan bank fed discount window access other borrowings such as repurchase agreements cash flow from securities and loan sales and repayments net income deposit growh our current branch expansion and renovation program is focused on expanding our retail footprint in delaware and southeastern pennsylvania and attracting new customers to provide additional deposit growth 
customer deposit growth was strong  equaling million  or between december  and december  our portfolio of high quality  liquid investments  primarily short duration mortgage backed securities and agency notes also provide a source of cash flow to meet current cash needs 
if necessary  portions of this portfolio  as well as portions of the loan portfolio  could be sold to provide liquidity or new loans 
during the year ended december   million in cash was provided by operating activities 
we have a policy that separately addresses liquidity  and management monitors our adherence to policy limits 
as part of the liquidity management process  we also monitor our available wholesale funding capacity 
at december   we had million in funding capacity at the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
also  liquidity risk management is a primary area of examination by the ots 
we have not used and have no intention of using any significant off balance sheet financing arrangement for liquidity management purposes 
our financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are limited to obligations to fund loans to customers pursuant to existing commitments and obligations of letters of credit 
in addition  we have not had and have no intention to have any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could materially affect our liquidity or capital resources 
capital resources federal laws  among other things  require the ots to mandate uniformly applicable capital standards for all savings institutions 
these standards currently require institutions such as us to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to of adjusted total assets  core or leverage capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized  and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   we are classified as well capitalized  the highest regulatory defined level  and in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
additional information concerning our regulatory capital compliance is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since  the board of directors has approved several stock repurchase programs to acquire common stock outstanding 
we did not acquire any shares in  but as part of these programs  we acquired approximately  shares in at december   we held million shares of our common stock as treasury shares 
at december   we had  shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization 
on january   under the us treasury s capital purchase plan cpp  we issued and sold  shares of senior preferred stock to the us treasury  having a liquidation amount equal to  per share  or million 
although we are currently well capitalized under regulatory guidelines  the board of directors believed it was advisable to take advantage of the cpp to raise additional capital to ensure that  during these uncertain times  we are well positioned to support our existing operations as well as anticipated future growth 
additional information concerning the cpp is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the cpp program  any share repurchases or increase in the dividend level from the september quarterly payment of per share  must be approved by the us treasury department 
the company completed a private placement of stock to peninsula investment partners  lp peninsula on september   pursuant to which the company issued and sold  shares of common stock for a total purchase price of million  and a year warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
additional information concerning the peninsula transaction is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that currently have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
additional information concerning our off balance sheet arrangements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations at december   we had contractual obligations relating to operating leases  long term debt  data processing and credit obligations 
these obligations are summarized below 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations long term debt obligations data processing contracts credit obligations total impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the price of goods and services 
recent legislation the economy is experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system during the past year 
declines in the housing market during the past year  due to falling home prices and increased foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in substantial declines in mortgage related asset values  which has had a dramatic negative impact on government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
reflecting concern about the stability of the finance markets in general and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased  to provide funding and liquidity to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
pursuant to the eesa  specifically the troubled asset relief program tarp thereunder  the us treasury will have the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the secretary of the department of the treasury announced the department of the treasury will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts through tarp s cpp 
under this program  from the billion authorized by the eesa  the treasury made billion of capital available to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock as a way for healthy us financial institutions to help stabilize the us economy 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury received  from participating financial institutions  warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred stock investment 
participating financial institutions were required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity in such institution issued under the cpp 
after careful consideration of all the costs  restrictions  risks and benefits  we have elected to participate in the cpp program 
the treasury s investment signals their faith in us as a healthy institution that can help stabilize and eventually grow the economy 
additional information regarding this transaction can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on november   the board of directors of the fdic adopted a final rule relating to the temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp 
the tlgp was announced by the fdic on october   after the determination of systemic risk by the secretary of the department of treasury after consultation with the president  as an initiative to counter the system wide crisis in the nation s financial sector 
under the tlgp the fdic will i guarantee  through the earlier of maturity or june   certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions on or after october   and before june  and ii provide full fdic insurance deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts paying less than interest per annum and interest on lawyers trust accounts iolta accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions through december  coverage under the tlgp was available for the first days without charge 
the fee assessment for coverage of senior unsecured debt ranges from basis points to basis points per annum  depending on the initial maturity of the debt 
the fee assessment for deposit insurance coverage is basis points per quarter on amounts in covered accounts exceeding  we have elected to participate in the tlgp program 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
the arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  the arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients until the institution has repaid the us treasury  which is now permitted under the arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the us treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
on november   the fdic adopted a final ruling that required banks to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the th quarter of and for all of through in addition the fdic board voted to adopt a uniform three basis point increase in assessment rates effective january  prepayment of the assessments allowed the industry to strengthen the cash position of the deposit insurance fund dif immediately while allowing the capital impact to be felt over time as the industry s financial condition improves 
we have paid our estimated assessment for through of million and will expense this amount based on actual calculations of quarterly provisions during the period to which it relates 
on november   the federal reserve adopted a final ruling regarding regulation e  otherwise known as the electronic fund transfer act 
the ruling limits our ability to assess fees for overdrafts on atm or one time debit transactions without receiving prior consent from our customers who have opted in to our overdraft service 
this act will become effective on july  critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions including those related to the allowance for loan losses  contingencies including indemnifications  and deferred taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are critical accounting policies that involve more significant judgments and estimates allowance for loan losses we maintain allowances for credit losses and charge losses to these allowances when realized 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment reflecting our best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as those in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios  with consideration given to evaluations resulting from examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
contingencies including indemnifications in the ordinary course of business we are subject to legal actions  which involve claims for monetary relief 
based upon information presently available to us and our counsel  it is our opinion that any legal and financial responsibility arising from such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we maintain a loss contingency for standby letters of credit and charge losses to this reserve when such losses are realized 
the determination of the loss contingency for standby letters of credit requires significant judgment reflecting management s best estimate of probable losses 
the bank  as successor to originators of reverse mortgages is  from time to time  involved in arbitration or litigation with various parties including borrowers or the heirs of borrowers 
because reverse mortgages are a relatively new and uncommon product  there can be no assurances about how the courts or arbitrators may apply existing legal principles to the interpretation and enforcement of the terms and conditions of the bank s reverse mortgage obligations 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes asc  which requires the recording of deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly assess the need for valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets that may result from  among other things  limitations imposed by internal revenue code and uncertainties  including the timing of settlement and realization of these differences 
no valuation allowance is required as of december  fair value measurements we adopted fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc during  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc  business combinations  and fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and other intangibles are recorded at fair value 
we consider our accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical because the assumptions or judgment used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in past acquisitions are subjective and complex 
as a result  changes in these assumptions or judgment could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  including the resulting goodwill  was based either on quoted market prices or provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information was not available  estimates were made in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the assumptions that were used in the cash flow modeling were subjective and are susceptible to significant changes 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value is more than the estimated fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are periodically evaluated for impairment 
as of december   goodwill totaled million  the majority of which is in the wsfs bank reporting unit and is the result of a branch acquisition in for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  amortizing intangibles totaled million as of december  goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of fair value 
the first step compares the estimated fair value of our reporting units with their carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step would be performed that would compare the implied fair value to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
fair value may be determined using market prices  comparison to similar assets  market multiples  discounted cash flow analysis and other variables 
estimated cash flows extend five years into the future and  by their nature  are difficult to estimate over such an extended time frame 
factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  but are not limited to  balance sheet growth assumptions  credit losses in our investment and loan portfolios  competitive pressures in our market area  changes in customer base and customer product preferences  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structure  changes in discount rates  conditions in the banking sector and general economic variables 
as of december   we retained a third party valuation firm to assist in our step test for potential goodwill impairment of the wsfs bank reporting unit 
the valuation incorporated both income and market based analyses and indicated the fair value of our wsfs bank reporting unit was above the carrying amount  therefore in accordance with fasb asc  the step analysis was not required 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets were not considered impaired  however  changing economic conditions that may adversely affect our performance and stock price could result in impairment  which could adversely affect earnings in future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the matching of maturities or repricing periods of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to promote a favorable interest rate spread and mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is our primary tool for achieving our asset liability management strategies 
management regularly reviews our interest rate sensitivity and adjusts the sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management 
at december  interest earning liabilities exceeded interest bearing assets that mature or reprice within one year interest sensitive gap by million 
our interest sensitive assets as a percentage of interest sensitive liabilities within the one year window decreased from at december  to at december  likewise  the one year interest sensitive gap as a percentage of total assets changed to at december  from at december  the change in sensitivity since december  is the result of the current interest rate environment and our continuing effort to effectively manage interest rate risk 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing and funding activities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure 
one measure required to be performed by the office of thrift supervision ots regulated institutions is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
a  management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivatives activities 
this test measures the impact on the net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of the estimated cash flows from assets and liabilities as a percentage of the net present value of assets 
the following table is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and net portfolio value at the specified levels at december  and  calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
a december  change in interest rate basis points change in net interest margin net portfolio value change in net interest margin net portfolio value nmf nmf nm f nm f nmf nmf nm f nm f the percentage difference between net interest margin in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected under the various rate change environments 
the net portfolio value ratio of the company in a stable interest rate environment and the net portfolio value as projected under the various rate change environments 
sensitivity indicated by a decrease of and basis points is deemed not meaningful nmf at december  given the low absolute level of interest rates at that time 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while maximizing the yield cost spread on our asset liability structure 
we rely primarily on our asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
we also engage in other business activities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for example  mortgage banking revenues and expenses can fluctuate with changing interest rates 
these fluctuations are difficult to model and estimate 
during the first quarter of we executed million of intermediate term fhlb advances in order to reduce the sensitivity of our net interest income to increases in market interest rates
