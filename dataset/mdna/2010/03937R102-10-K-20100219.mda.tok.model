the company s minimum funding requirements are dependent on several factors  including the discount rate and investment returns  and any changes in legislation 
at the current time it is not possible to reasonably predict future contributions by year 
based upon the assumption that interest rates will remain at or near the levels at december   that the annual rate of return on assets will be  that mortality rates will remain consistent with december  assumptions  and there are no changes in existing legislation  it would be reasonable to assume that contributions to the qualified us plan over the next seven years will total to an amount broadly equal to the current funding deficit approximately million plus an annual amount equal to the current service cost approximately million in over the period

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the accounting policies used 
certain accounting policies require that estimates and assumptions be made by management for use in the preparation of the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results and that require subjective or complex estimates by management 
these include the following goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and identified intangible assets on a business by business basis reporting unit for impairment 
the company evaluates each reporting unit for impairment based upon a two step approach 
first  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
second  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in measuring the implied fair value of goodwill  the company would allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to each of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company measures the fair value of a reporting unit as the estimated discounted future cash flows  including a terminal value  which assumes the business continues in perpetuity 
the long term terminal growth assumptions reflect our current long term view of the marketplace 
the discount rate is based upon our weighted average cost of capital of each reporting unit 
each year the company re evaluates the assumptions in the discounted cash flow model to address changes in the business and marketplace conditions 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows in conducting an impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be impacted by future actions taken by the company and its competitors and the volatility in the markets in which the company conducts business 
a change in assumptions in the company s cash flows could have a significant impact on the fair value of the company s reporting units  which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company s results of operations 
based upon the annual impairment analysis  which was completed in the first quarter of  the estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value and as a result  the company did not need to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
since the first quarter of  no events or changes in circumstances  have occurred to indicate that an impairment could exist 
fourth quarter goodwill impairment background information the industrial coatings business was negatively impacted by the decline in the local furniture maker market in several of the major european economies as a result of the shift of manufacturing to countries with low cost production 
the company s industrial coatings business is principally concentrated in europe  unlike our other businesses that are more geographically diversified 
the industrial coatings business  to a greater extent  was also being impacted by competitive activities within europe  principally in italy the business largest sales region  as competitors attempted to gain market share  in particular  one competitor began recruiting and hiring several of the company s employees  agents and distributors 
in response to these activities  the business was unable to maintain profitability in the face of rising raw material prices 
as a result  the business began to see declines in sales volumes and overall margins 
the company s industrial coatings export business took advantage of its strong positions in growing markets in russia and eastern europe to offset some of the shortfalls in volumes in the other regions 
consequently  the operating income for the business declined from approximately million in 
table of contents to slightly positive for and additionally  the industrial coatings cash flows had declined from million in to million in when the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during january  it considered the factors above and concluded that the goodwill of its industrial coatings business was not impaired 
assumptions underlying this conclusion included expected volume growth driven by geographic expansion and market growth supported by new product introductions and price increases in order to achieve profit improvement 
the rapid deterioration of the global economy during the fourth quarter of  which could not be foreseen in january  significantly compounded the existing adverse factors identified above  and was the principal reason for the interim test 
this economic slowdown intensified throughout the fourth quarter of as weakness spread to the broader worldwide economy  negatively impacting many of our customers in the industrial coatings business and our expectations of a recovery in these markets 
at this point  the business began seeing volumes decline to from the prior year levels and that the industrial coatings market was going to continue to contract through most of and that there would be a slow recovery 
the united kingdom was also adversely impacted by the weakening of the british pound versus the euro  since it purchases much of its materials in euros 
due to the competitive environment  the company was not able to pass along price increases to offset the foreign exchange impact on the cost of imported materials 
as a result  the company s projected future cash flows for and beyond were adversely impacted and were significantly lower in december than the projections used in the company s january annual impairment review 
the goodwill impairment testing process involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity  which include estimating a reporting unit s discounted cash flows  selecting a discount rate and long term growth assumptions 
estimating a reporting unit s discounted cash flows involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to a variety of factors  including sales  gross margin  operating expenses  working capital fluctuations  capital expenditures and cash flows  all of which are based on the company s annual strategic business plan or other forecasted results 
the company s historical annual cash flow projections  on average  have been consistent with actual cash flows 
the company uses the prevailing foreign exchange rates at the time of the forecast for all years included in the projections 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital for each of the reporting units 
the long term terminal growth assumptions reflect our current long term view of each business 
additionally  the allocation of the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units to the estimated fair value of their net assets also involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments 
both the estimates of the fair value of the company s reporting units and the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting units to their net assets are based on the best information available to the company s management as of the date of the assessment 
as part of the impairment review process  the company compares the value of the company s reporting units  which is derived from the discounted cash flows  to the company s market capitalization 
at the end of  the company s market capitalization had not declined  and was not a factor for the interim impairment test 
change in assumptions from the annual impairment review to the interim impairment review the material change in assumptions from the january annual impairment test to the december interim impairment test was principally related to projected lower volumes for the business in through  and to a lesser extent  lower margins 
due to the aforementioned items  the company reduced its base volume assumptions as well as the estimated volume growth in its projections for through  as the company no longer expected the magnitude and pace of the growth and recovery of profitability that was anticipated earlier driven by geographic expansion and new product introductions 
to the contrary  in the fourth quarter of  the company believed that the industrial coatings market was going to continue to contract through most of and that there would be a slow recovery 
additionally  price increases to achieve profit improvement and to offset rising raw material costs  were lower due to the competitive pressures 
although the industrial coatings business saw increased competitive activities during the fourth quarter of  the change in 
table of contents forecasted cash flows was not due to the business losing any major customers and the company does not believe that it has seen a reduction to its percentage of market share 
the projected lower volumes for the business were mainly the result of an overall contraction of the market 
although the industrial coatings business cash flows were consistent with original projections  the company s december projections of future cash flows were significantly lower than the projections used in the company s january annual impairment review for and beyond  as a result of this rapid deterioration of the global economy in the fourth quarter of the assumption of lower volumes and lower margins significantly impacted the estimated future cash flows of the business 
the company s january impairment test estimated cash flows of approximately million in increasing to approximately to million annually in future years 
the december projected cash flows decreased from approximately million in to slightly positive in  million in and recovering to approximately to million annually thereafter  which  after considering the change in the discount rate  resulted in a decrease of the net present value for the cash flows of approximately million 
the company adjusted the discount rate from in the january test to in december in order to reflect current market risks 
approximately million of the decrease in estimated fair value of the business is due to the change in discount rate 
the company has kept its long term growth rate consistent in both calculations at  based on our long term assessment of the market subsequent to fourth quarter interim impairment assessment as a result of the update to the company s financial forecast  due to the aforementioned items and in connection with the year end review of our accounts  the company conducted an interim impairment review using a combination of valuation methodologies  including a discounted cash flow model 
such review indicated that there was an impairment on the goodwill of the industrial coatings business 
as the updated estimate of the reporting unit s fair value was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  the company performed step of the goodwill impairment test 
based upon an analysis of fair value  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  which eliminated the remaining carrying amount of goodwill related to the industrial coatings business acquired in conjunction with the company s acquisition of hickson international plc in august of for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets include certain deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies  and may result in the recording of a valuation reserve 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or ability to implement tax planning strategies could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefits the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate the benefits the employees earn while 
table of contents working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
inherent in these valuations are financial assumptions including expected returns on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities could be settled  rates of increase of health care costs  rates of future compensation increases as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns  mortality and turnover 
the company reviews the assumptions annually with its actuarial advisors 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
the following is a discussion of the most significant estimates and assumptions used in connection with the company s us and the hickson us employee benefit plans 
the pension expense for other defined benefit plans for the company s other foreign subsidiaries was not significant  and accordingly assumptions and sensitivity analyses regarding these plans are not included in the discussion below 
key assumptions the assets  liabilities and assumptions used to measure expense for any fiscal year are determined as of january of the current plan year 
accumulated and projected benefit obligations represent the present value of future cash payments 
the expected return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations 
the assumption reflects long term expectations for future rates of return for the investment portfolio over the life of the benefit obligations  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class 
the company s expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the hickson uk pension plans includes a reduction to allow for administration expenses 
the discount rate reflects the yields available on high quality fixed income instruments 
the discount rate for the us plans is based on the review of the following moody s aa corporate bond index  a pension liability index and a yield curve constructed from a large population of high quality non callable corporate bonds  modeled to match the expected timing of the benefit payments over the life of the benefit obligation 
the discount rate for the hickson uk plans is based upon a review of corporate bond yields 
sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of changes in key assumptions for our principal pension and postretirement plans expense are as follows discount rate a basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the expense of the company s us pension plans and hickson uk pension benefit plans by approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
in addition  a similar change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the projected benefit obligation by approximately million for the company s us plans and approximately million for the hickson uk plans 
expected return on plan assets a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease the expense for the company s us and hickson us pension benefit plans by approximately million and million  respectively 
this change would have no impact on the projected benefit obligation for either plan 
mortality assumptions a change in mortality tables for the company s us pension plans that increases or decreases age life expectancy by one year would increase or decrease the pension expense by approximately million and increase or decrease the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a percent change in the mortality rates for the hickson uk plans would increase or decrease the pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately million and million  respectively

table of contents valuation of long lived assets the impairment of tangible and intangible assets is assessed when changes in circumstances such as  but not limited to  a decrease in market value of an asset  current and historical operating losses or a change in business strategy indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based on estimates of future cash flows  salvage values or net sales proceeds 
these estimates take into account management s expectations and judgments regarding future business and economic conditions  future market values and disposal costs 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
environmental liabilities liabilities for environmental matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
these estimates take into account current law  existing technologies and management s judgment about future changes in regulation 
each quarter  and when there are changes in circumstances  the company formally evaluates known and potential sites 
the company reviews estimates for future remediation  and maintenance and management costs directly related to remediation  to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts 
for each site  a determination is made of the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site  the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan  the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by the company and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur 
the company s estimate of environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified  further remediation measures be required or undertaken or current laws and regulations be changed 
for additional information  see the environmental discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates its current proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel and when there are changes in circumstances 
these contingencies require management judgment in order to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
the company assesses its legal liabilities separately from any potential insurance recovery or indemnification 
as such  we record legal liabilities on a gross basis  unless a right of set off exists 
any benefit from the insurance recoveries or that result from an indemnification by another party are recorded when the company is reasonably certain the other party will fulfill its obligation 
the company s insurance coverage provides coverage on a reimbursement basis  therefore  there may be a lag between any payment ultimately paid by the company and reimbursement of such payment from the company s insurers 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
incentive compensation the company maintains a long term employee incentive compensation plan that is intended to reward eligible employees for their contributions to the company s long term success 
provisions for employee incentive compensation are included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company s financial target for the long term incentive plan is return on equity to be achieved in three years  which can be accelerated and earned in two years 
the financial targets are set annually by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
if the financial targets are not going to be achieved at the end of year three  one half of the award is forfeited and the remaining award is earned over the remaining three year period 
therefore  changes in the company s estimated financial performance could have a significant 
table of contents impact on the amount of compensation expense recorded by the company in any given period 
since certain awards in the company s long term incentive plan are paid out in cash based upon market price of the company s common stock  the amount of incentive compensation expense will vary based upon the market price of the company s stock at the end of each reporting period 
the company has entered into equity total return swap agreements in order to minimize earnings volatility related to fluctuations in the company s stock price
