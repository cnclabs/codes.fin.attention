item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview epicor software corporation epicor or the company designs  develops  markets and supports enterprise application software solutions and services primarily for use by midsized companies and the divisions and subsidiaries of global enterprises  which generally consist of companies with annual revenues between million and billion  and emerging enterprises  which generally consist of rapidly growing businesses with annual revenues under million 
epicor s solutions are designed to help companies focus on their customers  suppliers  partners and employees through enterprise wide management of resources and information 
this collaborative focus distinguishes the company from conventional enterprise resource planning erp vendors  whose primary focus is improving internal business processes and efficiencies 
the company believes that by automating and integrating information and critical business processes across their entire value chain  enterprises can improve not just their bottom line  but also their top line  allowing them to compete more effectively in today s increasingly global economy 
the financial market crisis at the end of and early has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide and has led to weakness in the global economic environment 
while the effect of the weakness of the global economy is expected to continue to challenge epicor s ability to sell software licenses and may negatively impact demand for our consulting services and retail hardware systems  towards the end of the company began to see some signs of improvement in revenue 
specifically  license and maintenance revenues for the fourth quarter each exceeded the fourth quarter license and maintenance revenues 
the adverse economic environment has also increased the difficulty of forecasting revenues  as a decrease in license revenue may lead to a decrease in consulting revenue in the same or subsequent quarters 
lower license revenue may also decrease maintenance revenue since maintenance fees for new product licenses are directly related to software license sales 
in late  in response to the difficult economic environment  epicor took steps to reduce its headcount and lower expenses and continued to do so in on a more limited basis in targeted areas 
the company continues to monitor the economic situation  the business environment and the company s outlook 
total revenues for the year ended december   decreased to million  compared to million for the year ended december  net license revenue decreased by to million for the year ended december   when compared to net license revenue of million for the year ended december  net license revenue improved in the fourth quarter and was the highest of the year 
fourth quarter net license revenue was significantly up sequentially over third quarter net license revenue and also increased when compared to net license revenues in the fourth quarter of consulting revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of compared to consulting revenue of million for the year ended december  maintenance revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of compared to maintenance revenue of million for the year ended december  on a quarterly basis  maintenance revenues improved sequentially throughout the year  and in the fourth quarter of maintenance revenues increased when compared to the fourth quarter of hardware and other revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of compared to hardware and other revenue of million for the year ended december  see discussion in results of operations for more detailed information 
overall gross margin was for the year ended december   compared to for overall gross margin improved principally due to cost reduction measures taken during the year  primarily in consulting and maintenance 
overall gross margins also benefited from a larger mix of higher margin revenues  as hardware revenues  which have significantly lower gross margins  were down significantly from cash flows from operations were million during the year ended december   compared to cash flows from operations of million 
cash flows from operating activities decreased due primarily due to lower license sales and less revenues from corresponding software implementations and less cash collected on accounts receivable and for deferred revenue during  as compared to the company reported a net loss of million  or 
per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or 
per diluted share  for the year ended december  net loss for and include significant non cash charges primarily consisting of amortization of intangible assets of million and million  stock based compensation expense of million and million  amortization of long term debt discount of million and million  and the write off of debt issuance fees of million 
table of contents and  respectively 
net loss for and also includes restructuring and other charges of million and million  respectively 
the net loss for both years excludes revenues that would have been recorded if nsb s deferred revenues had not been adjusted to fair value in purchase accounting equaling million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states of america generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as such  management is required to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies which are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company enters into contractual arrangements with end users that may include licensing of the company s software products  product support and maintenance services  consulting services  resale of third party hardware or various combinations thereof  including the sale of such products or services separately 
the company s accounting policies regarding the recognition of revenue for these contractual arrangements is fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers many factors when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america related to revenue recognition 
these factors include  but are not limited to the actual contractual terms  such as payment terms  delivery dates and pricing of the various product and service elements of a contract  availability of products to be delivered  time period over which services are to be performed  creditworthiness of the customer  the complexity of customizations and integrations to the company s software required by service contracts  the sales channel through which the sale is made direct  var  distributor  etc  discounts given for each element of a contract  any commitments made as to installation or implementation go live dates  and whether vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists 
each of the relevant factors is analyzed to determine its impact  individually and collectively with other factors  on the revenue to be recognized for any particular contract with a customer 
management is required to make judgments regarding the significance of each factor in applying the revenue recognition standards  as well as whether or not each factor complies with such standards 
any misjudgment or error by management in its evaluation of the factors and the application of the standards  especially with respect to complex or new types of transactions  could have a material adverse affect on the company s future revenues and operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable go through a collection process that is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with customers at specified intervals and assistance from other personnel within the company who have a relationship with the customer 
the company writes off accounts to its allowance when the company has determined that collection is not likely 
the company believes no significant concentrations of credit risk existed at december  receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collections performance and specific collection issues 
if actual bad debts differ from the reserves calculated  the company records an adjustment to bad debt expense in the period in which the difference occurs 
such adjustment could result in additional charges to the company s results of operations 

table of contents intangible assets the company s intangible assets were recorded as a result of the company s acquisitions and represent acquired technology  customer base and trademarks 
these intangible assets are amortized over the estimated economic life of the asset 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the intangible assets and considers any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
any material changes in circumstances  such as large decreases in revenue or the discontinuation of a particular product line  could require future write downs in the company s intangibles assets and could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the periods in which such write downs occur 
goodwill goodwill was recorded as a result of the company s acquisitions 
the company has recorded these acquisitions using the acquisition method and purchase method of accounting 
the company annually performs an impairment review of its recorded goodwill  and in determined that no impairment of goodwill existed because the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
the company tests its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if indicators of potential impairment exist  by determining if the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
factors that could trigger an interim impairment test include  but are not limited to  underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends and a sustained period where market capitalization  plus an appropriate control premium  is less than stockholders equity 
future impairment reviews may require write downs in the company s goodwill and could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the periods in which such write downs occur 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component defined as a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by component managers 
for the company  the reporting units are the operating segments 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using an average of a market approach and an income approach 
the market approach utilizes a guideline company method  which derives applicable market multiples from the prices at which public companies that are comparable to our reporting units are trading in an active marketplace 
the company believes the market approach generally provides a meaningful indicator of fair value as it reflects the current value at which shares of comparable companies are actively traded in a free and open market 
the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow method dcf that estimates after tax cash flows on a debt free basis  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the company believes the dcf provides a meaningful indicator of fair value as well  since it appropriately measures the income producing assets and reflects the income potential that would establish the amount paid by an investor 
the key assumptions used in the market approach included the use of comparable publicly traded companies  which the company considered to be other software  technology and consulting companies in epicor s industry 
the selection of revenue and earnings multiples was based on similarity of size  earnings growth  profitability and other qualitative factors relative to each reporting unit 
the application of adjustments for a control premium and for risk and growth considerations  which were consistent with premiums and considerations in recent acquisitions 
the key assumptions used in the dcf approach included the reporting unit s projected future financial results 
revenue growth rates represent estimates based on current and forecasted revenue mix and market conditions 
the profit margins were projected by each reporting unit based on historical margins  projected sales mix and current expense structure 
the projected terminal value  which reflected the total present value of projected cash flows beyond the last period in the dcf 
this value reflected the company s estimate for stable  perpetual growth of each reporting unit 
the discount rate was set by using a weighted average cost of capital method that considered market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors 

table of contents the company utilized a combination of income and market approaches to determine the fair values of its reporting units 
the company believes these approaches provide the best indications of the fair values 
to corroborate its calculations  the company performed sensitivity analysis and reconciled its total market capitalization value to the sum of the fair values of the three reporting units 
the company s market capitalization was in line with the sum of the fair values of the reporting units when a nominal control premium is factored in that the company believes is consistent with acquisition premiums in its industry 
based on the company s calculations and analysis  the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the respective carrying value and the company concluded no impairment to goodwill 
based on the results of the first step of the impairment test  the second step was not required and no impairment was recognized 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that the fair value of any of the company s reporting units under the guidelines discussed above has fallen below its carrying value  the company will compare the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value 
if the book value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the company will recognize the difference as an impairment charge in the determination of operating income 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends  volatility  terms and estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from the estimate  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
beginning in  the company changed its previous practice of predominantly granting stock options to employees  and began granting primarily performance based and time based restricted stock as an alternative 
compensation expense for restricted stock is based on the fair market value of the restricted stock on its grant date  and is expensed ratably over the vesting period 
performance based restricted stock vests upon the attainment of specific performance targets 
the measurement date of restricted stock containing performance based vesting is the date the restricted stock grant is authorized and the specific performance goals are communicated 
compensation expense is recognized based on the probability that the performance criteria will be met 
the recognition of compensation expense associated with performance based vesting requires judgment in assessing the probability of meeting the performance goals  as well as defined criteria for assessing achievement of the performance related goals 
the continued assessment of probability may result in additional expense recognition or expense reversal depending on the level of achievement of the performance goals 
income taxes the company provides for income taxes based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year 
the income tax provision benefit is computed on the pretax income loss of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction based on current tax law 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability and has established a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment  the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
the company applies a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 

table of contents although the company believes it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite the company s belief that its tax return positions are supportable  the company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
the company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
united states income taxes were not provided for on unremitted earnings from certain non united states subsidiaries 
those unremitted earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested

acquisition nsb retail systems plc on february   the company completed its acquisition of nsb retail systems plc nsb 
nsb designs  develops  markets and supports store and merchandising solutions to retailers of apparel  footwear and specialty merchandise 
the acquisition of nsb provides an expanded portfolio of products and services for large and mid sized specialty retailers and department stores  as well as a fully hosted  managed service offering designed for smaller retailers who are interested in rapid implementation via an on demand versus on premise offering

the total purchase price for nsb is shown below in thousands cash transaction costs total purchase price the acquisition of nsb is accounted for as a purchase business combination 
under the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price was allocated to nsb s tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of february   with any excess being ascribed to goodwill 
management is primarily responsible for determining the fair values of these assets 
the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represent management s estimate of fair values

the in process research and development projects arose from new products that were under development at the date of the acquisition and were expected to eventually lead to new products but had not yet established technological feasibility and for which no future alternative use was identified 
the valuation of the in process research and development projects was based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the products over the products expected life  reflecting the estimated stage of completion of the projects and the estimate of the costs to complete the projects 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for pro forma information related to this acquisition 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table summarizes certain aspects of the company s results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in millions  except percentages year ended december change change change as adjusted revenues license consulting maintenance hardware and other total revenues gross profit license consulting maintenance hardware and other amortization of intangible assets of total revenues gross profit of revenues sales and marketing of revenues software development of revenues general and administrative of revenues in process research and development of revenues restructuring and other of revenues interest expense of revenues interest and other income  net of revenues benefit for income taxes effective tax rate net loss of revenues 
table of contents revenue the decrease in license revenues for the year ended december   compared to  is due primarily to the downturn of the overall economic environment  which led to lengthening sales cycles and a decrease in near term demand for the company s software solutions 
due to continued uncertainty regarding the state of the economy and continued limited access to credit  as well as the cost of credit  customers continue to be reluctant to sign new deals  while others are implementing projects on a staged basis whereby they purchase and roll out smaller parts of their total solution

this is offset by continued high renewal rates in the company s customer base  continued new license sales and related maintenance contracts sold with new licenses and continued focus on re signing customers whose maintenance agreements had previously lapsed  but who have now renewed their maintenance agreements 
hardware and other revenues consist primarily of the resale of third party hardware 
the decrease in hardware and other revenue for the year ended december   as compared to  is due to the timing of customer hardware orders  which vary based on the customers hardware roll out schedules  resulting in a high degree of variability in the company s hardware revenues 
international revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  representing and  respectively  of total revenues 
the decrease in international revenues as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the strengthening of the united states dollar relative to other major currencies

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in foreign currency based revenues during the year ended december  being reported million  or  lower than these revenues would have been if they had been translated at foreign currency exchange rates 
cost of revenues and gross margins cost of license revenues consists primarily of software royalties paid for third party software incorporated into the company s products  referral fees paid to value added resellers vars  costs associated with product packaging and documentation and software duplication 
for the year ended december   compared to  gross profit on license revenue decreased slightly due to lower revenue  which was offset partially by decreased costs due primarily to a lower mix of third party software sales 
cost of consulting revenues consists primarily of salaries  benefits  commissions  bonuses  other headcount related expenses and travel for the company s consulting organization  which provides consulting services to customers in the implementation and integration of the company s software products  as well as education  training and other consulting and programming services 
these costs decreased in absolute dollars during the year ended december   compared to  primarily due to headcount reductions related to the company s restructuring activities in and  as well as a continued focus on expense management  offset by the acquisition of nsb  whose costs were included for all of also  the strengthening of the united states dollar relative to other currencies decreased costs as a large percentage of the consulting staff is outside the united states 
consulting services margins increased for the year ended december   compared to  due primarily to the decreased costs  and the impact in the first quarter of of a strategic consulting contract with a large customer for whom the company had to adjust estimated costs and record future estimated losses 
cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of salaries  benefits and other personnel related expenses for the company s support organization as well as maintenance royalties on third party software incorporated into the 
table of contents company s products

for the years ended december  and  the company recorded amortization expense  included in cost of revenues  related to intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in amortization expense for the year ended december   as compared to  is due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the period

table of contents stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense includes compensation expense from restricted stock issued and stock options granted by the company 
for the years ended december  and  stock based compensation expense was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense increased due primarily to changes in senior management and additional shares granted 
at december   there was approximately million and million of unrecognized compensation expense related to performance based restricted stock and other restricted stock grants  respectively 
these costs are expected to be recognized over weighted average periods of approximately one year 
the compensation cost related to the performance based restricted stock depends on the estimated number of shares that will vest based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions 
therefore  the recognized compensation could vary significantly depending on the outcome of those conditions 
the company is required at each reporting date to assess whether achievement of any performance condition is probable 
quarterly compensation expense may include a cumulative adjustment resulting from changes in the estimated number of shares expected to be earned during that plan year 
based on the company s achievement of performance conditions applicable to the performance year  the company has recorded compensation expense of million related to performance based restricted stock for the year ended december  in addition to the above plans  in january  the company s board of directors decided to expand the company s performance based restricted stock program for and eliminate the company s prior cash based management bonus plan for the compensation cost related to the additional performance based restricted stock depends on the estimated number of shares that will vest based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions  similar to the existing performance based restricted stock 
unrecognized compensation cost associated with the additional performance based restricted stock expected to be recognized in is million 
because the additional performance based restricted stock replaces the company s management cash bonus  overall expense for the company is not expected to increase significantly 
the following table sets forth the total stock based compensation expense resulting from restricted stock awards and stock options included in the company s consolidated statements of operations in thousands year ended december  cost of consulting revenues cost of maintenance revenues sales and marketing software development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense restructuring and other for the year ended december   the company recorded restructuring and other charges of million

the company recorded a net credit of million related to changes in estimates on subleased facilities and charges related to closing facilities used in its retail business 
the company also recorded million in asset impairments related to leasehold improvements and facilities redundancies in the company s retail business resulting from the nsb acquisition 
interest expense interest expense was relatively consistent for the year ended december   compared to interest expense is comprised of interest on the company s convertible debt and credit facility  debt discount amortization  debt issuance fees amortization and debt issuance fees write offs 

table of contents interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  increased slightly for the year ended december   compared to  due primarily to an increase in the value of deferred compensation assets in the current year  a lower loss in the current year on foreign currency losses relating to the strengthening of the united states dollar  offset by a change related to the company s interest rate swaps and a decrease in interest earned on the company s cash balances as a result of lower cash balances compared to early benefit for income taxes the benefit for income taxes consists of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the company operates in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside the united states 
accordingly  the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in the various locations and the applicable rates 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at different rates  state taxes  permanent differences between gaap pre tax income and taxable income  changes in valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets and releases of reserves for uncertain tax positions primarily related to statute closures and expected audit settlements in foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at different rates  state taxes  permanent differences between gaap pre tax income and taxable income  and changes in valuation allowances primarily in foreign jurisdictions 
the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by recognition of an uncertain tax position relating to settlement of a foreign audit and certain statutes closing 
the company maintains a million and million valuation allowance at december  and  respectively  for certain deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
the valuation allowance is principally related to net operating losses for which the recovery is uncertain 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and has established a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment  the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
given the increased global scope of our operations  and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing regulations  it has become increasingly difficult to estimate earnings within each tax jurisdiction 
if actual earnings within a tax jurisdiction differ materially from our estimates  an adjustment to income would occur if we determine that we are able to realize a different amount of our deferred tax assets than currently expected

one of the sales greater than million in was related to the sale of a non strategic asset see sale of non strategic asset 
consulting revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  due to the acquisition of nsb and an increase in international managed services  which is a newly provided service  offset by decreased consulting revenue due to a significant international engagement in the prior period with no similar engagement in the current period 
consulting revenues were also negatively impacted by a strategic consulting deal with a large customer that required the company to allocate significant consulting resources to this project with little additional associated revenues 
the increase in maintenance revenues for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  is due primarily to the acquisition of nsb  which contributed maintenance revenues during the year  as well as continued high renewal rates in the company s customer base  continuing new license sales and related maintenance contracts sold with new licenses  and continued focus on re signing customers whose maintenance agreements had previously lapsed  but who have now renewed their maintenance agreements 
hardware and other revenues consist primarily of the resale of third party hardware

stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense includes compensation expense from stock options granted and restricted stock issued by the company 
for the years ended december  and  stock based compensation expense was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense decreased due primarily to changes in senior management as well as not issuing as many shares related to the performance based restricted stock plan

therefore  the recognized compensation could vary significantly  depending on the outcome of those conditions 
the company is required at each reporting date to assess whether achievement of any performance condition is probable 
quarterly compensation expense may include a cumulative adjustment resulting from changes in the estimated number of 
table of contents shares expected to be earned during that plan year

based on an estimated fair value of the payroll bureau  the company allocated million of the total consideration to the sale of these assets as well 
this consideration  less the carrying amounts of million of goodwill and million of net customer base intangible assets originally recorded in connection with the acquisition of scala and  of net tangible assets  resulted in a net gain of million which is included in gain on sale of non strategic asset in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the remaining consideration related to the iscala payroll product license is included in license in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due primarily to a decrease in interest earned on the company s cash balances as well as increased foreign currency transaction losses

excluding a loss of million in the first quarter of resulting from the change in value of the company s british pound sterling call option contracts related to the nsb acquisition  the company had foreign currency transaction losses for the year ended december  of million  primarily due to the company s intercompany translation and the significant strengthening of the united states dollar against the british pound sterling  australian dollar and the euro 

table of contents benefit for income taxes the benefit for income taxes consists of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the company operates in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside the united states 
accordingly  the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in the various locations and the applicable rates 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at different rates  state taxes  permanent differences between gaap pre tax income and taxable income  and changes in valuation allowances primarily in foreign jurisdictions 
the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by recognition of an uncertain tax position relating to settlement of a foreign audit and certain statutes closing 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory us federal income tax rate of primarily due to a non cash income tax benefit resulting from the release of certain foreign valuation allowances 
effective january   any reduction to the valuation allowance established in purchase accounting is to be accounted for as a reduction in income tax expense 
the company maintains a million and million valuation allowance at december  and  respectively  for certain deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
the valuation allowance is principally related to net operating losses for which the recovery is uncertain 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and has established a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment  the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
given the increased global scope of our operations  and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing regulations  it has become increasingly difficult to estimate earnings within each tax jurisdiction 
if actual earnings within a tax jurisdiction differ materially from our estimates  an adjustment to income would occur if we determine that we are able to realize a different amount of our deferred tax assets than currently expected 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the company s cash and cash equivalents  working capital  long term debt and cash flows as of and for the year ended december  in millions cash and cash equivalents working capital net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities long term debt  less current portion overview as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million in net working capital current assets in excess of current liabilities 
the company s primary sources of operating cash are customer payments for license fees  consulting services and maintenance contracts 
the company s primary use of operating cash is for employee costs  third party software royalties  and facilities 
the company s working capital excluding deferred revenue is million 
the company believes this is a relevant measurement of working capital since deferred revenue is an obligation for services rather than for cash 
the cost of providing these services is generally fixed in nature and ranges from to of the related revenues 
the company s cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the united states 
in some countries  repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states  but under current law  would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the location where it is needed 
the company s days sales outstanding dso for the last eight quarters are set forth in the following table quarter ended march june september december the increase in dsos in the first quarter of was due primarily to the company s higher accounts receivable balances without related revenues as a result of the nsb acquisition 
although the company experienced relatively shorter payment cycles during most of  these cycles began to lengthen during the fourth quarter of and continued into due primarily to the volatility surrounding the financial markets and uncertainty regarding the state of the economy as well as the tightening of the credit market 
as of december   the company had million in cash obligations for severance costs  lease terminations and other costs related to the company s restructurings 
these obligations are expected to be paid through and the company believes these obligations will be funded from existing cash reserves and cash generated from continuing operations 
considering current cash reserves  funds from future operations and availability of funds under the company s credit facility  management believes that the company will have sufficient liquidity to continue its operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  the company may require additional sources of liquidity to fund any future acquisitions and its future growth 
there can be no assurance that the company will not seek to raise additional capital through the incurrence of debt or issuance of equity securities in the future 
the company is dependent upon its ability to generate cash flows from license and other operating revenues  providing services to its customers and on collection of its accounts receivable to maintain current liquidity levels 
if the company is not successful in achieving targeted revenues and expenses or positive cash flows from operations  the company may be required to take further cost cutting measures and restructuring actions or seek alternative sources of funding 
as of december   the company had million in borrowing capacity available under its credit facility 
borrowing capacity under the credit facility may be reduced or otherwise limited as a result of the 
table of contents company s obligation to comply with certain financial covenants 
the company increased its leverage to finance its crs and nsb acquisitions 
as described below  as of december   the company had million outstanding convertible notes and million outstanding under its credit facility 
this indebtedness may reduce the company s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or fund capital expenditures or working capital needs because the company may require additional sources of liquidity to fund any future acquisitions and its future growth 
while the company currently expects that additional capital will be available to it through the incurrence of debt or issuance of equity securities  these alternative sources of funding may not be available on terms favorable to the company or at all  in which case  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 
operating activities the company s operations provided million in cash during the year ended december  cash flows from operating activities were generated even though the company reported million of net loss 
cash flows from operating activities differed from the net loss partially because of non cash charges primarily consisting of million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation expense  million of provision for doubtful accounts  million of debt issuance fee amortization  million of debt discount amortization and million of restructuring charges 
net working capital changes decreased overall cash provided from operations by million 
the working capital changes relate primarily to a decrease in other current assets of million and a decrease in accrued restructuring costs of million offset by million in inventory usage 
investing activities the company s principal investing activities for the year ended december   included million for capital expenditures and million in business combination costs 
financing activities financing activities for the year ended december   included million in payments on the credit facility  million in proceeds from the revolver see below  million in debt issuance fees and million for the purchase of treasury stock

cash provided by financing activities also included proceeds from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of million 
credit facility on december   the company entered into a syndicated credit facility the credit facility for up to million in term loan and revolving facilities  consisting of million term loan and million in revolving loan facility after giving effect to an accordion feature 
funds from the credit facility were allowed to be used to finance the nsb acquisition and to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the nsb acquisition  and following such acquisition  to provide ongoing working capital and to be used for other general corporate purposes 
the company pledged all of its assets as collateral  subject to certain exceptions 
the terms of the credit facility include various covenant compliance requirements 
amounts repaid under the term loan may not be re borrowed 
on december   the company amended the credit facility to  among other things  reduce the commitments under the revolving loan facility from million to million 
on september   the company amended the credit facility to  among other things i amend the financial covenants by eliminating the total leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  lowering the maximum senior secured leverage ratio and adding a minimum ebitda covenant and a minimum liquidity ratio  ii amend the maturity date from february  to september   and iii increase the applicable interest rates and commitment fees payable under the facility 
upon entering into the amendment  the company was required to repay in full the outstanding term loan facility  which had an outstanding principal balance of million 
on september   the company paid the outstanding term loan balance by drawing million under the revolving facility and paying million from discretionary funds 
on december   the company made an additional payment of million from discretionary funds 
as a result  the company had million outstanding and unused borrowing capacity of million under the revolver at december  as a result of the september  amendment to the credit facility  the company is required to comply with the following financial covenants from september  through the remainder of the term of the 
table of contents credit facility i maximum senior leverage ratio  ii minimum ebitda ratio  and iii minimum liquidity ratio  all measured on a consolidated basis

under the senior leverage ratio covenant  the company s senior leverage  consisting of amounts outstanding under the credit facility and any other secured borrowings  may not exceed two times the ebitda for the preceding month period  as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
under the minimum ebitda ratio  the company s ebitda for the preceding month period  as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter  must be at least million 
under the minimum liquidity ratio  the ratio of a the sum of i unrestricted cash and ii accounts receivable to b the sum of i current liabilities exclusive of amounts outstanding under the credit facility  plus ii amounts outstanding under the credit facility  minus iii deferred revenue  minus iv accounts payable for inventory held for resale  may be no less than aa to for fiscal quarters ended september and december   bb to for fiscal quarters ending march and june   cc to for the fiscal quarter ending september   and dd to for the fiscal quarters ending on or after december  interest under the credit facility is variable  and at december   the effective weighted average interest rate was 
at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants included in the terms of the credit facility 
on april   march  and march   the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the company s interest rate variability to a fixed rate basis as required under the credit facility in connection with the term loan there under 
the interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment at the time 
the agreements effectively convert the company s floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this reduces the risk of higher interest costs in periods of rising interest rates and increases our risk of paying higher interest costs in periods of decreasing interest rates 
following is a summary of the interest rate swaps rates for expired contracts are exclusive of an interest rate margin and active contracts are inclusive of the interest rate margin of applicable at december  under the credit agreement contract date notional amount interest period covered rate million million million million million million at december   the effective interest rate for the notional amounts covered by the swap agreements as of such date was inclusive of interest rate margin applicable at december  under the credit agreement 
as of september   as a result of repayment of the term loan facility  the interest rate swaps were de designated and no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment

pursuant to 
table of contents the terms of the notes  the principal amount of the convertible senior notes is settleable in cash and only the amount of conversion value  as defined  in excess of the principal amount of the notes is settleable in cash or shares 
the convertible senior notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants 
on or after may   the company may from time to time at its option redeem the convertible senior notes  in whole or in part  for cash  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes we redeem  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date 
on may   may  and may   holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of their convertible senior notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes to be purchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the purchase date 
effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for its convertible debt 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
this standard required the company to retrospectively adjust its and financial statements to change the previous accounting method for its million convertible senior notes see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
accordingly  the company recorded a million debt discount as additional paid in capital  as of the convertible senior notes issuance date of may  at december   the debt discount was million 
the company has million in principal due under the convertible debt  for a net carrying amount of million as of december  the company is amortizing the debt discount through the date at which the company can begin to redeem the convertible senior notes  which is may  the effective interest rate used to measure the fair value of the debt was  which was based on market conditions for nonconvertible debt at the time the debt was entered into 
the company recognized interest expense of million and million related to the convertible debt for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which million in each year is based on the coupon rate 
contractual obligations the company s significant contractual obligations or commercial commitments consist of the company s operating and capital leases for office facilities and equipment  long term debt  pension plan obligation and purchase obligations 
as of december   future payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments are as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating and capital lease obligations  net of sublease income long term debt estimated interest payments pension benefit payments purchase obligations total contractual obligations due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
in addition  due to uncertainty of future interest rates  million of interest rate swap liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and that the ultimate payments associated with these commitments will not have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity position 

table of contents foreign currency risk the company has several operations in foreign locations around the world 
these operations incur revenue and expenses in various foreign currencies 
revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar expose the company to foreign currency market risk 
unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates between the united states dollar and other foreign currencies may have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
these foreign currency market movements could create a foreign currency gain or loss that could be realized or unrealized for the company 
the company s board of directors has approved a foreign currency risk policy that allows the company to enter into forward contracts and purchase option agreements to hedge foreign currency risks 
the company has an ongoing program to evaluate its foreign currency risk and to minimize these risks whenever possible through leading and lagging accounts payables and accounts receivables  centralized cash management and other forms of natural hedging 
the company also uses forward contracts or purchase options to hedge some of its foreign currency transaction exposure 
gains and losses resulting from these transactions are included in interest and other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the company had no open forward contracts or purchase options 
the company conducts limited operations in venezuela eg  revenue derived from venezuelan operations represented less than of the company s consolidated revenue for the year ended december  
in january  the government of venezuela devalued its bolivar currency from to bolivares per united states dollar 
as a result of the devaluation  the company expects its cash and working capital balances will be reduced by and will incur a foreign currency charge of approximately million due to the revaluing of its bolivar based assets during the first fiscal quarter of this estimate is based on the company s bolivar based assets at december  off balance sheet arrangements through december   the company has not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
based on the investment interest rate and the balance as of december   a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million on an annual basis to the extent the company s returns exceed  as well as a commensurate decrease in the company s net income and a decrease in cash flows from operations 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
deposits with its united states issuers may exceed the amounts of federal deposit insurance provided on such deposits  and deposits held outside the united states are not afforded such protection 
the company has approximately of its cash and cash equivalents outside the united states 
the company is averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company has not experienced any losses on deposits of cash or cash equivalents 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on its variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to the company at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above 
changes in interest rates do not affect the amount of interest we pay on our fixed rate senior convertible notes  but do affect the fair value of the debt 
interest under the company s credit facility is computed on a floating rate basis 
the credit facility required the company to enter into interest rate swap agreements to protect against fluctuations in the floating rate for a portion of the outstanding term loan balance for a period of time 
on april   march  and march  the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements that convert a portion of its floating rate interest rate exposure under the credit facility to a fixed rate basis 
at the time the company entered into the interest rate swaps  they qualified for hedge accounting treatment 
the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate swaps on the balance sheet 
as of september   the company de designated the swaps as a result of its repayment of the term loan under the credit facility  and the fair value changes are now recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap agreements is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as interest rates change 
at december   the interest rates swap arrangements hedged the floating rate interest risk on million of the million balance then outstanding under the credit facility 
accordingly  at december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million on the un hedged principal amount on an annual basis  as well as decrease the company s net income and decrease cash flows from operations 
foreign currency risk the company did not have any foreign currency forward or option contracts open as of december  international revenues represented of the company s total revenues for the year ended december   and of revenues were denominated in foreign currencies 
the company had an unrealized and realized transactional foreign currency loss for the year ended december  of million 
for the year ended december   the transactional gains and losses were primarily due to settlement of inter company balances and changes in value of certain cash and other net assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies
