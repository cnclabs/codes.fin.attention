item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered  application critical equipment and systems for the energy  industrial  chemical and pharmaceutical markets worldwide 
we attribute our success to our close and continuing interaction with customers  our manufacturing  sourcing and application engineering expertise and our ability to serve customers globally 
we attempt to continually develop initiatives to improve our performance in these key areas 
in late calendar year through mid calendar year  demand for most of our products slowed due to lower oil and natural gas prices as well as the worldwide economic downturn  which affected our operating results 
we responded to these challenging business conditions by cutting costs  initiating restructuring programs to reduce manufacturing capacity while increasing utilization  standardizing product offerings to allow greater utilization of our lower cost manufacturing facilities  leveraging functional resources  and further integrating our business activities 
we expect to continue our restructuring efforts into fiscal to improve our competitiveness and long term profitability 
in addition  we are continuing our focus on emerging markets where economic growth remains well above the global average  and we are committed to increasing margins through productivity initiatives  improved sales  product management and aftermarket capabilities  commercializing new products  increased utilization of global work force  reductions in discretionary spending and close management of fixed costs 
we operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets  and our long term growth will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business including through geographical and product line expansion  identify  consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions to create shareholder value  develop innovative new products with attractive gross profit margins and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness 
we are cautiously optimistic that worldwide economic recovery and recent market trends will continue to gain strength in fiscal  following four quarters of sequential growth in consolidated orders and an increase in consolidated backlog throughout fiscal our company has a venezuelan subsidiary with net sales  operating income and total assets representing approximately one percent of our consolidated financial statement amounts in fiscal and in early january  the venezuelan government devalued its currency 
we expect our subsidiary to operate under a rate of bolivars to the us dollar  as compared with the previous rate of  and our fiscal year end financial statements reflect this new rate 
in addition  the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary were consolidated and reported under highly inflationary accounting rules beginning in the second quarter of fiscal resulting in an income statement exchange loss of million during the year 
with approximately of our sales outside the united states  we were also impacted by foreign currency translation in fiscal due to the us dollar strengthening relative to our other principal operating currencies 
the impact on net income was immaterial for fiscal additionally  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  with related gains or losses reported as a separate component of our shareholders equity  except for venezuela as discussed above 
the devaluation of most foreign currencies against the us dollar impacted our financial condition at the end of fiscal as compared with fiscal on october   we announced an agreement to acquire t energy services  inc t  a provider of oilfield and pipeline products and services  in a transaction valued at approximately million as of the date of the announcement  net of cash assumed 
under the terms of the agreement  for each share of t common stock  t stockholders will receive of our common shares plus in cash without interest 
accordingly  t stockholders are estimated to receive an aggregate of approximately million of our common shares and million in cash  which we expect to pay from our available cash balances 
upon closing of the transaction  we expect t stockholders to own approximately of our outstanding common shares 
the proposed agreement see note subsequent events is expected to be completed in late calendar year or early calendar year subject to customary closing conditions  shareholder approvals and regulatory reviews and will operate under our fluid management segment 
our business consists of three market focused segments fluid management  process solutions and romaco 
beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  we realigned our business segment reporting structure as a result of organizational  management and operational changes implemented in the first quarter of fiscal our chemineer brand is now included in our fluid management segment  instead of the process solutions segment where it was previously reported 
certain amounts presented in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation and to reflect this segment realignment

consolidated sales cost of sales gross profit sg a expenses other expense income ebit by segment in millions  except percents fluid management sales ebit ebit process solutions sales ebit ebit romaco sales ebit ebit consolidated sales ebit ebit the comparability of the operating results has been impacted by restructuring costs in fiscal  as well as product line facility sale gains in fiscal see note  statement of income information  in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  the comparability of the segment data is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  due to the translation of non us dollar denominated subsidiary results into non us dollars 
the company s operating performance is evaluated using several measures 
one of those measures  ebit  is income before interest and income taxes and is reconciled to net income on our consolidated statement of income 
we evaluate performance of our business segments and allocate resources based on ebit 
ebit is not  however  a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating results 
ebit is not a measure of cash available for use by management 
fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  net sales consolidated sales for fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
excluding the impact of currency translation  sales decreased by million  or due to lower sales in all three of our segments in the first six months of fiscal sales in the second half of fiscal were higher than the comparable period of the prior year 
the fluid management segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  sales declined by million  or 
the year over year sales decrease was primarily due to lower customer demand early in fiscal 
table of contents resulting from reduced levels of oil and gas exploration and recovery activity in that period 
there was higher activity in the second half of fiscal over the same period in the prior year which was driven by higher oil prices worldwide  a higher level of demand for horizontal drilling rigs used in north american shale formations and higher general industrial activity 
orders for this segment were impacted by the same factors and were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal excluding the impact of foreign currency  orders grew million in fiscal over fiscal ending backlog of million was higher than at the end of the prior year 
the process solutions segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
excluding the impact of currency translation  sales decreased by million  or from results which benefited from significant backlog at the beginning of the fiscal year 
orders in fiscal  however  continued to improve from the latter half of fiscal to million reflecting improved market conditions 
excluding foreign currency impact  orders increased by million  or over prior year 
demand in our western chemical markets remained weak  while demand in our asian market was favorable 
ending backlog of million was higher than at the end of prior year 
the romaco segment  which is a european based business  had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
after adjusting for currency translation  sales decreased million  or from the prior year 
orders were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal excluding currency impact  orders increased million  or  from the prior year 
we believe this order increase is an outcome of the global economic recovery combined with our increased focus on market opportunities and product innovation 
ending backlog of million was lower than prior year levels 
earnings before interest and income taxes ebit consolidated ebit for fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
results for fiscal included other expense of million related to restructuring costs in our process solutions segment 
excluding the impacts of other expense and currency  consolidated ebit decreased million mainly due to lower sales volume described above in all of our segments  a million highly inflationary currency loss related to our venezuelan operations  european pricing pressures in our process solutions segment and higher corporate costs related to strategic and legal matters 
consistent with the sales variances described above  the unfavorable variances related primarily to the first six months of the fiscal year 
the fluid management segment ebit for fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal excluding the currency rate impact  ebit decreased million or due primarily to the sales decrease described above and the venezuelan highly inflationary currency loss  offset by an insurance recovery of million  an asset sale gain of million and favorable product mix 
the process solutions segment had an ebit loss of million in fiscal  compared with ebit of million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
excluding the impact of currency translation  ebit declined million 
this decrease is due principally to lower sales  restructuring costs of million and european pricing pressures in fiscal the romaco segment ebit was million for fiscal  an increase of million compared with fiscal currency translation did not materially impact ebit in this segment 
the increase in ebit  despite lower sales in fiscal compared with fiscal  resulted from operational streamlining  personnel reductions and other cost cutting measures 
corporate costs were million higher in fiscal over the prior year mainly due to costs associated with strategic and legal matters 
interest expense net interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the reduction in net interest expense resulted primarily from lower debt levels in fiscal due to the million repayment of all remaining senior notes on may  
table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the current year tax rate is slightly lower than the u 
s federal statutory rate mainly due to a one time tax planning gain and the closure of tax audits  somewhat offset by non us valuation allowances 
the lower fiscal tax rate resulted from a non recurring tax planning gain and finalizing earlier tax estimates that year 
net income our net income in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal the decrease in net income is a result of lower sales  pricing pressures in certain product lines  higher costs related to restructuring  legal and strategic matters and a higher tax rate  partly offset by cost reduction initiatives

currency translation accounted for million of the decrease  and the remaining million decrease  or  resulted from lower demand for energy equipment products and lower demand in general industrial markets 
orders for this segment were impacted by the same factors and were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal ending backlog of million was lower than at the end of the prior year 
the process solutions segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease million  or 
excluding the impact of currency translation  sales declined by million 
we believe this decrease was largely attributable to the worldwide economic downturn 
orders were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the drop in orders in fiscal over prior year was primarily driven by lower demand in our chemical markets 
ending backlog of million was lower than prior year levels 
the romaco segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
after adjusting for currency translation  sales decreased million  or from the prior year 
orders decreased million  or  from the prior year after adjusting for currency exchange rates 
we believe the decrease in demand was primarily due to the worldwide economic slowdown

results for fiscal included other income of million from gains on product line facility sales 
excluding the impact of other income  and a currency impact of million  consolidated ebit decreased million mainly due to decreased sales volume described above  pricing pressures in certain product lines  and higher general operating expenses related to severance  employee benefit plans and legal costs  partly offset by cost reduction initiatives completed during the year 
the fluid management segment ebit for fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the decrease of million  or million excluding currency translation  resulted primarily from the sales decrease in the second half of fiscal as described above and pricing pressures in certain product lines

process solutions had a gain on the sale of a facility in fiscal of million 
excluding the impact of the facility sale gain  and a currency effect of million  fiscal ebit decreased by million principally due to the lower sales volume described above  coupled with pricing pressures in certain product lines and severance costs 

table of contents the romaco segment ebit was million for fiscal  a decrease of million compared with fiscal in fiscal  other income included a million gain from romaco product lines divestiture in fiscal and a million gain on a facility sale related to a previously disposed product line 
the remaining million in lower earnings was due to decreased sales volume described above 
interest expense net interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the reduction in net interest expense resulted from lower debt levels in fiscal due to the repayment of million of senior notes on may  income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the lower tax rate resulted from the implementation of certain tax strategies and finalizing earlier tax estimates 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to profitable operations in italy and germany  which resulted in the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances of million as well as increased taxable income in countries outside the united states  where statutory rates are lower 
net income our net income in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal the decrease in net income was a result of lower sales  pricing pressures in certain product lines  severance costs related to our restructuring efforts across all our business platforms  benefit from product line asset sales in fiscal  higher medical and legal costs  partly offset by cost reduction initiatives  lower interest expense and a lower normalized effective tax rate in fiscal  as discussed above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash flow from operating activities was million compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million 
this increase from prior year  despite lower net income  resulted from a net reduction in working capital  which contributed million to fiscal cash flow 
we expect our available cash  fiscal operating cash flow and availability under our credit agreement to be adequate to fund fiscal year operating needs  shareholder dividends  capital expenditures  and additional share repurchases  if any 
investing activities in  the company continued to generate substantial cash from operating activities  which resulted in a strong year end financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses and acquisitions 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  a decrease from million in fiscal our capital expenditures were primarily for cost reduction  sales growth initiatives and replacement items 
capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be million or higher 
in fiscal  we received million related to the sale of certain of our assets at two of our business units 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased the remaining percent noncontrolling interest in our process solutions group chinese subsidiary for million  which we funded from available cash balances 
we made an acquisition in our process solutions segment in for a total consideration of million 
in fiscal we received proceeds of million related to the sale of two of our romaco product lines sold in fiscal and the sale of two facilities 
financing activities from available cash balances  we repaid the remaining million of senior notes on the may  maturity date 
proceeds from the sale of common stock were million in fiscal and million in fiscal and were primarily related to the exercise of stock options and employee benefit plan sales 
dividends paid during fiscal were million  compared with million in fiscal the quarterly dividend rate per common share was increased in january from to 
on october   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our currently outstanding common shares 
we acquired approximately million of our outstanding common shares for million under the repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal there were no such share repurchases in fiscal credit agreement our bank credit agreement agreement provides that we may borrow on a revolving credit basis up to a maximum of million and includes a million expansion feature 
all outstanding amounts under the agreement are due and payable on december  interest is variable based upon formulas tied to libor or an alternative base rate defined in the agreement  at our option  and is payable quarterly 
indebtedness under the agreement is unsecured except for the pledge of the stock of our us subsidiaries and approximately two thirds of the stock of certain non us subsidiaries 
at august  we had no borrowings under the agreement 
we had million of standby letters of credit outstanding at august  these standby letters of credit are primarily used as security for advance payments received from customers and for our performance under customer contracts 
under the agreement  we have million of unused borrowing capacity 
six banks participate in our revolving credit agreement 
we are not dependent on any single bank for our financing needs 
from available cash balances  we repaid the remaining million of senior notes on the may  maturity date 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer which is generally upon shipment of the product 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method because we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various stages of the contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty  litigation  product liability  tax contingencies  stock option valuation  goodwill valuation and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness  current economic trends within the industries we serve  specific customers ability to pay us and the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the demand for our products and the on hand quantities of inventory in relation to historical usage 
the inventory to which this reserve relates is still on hand and will be sold or disposed of in the future 
the expected selling price of this inventory approximates its net book value  therefore  there is no significant impact on gross margin when it is sold 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of the realization of tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets 
future taxable income  reversals of temporary differences  available carryback periods  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service and delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation and product liability reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated at our reporting unit level  were performed at year end for fiscal our annual impairment test date using both a market participant approach  as well as a discounted cash flow methodology income approach 
the market participant approach determines the value of a reporting unit by deriving market multiples for reporting units based on assumptions potential market participants would use in establishing a bid price for the unit 
this approach therefore assumes strategic initiatives will result in improvements in operational performance in the event of purchase  and includes the application of a discount rate based on market participant assumptions with respect to capital structure and access to capital markets 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of 
table of contents capital that reflects current and future market conditions 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
our final estimate of fair value of reporting units is developed by a combination of the fair values determined through both the market participant and income approaches 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
although our market participant assumptions and cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the market environment and plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in applying these assumptions to our valuations 
the impairment testing performed by the company at august  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  and  as such  no impairment existed 
our definite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis  with estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
these assets are evaluated periodically and when events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of these definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable  management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair values of these assets including discounted cash flow models  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests for goodwill and definite lived intangible assets would be reflected in income before interest and income taxes in our consolidated statement of income 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of non us dollar functional currency denominated financial statements into us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the consolidated balance sheet except venezuela  which was reported under highly inflationary accounting rules since our second quarter of fiscal  with all gains and losses from remeasurement reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
pension expense for fiscal and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in plan discount rates and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension expense 
a significant factor in determining the amount of expense recorded for a funded pension plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in plan assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
at august   the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets was 
in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at 
table of contents august   the weighted average discount rate used to value plan liabilities was 
we determine our discount rate based on an actuarial yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to fiscal specifically  a one half percent decrease in the rate of return on assets assumption would have the effect of increasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable increase in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one half percent increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by million  and a comparable decrease in the discount rate would have the opposite effect 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued and  in april  amended a new business combination standard codified within accounting standards codification asc  which changed the accounting for business acquisitions 
accounting for business combinations under this standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
this standard was effective for us on september  the standard had no immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements but could affect our financial position and results of operations depending on future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued a new standard which established the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests ncis in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries 
this standard requires all entities to report ncis previously reported as minority interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial statements  but separate from the parent shareholders equity 
this standard also requires any acquisitions or dispositions of ncis that do not result in a change of control to be accounted for as equity transactions 
further  it requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the standard was effective for us on september  provisions of this standard were applied to all ncis prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which were applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
as a result  upon adoption  we retroactively reclassified the minority interest balance reported in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet to a new component of equity with respect to ncis in consolidated subsidiaries 
the adoption of this standard also impacted certain captions identifying net income including nci and net income attributable to robbins myers  inc additional disclosures required by this standard are also included in the consolidated equity statement 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued an accounting standard which amended the list of factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of recognized intangible assets under asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the new standard applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets as well as intangible assets acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions 
under this standard  entities estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must consider the historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements  or  in the absence of historical experience  must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension 
this standard was effective for the company on september  and required certain additional disclosures included in note to our consolidated financial statements and application to useful life estimates prospectively for intangible assets acquired after august  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an accounting standard which provides additional guidance on employers disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans 
the disclosures required by the standard include a description of how investment allocation decisions are made  major categories of plan assets  and concentrations of risk within plan assets 
additionally  this standard requires disclosures similar to those required for fair value measurements and disclosures under asc with respect to fair value of plan assets  such as the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and information with respect to classification of plan assets in hierarchy of the source of information used to determine their value see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the disclosures under this standard are required for annual periods ending after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  that amends existing disclosure requirements under asc  by adding required disclosures about items transferring into and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy  adding separate disclosures about purchase  sales  issuances  and settlements relative to level measurements  and clarifying  among other things  the existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation 
this asu was effective for us in the fourth quarter of fiscal  except for the requirement to provide level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which is effective beginning our fiscal the adoption of this standard that was applicable for fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the remaining adoption of this standard in fiscal for level activity disclosure to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  which amends asc  subsequent events 
this asu  which was effective immediately  removes the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
we adopted this standard in the second quarter of fiscal the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 foreign currency issues multiple foreign currency exchange rates 
the asu was an announcement made by the staff of the us securities and exchange commission and provided the staff s view on certain foreign currency issues related to investments in venezuela 
the asu was effective as of the announcement date of march  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations following is information regarding our long term contractual obligations and other commitments outstanding as of august  payments due by period two to long term contractual one year three four to after five obligations total or less years five years years in thousands debt obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations operating leases consist primarily of building and equipment leases 
unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of  including interest and penalties  have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments 
the only other commercial commitments outstanding were standby letters of credit of  of this outstanding amount  is due within a year and  is due within two to three years 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain operations in the us and foreign countries 
we have market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates in the normal course of our business operations 
our significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
the company also operates in venezuela  whose currency in became highly inflationary  as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles  causing us to utilize the us dollar as the functional currency 
sales  operating income and total assets in venezuela represent less than of our consolidated financial statement amounts 
we continue to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions when needed 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our non us dollar net asset positions 
under certain conditions  we may enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
we currently do not have any such hedging transactions in place 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros  swiss francs and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us for fiscal  the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit for fiscal would have decreased by million and our cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
at august   our total debt of million had a weighted average variable interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our debt at august  approximates its carrying value due to the short period until maturity or the variable rate nature of the instruments
