item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
real estate secured loans 
our real estate loan classifications include loans secured by real estate which are made to purchase  construct or improve residential or commercial real estate  for real estate development purposes  and for various other commercial and consumer purposes whether or not those purposes are related to our real estate collateral 
commercial real estate and construction loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
in the case of commercial real estate loans  loan repayment may be dependent on the successful operation of income producing properties  a business  or a real estate project and  thus  may  to a greater extent than in the case of other loans  be subject to the risk of adverse conditions in the economy generally or in the real estate market in particular 
construction loans involve special risks due to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of houses or other improvements that are under construction and that are of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction 
for that reason  it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratios 
to minimize these risks  generally we limit loan amounts to of the projected appraised value of our collateral upon completion of construction 
many of our real estate loans  while secured by real estate  were made for purposes unrelated to the real estate collateral 
that generally is reflective of our efforts to minimize credit risk by taking real estate as primary or additional collateral  whenever possible  without regard to loan purpose 
all our real estate loans are secured by first or junior liens on real property  the majority of which is located in or near our banking market 
however  we have made loans  and have purchased participations in some loans from other entities  which are secured by real property located outside our banking market 
our real estate loans may be made at fixed or variable interest rates and  generally  with the exception of our long term residential mortgage loans discussed below  have maturities that do not exceed five years 
however  we also make real estate loans that have maturities of more than five years  or which are based on amortization schedules of as much as years  but that generally will include contractual provisions which allow us to call the loan in full  or provide for a balloon payment in full  at the end of no more than five to fifteen years 
in addition to residential real estate loans made for a variety of purposes  we offer long term  residential mortgage loans that are funded by and closed in the name of third party lenders 
this arrangement permits us to offer this product 
table of contents in our banking market and enhance our fee based income  but  by closing the loans in the names of the ultimate owners of those loans  we avoid the credit and interest rate risk associated with these long term loans 
however  on a limited basis  we also make residential mortgage loans that we retain in our own loan portfolio 
those loans typically are secured by first liens on the related residential property  are made at fixed and variable interest rates  and have maturities that do not exceed years  although we have a small number of residential mortgage loans in our portfolio with year maturities 
our home equity lines of credit include lines of credit that generally are used by borrowers for consumer purposes and are secured by first or junior liens on residential real property 
our commitment on each line is for a term of years  and interest is charged at a variable rate 
the terms of these lines of credit provide that borrowers either may pay accrued interest only  with the outstanding principal balances becoming due in full at the maturity of the lines  or they will make payments of principal and interest based on a year amortization schedule 
commercial loans 
our commercial loan classification includes loans to individuals and small and medium sized businesses for working capital  equipment purchases  and various other business and agricultural purposes  but that classification excludes any such loan that is secured by real estate 
these loans generally are secured by inventory  equipment or similar assets  but they also may be made on an unsecured basis 
in addition to loans which are classified on our books as commercial loans  as described above  many of our loans included within the real estate loan classification were made for commercial purposes but are classified as real estate loans on our books because they are secured by first or junior liens on real estate 
commercial loans may be made at variable or fixed rates of interest 
however  it is our policy that any loan which has a maturity or amortization schedule of longer than five years normally would be made at an interest rate that varies with our prime lending rate or would include contractual provisions which allow us to call the loan in full  or provide for a balloon payment in full  at the end of no more than five years 
commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from business cash flow  and those loans typically are secured by business assets  such as accounts receivable  equipment and inventory 
as a result  the ability of borrowers to repay commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of their businesses  and the collateral for commercial loans may depreciate over time and their values may not be as determinable relative to the time the loans were originated 
consumer loans 
our consumer loans consist primarily of loans for various consumer purposes  as well as the outstanding balances on non real estate secured consumer revolving credit accounts 
a majority of these loans are secured by liens on various personal assets of the borrowers  but they also may be made on an unsecured basis 
additionally  our real estate loans include loans secured by first or junior liens on real estate which were made for consumer purposes unrelated to the real estate collateral 
consumer loans generally are made at fixed interest rates and with maturities or amortization schedules which generally do not exceed five years 
however  consumer purpose loans secured by real estate and  thus  classified as real estate loans as described above may be made for terms of up to years  but under terms which allow us to call the loan in full  or provide for a balloon payment  at the end of no more than five to fifteen years 
consumer loans generally are secured by personal property and other personal assets of borrowers which often depreciate rapidly or are vulnerable to damage or loss 
in cases where damage or depreciation reduces the value of our collateral below the unpaid balance of a defaulted loan  repossession may not result in repayment of the entire outstanding loan balance 
the resulting deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower 
in connection with consumer lending in general  the success of our loan collection efforts are highly dependent on the continuing financial stability of our borrowers 
our collection capacity on consumer loans may be more likely to be adversely affected by a borrower s job loss  illness  personal bankruptcy or other change in personal circumstances than is the case with other types of loans 
loan administration and underwriting 
like most community banks  we make loans based to a great extent  on our assessment of borrowers income  cash flow  net worth  character and ability to repay the loan 
a principal risk associated with each loan category is the creditworthiness of our borrowers 
our loans may be viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is typically the case with some other types of loans  such as long term residential mortgage loans where greater emphasis is placed on assessed collateral values 
to manage risk  we have adopted written loan policies and procedures 
our loan portfolio is administered under a defined process that includes guidelines for loan underwriting standards  risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan risk grading  ongoing identification and management of 
table of contents credit deterioration  and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure 
these reviews also are used to test our compliance with our credit policies and procedures in an ongoing fashion 
the underwriting standards that we employ for loans include an evaluation of various factors  including but not limited to a loan applicant s income  cash flow  payment history on other debts and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations including payments on any proposed loan 
though creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration within the loan approval process  we take collateral particularly real estate whenever it s available 
this is done without regard to loan purpose 
in the case of secured loans  the underwriting process includes an analysis of the value of the proposed collateral 
the analysis is conducted in relation to the proposed loan amount 
consideration is given to the value of the collateral  the degree to which the value is ascertainable with any certainty  the marketability of the collateral in the event of default  and the likelihood of depreciation in the collateral value 
our board of directors has approved levels of lending authority for lending personnel based on our aggregate credit exposures to borrowers  along with the secured or unsecured status and the risk grade of a proposed loan 
a loan that satisfies our loan policies and is within a lending officer s assigned authority may be approved by that officer 
anything above that amount must be approved before funding by our credit administration management  the loan committee of the board of directors or our board of directors 
at the time a loan is proposed  the account officer assigns a risk grade to the loan based on various underwriting and other criteria 
the grades assigned to loans generally indicate the level of ongoing review and attention that we will give to those loans to protect our position 
after funding  all loans are reviewed by our loan administration personnel for adequacy of documentation and compliance with regulatory requirements 
most loans including the largest exposure loans are reviewed for compliance with our underwriting criteria and to reassess the grades assigned to them by the account officers 
during the life of each loan  its grade is reviewed and validated 
modifications can and are made to reflect changes in circumstances and risk 
loans generally are placed in a non accrual status if they become days past due unless  based on relevant circumstances  we believe that collateral is sufficient to justify continued accrual and the loan is in process of collection 
non accrual status is also applied whenever we believe that collection has become doubtful 
loans are charged off when the collection of principal and interest has become doubtful and the loans no longer can be considered a sound collectible asset or  in the case of unsecured loans  when they become days past due 
allowance for loan losses 
our board of directors loan committee reviews all substandard loans at least monthly  and our management meets regularly to review asset quality trends and to discuss loan policy issues 
based on these reviews and our current judgments about the credit quality of our loan portfolio and other relevant internal and external factors as well as historical charge off rates  we have established an allowance for loan losses 
the appropriateness of the allowance is assessed by our management  reviewed by the loan committee each month  and reviewed by the board of directors quarterly 
we make provisions to the allowance based on those assessments which are charged against our earnings

deposit activities our deposit products include business and individual checking accounts  savings accounts  now accounts  certificates of deposit and money market checking accounts 
we monitor our competition in order to keep the rates paid on our deposits at a competitive level 
the majority of our deposits are derived from within our banking market 
however  we have historically solicited and accepted wholesale deposits as a way to supplement funding to support loan growth and provide added balance sheet liquidity 
during  we engaged in a strategic effort to increase our core deposit accounts while decreasing our reliance on brokered deposits 
we initiated a money market special in july that guaranteed a special money market rate through june  for additional analysis of deposit relationships  see table vii

for additional information regarding appreciation and depreciation by security type  and information relating to other than temporary impairment  see note investment securities in our consolidated financial statements under item competition commercial banking in north carolina is highly competitive  due in large part to our state s early adoption of statewide branching 
over the years  federal and state legislation including the elimination of restrictions on interstate banking has heightened the competitive environment in which all financial institutions conduct their business  and the potential for competition among financial institutions of all types has increased significantly 
we compete with approximately commercial banks and institutions with offices in our banking market 
interest rates  both on loans and deposits  and prices of fee based services are significant competitive factors among financial institutions in general 
other important competitive factors include office location  office hours  the quality of customer service  community reputation  continuity of personnel and services  and  in the case of larger commercial customers  relative lending limits and the ability to offer sophisticated cash management and other commercial banking services 
many of our competitors have greater resources  broader geographic markets  more extensive branch networks  and higher lending limits than we do 
they also can offer more products and services and can better afford and make more effective use of media advertising  support services and electronic technology than we can 
in terms of assets  we are one of the smaller commercial banks in north carolina  and there is no assurance that we will be or continue to be an effective competitor in our banking market 
however  we believe that community banks can compete successfully by providing personalized service and making timely  local decisions  and that further consolidation in the banking industry is likely to create additional opportunities for community banks to capture deposits from affected customers who may become dissatisfied as their financial institutions grow larger 
additionally  we believe that the continued growth of our banking market affords an opportunity to capture new deposits from new residents 
substantially all of our customers are individuals and small and medium sized businesses 
we try to differentiate ourselves from our larger competitors with our focus on relationship banking  personalized service  direct customer contact  and our ability to make credit and other business decisions locally 
we also depend on our reputation as a community bank in our banking market  our involvement in the communities we serve  the experience of our senior management team  and the quality of our associates 
we believe that our focus allows us to be more responsive to our customers needs and more flexible in approving loans based on our personal knowledge of our customers 
employees on december   we had approximately full time equivalent employees including our executive officers 
we are not party to any collective bargaining agreement with our employees  and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
supervision and regulation our business and operations are subject to extensive federal and state governmental regulation and supervision 
the following is a summary of some of the basic statutes and regulations that apply to us  but it is not a complete discussion of all the laws that affect our business 
regulation of bank holding companies 
bank of the carolinas corporation is a north carolina business corporation that operates as a registered bank holding company under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhca 
we are subject to supervision and examination by  and the regulations and reporting 
table of contents requirements of  the federal reserve board the frb 
under the bhca  a bank holding company s activities are limited to banking  managing or controlling banks  or engaging in other activities the frb determines are closely related and a proper incident to banking or managing or controlling banks 
bank holding companies may elect to be regulated as financial holding companies if all their financial institution subsidiaries are and remain well capitalized and well managed as described in the frb s regulations and have a satisfactory record of compliance with the community reinvestment act 
in addition to the activities that are permissible for bank holding companies  financial holding companies are permitted to engage in additional activities that are determined by the frb  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity  or that are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions  or the financial system generally  as determined by the frb 
the bhca prohibits a bank holding company or financial holding company from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the outstanding voting stock  or substantially all of the assets  of any financial institution  or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company or savings bank holding company  without the prior approval of or  under specified circumstances  notice to  the frb 
additionally  the bhca generally prohibits banks or financial holding companies from acquiring ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting stock of any company that engages in an activity other than one that is permissible for the holding company 
in approving an application to engage in a nonbanking activity  the frb must consider whether that activity can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public  such as greater convenience  increased competition  or gains in efficiency  that outweigh possible adverse effects  such as undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices 
the law imposes a number of obligations and restrictions on a bank holding company and its insured bank subsidiaries designed to minimize potential losses to depositors and the fdic insurance funds 
for example  if a bank holding company s insured bank subsidiary becomes undercapitalized  the bank holding company is required to guarantee the bank s compliance subject to certain limits with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed with its federal banking agency 
a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those banks in circumstances in which  absent that policy  it might not do so 
under the bhca  the frb may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary if the frb determines that the activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of a bank subsidiary of a bank holding company 
regulation of the bank 
the bank is an insured  north carolina chartered bank 
its deposits are insured under the fdic s deposit insurance fund dif  and it is subject to supervision and examination by  and the regulations and reporting requirements of  the fdic and the north carolina commissioner of banks the commissioner 
the fdic and the commissioner are its primary federal and state banking regulators 
the bank is not a member bank of the federal reserve system 
as an insured bank  the bank is prohibited from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for national banks unless the fdic determines that the activity or investment would not pose a significant risk to the dif  and the bank is  and continues to be  in compliance with the capital standards that apply to it 
the bank also is prohibited from directly acquiring or retaining any equity investment of a type or in an amount that is not permitted for national banks 
the fdic and the commissioner regulate all areas of the bank s business  including its reserves  mergers  payment of dividends and other aspects of its operations 
they conduct regular examinations of the bank  and the bank must furnish periodic reports to the fdic and the commissioner containing detailed financial and other information about its affairs 
the fdic and the commissioner have broad powers to enforce laws and regulations that apply to the bank and to require the bank to correct conditions that affect its safety and soundness 
among others  these powers include issuing cease and desist orders  imposing civil penalties  and removing officers and directors  and their ability otherwise to intervene in the bank s operation if their examinations of the bank  or the reports it files  reflect a need for them to do so 
the bank s business also is influenced by prevailing economic conditions and governmental policies  both foreign and domestic  and  though it is not a member bank of the federal reserve system  by the monetary and fiscal policies of the 
table of contents frb 
the frb s actions and policy directives determine to a significant degree the cost and availability of funds the bank obtains from money market sources for lending and investing  and they also influence  directly and indirectly  the rates of interest the bank pays on time and savings deposits and the rates it charges on commercial bank loans 
powers of the fdic in connection with the insolvency of an insured depository institution 
under the federal deposit insurance act the fdia  if any insured depository institution becomes insolvent and the fdic is appointed as its conservator or receiver  the fdic may disaffirm or repudiate any contract or lease to which the institution is a party which it determines to be burdensome  and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined to promote the orderly administration of the institution s affairs 
the disaffirmance or repudiation of any of our obligations would result in a claim of the holder of that obligation against the conservatorship or receivership 
the amount paid on that claim would depend upon  among other factors  the amount of conservatorship or receivership assets available for the payment of unsecured claims and the priority of the claim relative to the priority of other unsecured creditors and depositors 
in its resolution of the problems of an insured depository institution in default or in danger of default  the fdic generally is required to satisfy its obligations to insured depositors at the least possible cost to the deposit insurance funds 
in addition  the fdic may not take any action that would have the effect of increasing the losses to the deposit insurance funds by protecting depositors for more than the insured portion of deposits or creditors other than depositors 
the fdia authorizes the fdic to settle all uninsured and unsecured claims in the insolvency of an insured bank by making a final settlement payment after the declaration of insolvency as full payment and disposition of the fdic s obligations to claimants 
the rate of the final settlement payments will be a percentage rate determined by the fdic reflecting an average of the fdic s receivership recovery experience 
gramm leach bliley act 
the federal gramm leach bliley act enacted in the glb act dramatically changed various federal laws governing the banking  securities and insurance industries 
the glb act permitted bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and  in general expanded opportunities to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies  overrode certain state laws that would prohibit certain banking and insurance affiliations  expanded the activities in which banks and bank holding companies may participate  required that banks and bank holding companies engage in some activities only through affiliates owned or managed in accordance with certain requirements  and reorganized responsibility among various federal regulators for oversight of certain securities activities conducted by banks and bank holding companies 
the glb act expanded opportunities for banks and bank holding companies to provide services and engage in other revenue generating activities that previously were prohibited to them 
however  while this expanded authority permits us to engage in additional activities  it also presents us with challenges as our larger competitors continue to expand their services and products into areas that are not feasible for smaller  community oriented financial institutions 
we have not elected to become a financial holding company 
payment of dividends 
under north carolina law  we are authorized to pay dividends as declared by our board of directors  provided that no such distribution results in our insolvency on a going concern or balance sheet basis 
however  although we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank  our principal source of funds with which we can pay dividends to our shareholders and pay our own obligations is dividends we receive from the bank 
for that reason  our ability to pay dividends effectively is subject to the same limitations that apply to the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the bank s payment of dividends to us 
our and the bank s board of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective banking regulators which are described in note to our audited financial statements included in item of this report 
among other things  the agreements require that we and the bank obtain the consent of our regulators before we may pay any cash dividends 
our sale of series a preferred stock to the us treasury during april under the tarp capital purchase program resulted in additional restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and to repurchase shares of our common stock 
unless all accrued dividends on the series a preferred stock have been paid in full  no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock  and we may not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock 
additionally  during the first three years following our sale of the series a preferred stock  we are required to obtain the consent of the us treasury in order to increase the dividend per share paid on our common stock from the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to our sale of the series a preferred stock  or to purchase 
table of contents outstanding shares of our common stock  unless the series a preferred stock has been redeemed in full or the us treasury has transferred all of the series a preferred stock to third parties 
under north carolina law  the bank may pay dividends only from its undivided profits 
however  if the bank s surplus is less than of its paid in capital stock  then the bank s directors may not declare any cash dividend until it has transferred from undivided profits to surplus of its undivided profits or any lesser percentage necessary to raise its surplus to an amount equal to of its paid in capital stock 
in addition to the restrictions described above  other state and federal statutory and regulatory restrictions apply to the bank s payment of cash dividends 
as an insured depository institution  federal law prohibits the bank from making any capital distributions  including the payment of a cash dividend if it is undercapitalized as that term is defined in the fdia or after making the distribution  would become undercapitalized 
if the fdic believes that we are engaged in  or about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice  the fdic may require  after notice and hearing  that we cease and desist from that practice 
the fdic has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the fdic has issued policy statements that provide that insured banks generally should pay dividends only from their current operating earnings  and  under the fdia  no dividend may be paid by an insured bank while it is in default on any assessment due the fdic 
the bank s payment of dividends also could be affected or limited by other factors  such as events or circumstances which lead the fdic to require as further described below that it maintain capital in excess of regulatory guidelines 
in the future  our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will be subject to our board of directors evaluation of our operating results  capital levels  financial condition  future growth plans  general business and economic conditions  and tax and other relevant considerations 
capital adequacy 
we and the bank are required to comply with the frb s and fdic s capital adequacy standards for bank holding companies and insured banks 
the frb and fdic has issued risk based capital and leverage capital guidelines for measuring capital adequacy  and all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for us or the bank to be considered in compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
under the fdic s risk based capital measure  the minimum ratio total capital ratio of the bank s total capital total capital to its risk weighted assets including various off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of total capital must be composed of tier capital 
tier capital includes common equity  undivided profits  minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and various other intangible assets 
the remainder of total capital may consist of tier capital which includes certain subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock  and a limited amount of loan loss reserves 
a bank or bank holding company that does not satisfy minimum capital requirements may be required to adopt and implement a plan acceptable to its federal banking regulator to achieve an adequate level of capital 
under the leverage capital measure  the minimum ratio leverage capital ratio of tier capital to average assets  less goodwill and various other intangible assets  generally is for entities that meet specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating 
all other entities generally are required to maintain an additional cushion of to basis points above the stated minimum 
the fdic s guidelines also provide that banks experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum levels without significant reliance on intangible assets  and a bank s tangible leverage ratio determined by deducting all intangible assets and other indicators of a bank s capital strength also are taken into consideration by banking regulators in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
our and the bank s board of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective banking regulators which are described in note to our audited financial statements included in item of this report 
among other things  the agreements require that the bank maintain capital levels in excess of normal statutory minimums  including a leverage capital ratio of not less than  and other ratios at least at well capitalized levels 
the frb and fdic also consider interest rate risk arising when the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off balance sheet position in the evaluation of the bank s capital adequacy 

table of contents banks with excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to hold additional amounts of capital against their exposure to losses resulting from that risk 
the regulators also require banks to incorporate market risk components into their risk based capital 
under these market risk requirements  capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a bank s trading activities 
our capital categories are determined solely for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective action rules described below and they are not necessarily an accurate representation of our overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes 
a failure to meet the capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement actions under those rules  including the issuance of a capital directive  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  a prohibition on the taking of brokered deposits  and other restrictions on our business 
as described below  the fdic also can impose other substantial restrictions on banks that fail to meet applicable capital requirements 
regulatory guidance on cre lending concentrations 
during  the fdic and other federal banking regulators issued guidance for sound risk management for financial institutions whose loan portfolios are deemed to have significant concentrations in commercial real estate cre 
in march  the fdic and other federal banking regulators issued further guidance on applying these principles in the current real estate lending environment  and they noted particular concern about construction and development loans 
the banking regulators have indicated that this guidance does not set strict limitations on the amount or percentage of cre within any given loan portfolio  and that they also will examine risk indicators in banks which have amounts or percentages of cre below the thresholds 
however  if a bank s cre exceeds these thresholds or if other risk indicators are present  the fdic and other federal banking regulators may require additional reporting and analysis to document management s evaluation of the potential additional risks of such concentration and the impact of any mitigating factors 
the march supplementary guidance stated that banks with significant cre concentrations should maintain or implement processes to increase and maintain strong capital levels  ensure that their loan loss allowances are appropriately strong  closely manage their cre and construction and development loan portfolios  maintain updated financial and analytical information about borrowers and guarantors  and bolster their workout infrastructure for problem loans 
it is possible that regulatory constraints associated with this guidance could adversely affect our ability to grow cre assets  and they also could increase the costs of monitoring and managing this component of our loan portfolio 
prompt corrective action 
federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized banks 
under this system  the fdic has established five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized and is required to take various mandatory supervisory actions  and is authorized to take other discretionary actions  with respect to banks in the three undercapitalized categories 
the severity of any such actions taken will depend upon the capital category in which a bank is placed 
generally  subject to a narrow exception  current federal law requires the fdic to appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank that is critically undercapitalized 
under the fdic s prompt corrective action rules  a bank that has a total capital ratio of or greater  a tier capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any written agreement  order  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive issued by the fdic  is considered to be well capitalized 
a bank with a total capital ratio of or greater  a tier capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater  is considered to be adequately capitalized 
a bank that has a total capital ratio of less than  a tier capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  is considered to be undercapitalized 
a bank that has a total capital ratio of less than  a tier capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  is considered to be significantly undercapitalized  and a bank that has a tangible equity capital to assets ratio equal to or less than is deemed to be critically undercapitalized 
for purposes of these rules  the term tangible equity includes core capital elements counted as tier capital for purposes of the risk based capital standards  plus the amount of outstanding cumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus  minus all intangible assets with various exceptions 
a bank may be considered to be in a capitalization category lower than indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating 
a bank that becomes undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized  is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the fdic 
an undercapitalized bank also is generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets  making acquisitions  establishing new branches  or engaging in any new line of business  except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the fdic 
also  the fdic may 
table of contents treat an undercapitalized bank as being significantly undercapitalized if it determines that those actions are necessary to carry out the purpose of the law 
the following table lists our and the bank s capital ratios at december  minimum required ratios required ratios to be considered well capitalized the company s capital ratios the bank s capital ratios leverage capital ratio tier capital to fourth quarter average assets tier capital ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital ratio total capital to risk weighted assets us treasury s troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program 
on april   we issued series a preferred stock in the amount of million and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock to the us treasury as a participant in the tarp capital purchase program 
the series a preferred stock qualifies as tier capital for purposes of regulatory capital requirements and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
unless all accrued dividends on the series a preferred stock have been paid in full  no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock  and we may not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock 
additionally  during the first three years following our sale of the series a preferred stock  we are required to obtain the consent of the us treasury in order to increase the dividend per share paid on our common stock from the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to our sale of the series a preferred stock  or to purchase outstanding shares of our common stock  unless we have redeemed all of this preferred stock or the us treasury has transferred all of this preferred stock to a third party 
in addition  until the us treasury ceases to own our securities sold under the tarp capital purchase program  the compensation arrangements for our senior executive officers must comply in all respects with the us emergency economic stabilization act of  as amended by the american recovery and reinvestment act of  and the rules and regulations there under 
reserve requirements 
under the frb s regulations  all fdic insured depository institutions must maintain average daily reserves against their transaction accounts 
no reserves are required to be maintained on the first million of transaction accounts  but reserves equal to must be maintained on the aggregate balances of those accounts between million and million  and reserves equal to must be maintained on aggregate balances in excess of million 
the frb may adjust these percentages from time to time 
because the bank s reserves are required to be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a federal reserve bank or with a qualified correspondent bank  one effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of our assets that are available for lending and other investment activities 
federal deposit insurance reform 
the bank s deposits are insured by the fdic to the full extent provided in the federal deposit insurance act  and the bank pays assessments to the fdic for that insurance coverage 
under the act  the fdic may terminate the bank s deposit insurance if it finds that the bank has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated applicable laws  regulations  rules or orders 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of fdira  as implemented through rules adopted by the fdic  has changed the federal deposit insurance system by  among other things merging the bank insurance fund and savings association insurance fund into a new deposit insurance fund the dif  raising the level of federal deposit insurance coverage for retirement accounts to  establishing a range of to within which the fdic must set and maintain the required reserve ratio for the dif  
table of contents requiring that  if the dif reserve ratio falls  or within six months is expected to fall  below the statutorily required minimum of  the fdic must adopt a restoration plan that provides for the dif to be restored  and eliminating restrictions on premium rates based on the dif reserve ratio  and giving the fdic discretion to price deposit insurance according to the risk posed to the dif by each insured institution  regardless of the dif reserve ratio 
the emergency economic stabilization act of temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage for all accounts from  to  per depositor 
the act provided that the basic deposit insurance limit would return to  on december  however  during may  that increased coverage was extended until december   at which time it will return to  for all accounts other than retirement accounts for which fdira permanently increased the basic coverage to  fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program 
during  the fdic implemented its temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp which applies to all us depository institutions insured by the fdic and all us bank holding companies  unless they have opted out of the tlgp or the fdic has terminated their participation 
under the tlgp  the fdic guarantees certain senior unsecured debt and or non interest bearing transaction account deposits  and in return for those guarantees the fdic is paid a fee based on the amount of the deposit or the money and maturity of the debt 
under the debt guarantee component of the tlgp  the fdic will pay the unpaid principal and interest on an fdic guaranteed debt instrument upon the uncured failure of the participating entity to make a timely payment of principal or interest in accordance with the terms of the instrument 
under the original terms of the transaction account guarantee component of the tlgp  all non interest bearing transaction accounts would be insured in full by the fdic until december   regardless of the standard maximum deposit insurance amount 
during august  the fdic extended the transaction account guarantee component of the tlgp through june  the bank has elected to participate in the non interest bearing transaction account guarantee program  but not the debt guarantee program 
in return for the expanded insurance coverage  the bank is paying an additional annual assessment surcharge equal to basis points that applies to the balances of non interest bearing transaction accounts in excess of the current standard deposit insurance coverage of  fdic insurance assessments 
under fdira  the fdic uses a revised risk based assessment system to determine the amount of the bank s deposit insurance assessment based on an evaluation of the probability that the deposit insurance fund will incur a loss with respect to the bank 
that evaluation takes into consideration risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of the bank s assets and liabilities and any other factors the fdic considers to be relevant  including information obtained from the commissioner 
a higher assessment rate results in an increase in the assessments paid by the bank to the fdic for deposit insurance 
the fdic is responsible for maintaining the adequacy of the dif  and the amount the bank pays for deposit insurance is influenced not only by the assessment of the risk it poses to the dif  but also by the adequacy of the insurance fund at any time to cover the risk posed by all insured institutions 
fdic insurance assessments could be increased substantially in the future if the fdic finds such an increase to be necessary in order to adequately maintain the insurance fund 
during  and because the dif reserve ratio had fallen below the minimum of mandated by fdira  the board of directors of the fdic adopted a restoration plan to return the reserve ratio to that minimum level as required by fdira within five years 
during february  the board amended its restoration plan to provide for the minimum dif reserve ratio to be restored within seven years and voted to impose a special assessment on insured institutions of basis points  and to increase regular assessment rates for however  during may  the special assessment was reduced to basis points on each insured institution s assets minus its tier capital as of june   but not more than basis points of the institution s assessment base for the second quarter of the special assessment was payable on september  during october  the fdic again amended its restoration plan to provide for the minimum dif reserve ratio to be restored within eight years  and adopted a uniform basis point increase in regular assessment rates effective 
table of contents january  during november  the fdic amended its regulations to require that insured institutions prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and on december  community reinvestment 
under the community reinvestment act the cra  an insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for banks  nor does it limit a bank s discretion to develop  consistent with the cra  the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
the cra requires the federal banking regulators  in connection with their examinations of insured banks  to assess the banks records of meeting the credit needs of their communities  using the ratings of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve  or substantial noncompliance  and to take that record into account in its evaluation of various applications by those banks 
all banks are required to publicly disclose their cra performance ratings 
the bank received a satisfactory rating in its last cra examination during july interstate banking and branching 
the bhca  as amended by the interstate banking provisions of the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking law  permits adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies to acquire control of the assets of banks in any state 
acquisitions are subject to antitrust provisions that cap at the portion of the total deposits of insured depository institutions in the united states that a single bank holding company may control  and generally cap at the portion of the total deposits of insured depository institutions in a state that a single bank holding company may control 
under certain circumstances  states have the authority to increase or decrease the cap  and states may set minimum age requirements of up to five years on target banks within their borders 
subject to certain conditions  the interstate banking law also permits interstate branching by allowing a bank in one state to merge with a bank located in a different state 
each state was allowed to opt out and thereby prohibit interstate branching by merger by enacting legislation to that effect 
the interstate banking law also permits banks to establish branches in other states by opening new branches or acquiring existing branches of other banks  provided the laws of those other states specifically permit that form of interstate branching 
north carolina has adopted statutes which  subject to conditions  authorize out of state bank holding companies and banks to acquire or merge with north carolina banks and to establish or acquire branches in north carolina 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates 
the bank is subject to the provisions of section a and b of the federal reserve act which restrict a bank s ability to enter into certain types of transactions with its affiliates  including its parent holding company or any subsidiaries of its parent company 
section a places limits on the amount of a bank s loans or extensions of credit to  or investment in  its affiliates  assets a bank may purchase from affiliates  except for real and personal property exempted by the frb  the amount of loans or extensions of credit by a bank to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the bank s affiliates  and a bank s guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of one of its affiliates 
transactions of the type described above are limited in amount  as to any one affiliate  to of a bank s capital and surplus and  as to all affiliates combined  to of a bank s capital and surplus 
in addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions  each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements 
the bank also must comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low quality assets from an affiliate 
among other things  section b prohibits a bank or its subsidiaries generally from engaging in transactions with its affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiaries  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
federal law also places restrictions on our ability to extend credit to our executive officers  directors  principal shareholders and their related interests 
these extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms

usa patriot act of the usa patriot act of is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the impact of the act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging 
the act contains sweeping anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations  including standards for verifying customer identification when accounts are opened  and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of is sweeping federal legislation that addressed accounting  corporate governance and disclosure issues 
the act applies to all public companies and imposed significant new requirements for public company governance and disclosure requirements 
some of the provisions of the act became effective immediately while others are still in the process of being implemented 
in general  the sarbanes oxley act mandated important new corporate governance and financial reporting requirements intended to enhance the accuracy and transparency of public companies reported financial results 
it established new responsibilities for corporate chief executive officers  chief financial officers and audit committees in the financial reporting process  and it created a new regulatory body to oversee auditors of public companies 
it backed these requirements with new sec enforcement tools  increased criminal penalties for federal mail  wire and securities fraud  and created new criminal penalties for document and record destruction in connection with federal investigations 
it also increased the opportunity for more private litigation by lengthening the statute of limitations for securities fraud claims and providing new federal corporate whistleblower protection 
the act also required that the various securities exchanges  including the nasdaq stock market  prohibit the listing of the stock of an issuer unless that issuer complies with various requirements relating to their audit committees and the independence of their directors that serve on those committees 
in response to the act  the exchanges themselves have imposed additional corporate governance requirements as conditions to the continued listing of an issuer s stock  including the requirement that various corporate matters including executive compensation and board nominations be approved  or recommended for approval by the issuer s full board of directors  by directors of the issuer who are independent as defined by the exchanges rules or by committees made up of independent directors 
we are subject to the requirements of the act and  because our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market  we are subject to the corporate governance requirements of the nasdaq stock market 
the economic and operational effects of the sarbanes oxley act on public companies  including us  have been and will continue to be significant in terms of the time  resources and costs associated with compliance 
because the act  for the most part  applies equally to larger and smaller public companies  we have been and will continue to be presented with additional challenges as a smaller  community oriented financial institution seeking to compete with larger financial institutions in our market

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
the following paragraphs describe material risks that could affect our business 
other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
risks relating to our business the current economic environment poses significant challenges for our business and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there has been significant disruption and volatility in the financial and capital markets since the financial services industry in particular has suffered unprecedented disruption  causing a number of institutions to fail or require government intervention to avoid failure 
these conditions were largely the result of the erosion of the us and global credit markets  including a significant and rapid deterioration in the mortgage lending and related real estate markets 
dramatic declines in the housing markets over the past three years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes  and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on the our borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
there can be no assurance that the economic conditions that have adversely affected the financial services industry  and the capital  credit and real estate markets generally  will improve significantly in the near term  in which case we could continue to experience losses  write downs of assets  further impairment charges of investment securities and capital and liquidity constraints or other business challenges 
a further deterioration in local economic conditions  particularly within our geographic regions and markets  could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses 
we may face the following risks in connection with these events economic conditions that negatively affect housing prices and the job market have resulted  and may continue to result  in deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolios  and such deterioration in credit quality has had  and could continue to have  a negative impact on our business 
market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities 
the processes we use to estimate allowance for loan losses and reserves may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future charge offs 
we expect to face increased regulation of our industry  and compliance with such regulation may increase our costs  limit our ability to pursue business opportunities  and increase compliance challenges 
as the above conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen  we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect our business and recent legislative and regulatory initiatives to address difficult market and economic conditions may not stabilize the us banking system 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by federal and state governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations 
banking regulations governing our operations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not security holders 
congress and federal regulatory 
table of contents agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
also  failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
these laws  rules and regulations  or any other laws  rules or regulations  that may be adopted in the future  could make compliance more difficult or expensive  restrict our ability to originate  broker or sell loans  further limit or restrict the amount of commissions  interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by the bank and otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition or prospects 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was signed into law 
eesa authorizes treasury to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to billion in mortgage loans  mortgage related securities and certain other financial instruments  including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies  under a troubled asset relief program  or tarp 
the purpose of tarp is to restore confidence and stability to the us banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other 
the treasury has allocated billion towards the tarp capital purchase program 
under that program  treasury is purchasing equity securities from participating institutions 
in february  the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was enacted containing additional provisions designed to support the national economy and aid in economic recovery 
the provisions of eesa and arra are in addition to numerous other actions by the federal reserve  treasury  the fdic  the sec and others to address the current decline in the national economy and liquidity and credit crisis that commenced in these measures include homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  emergency action against short selling practices  a temporary guaranty program for money market funds  the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers  and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector 
the purpose of eesa  arra and other recent legislative and regulatory actions is to support the national economy  stabilize the us banking system  and aid in economic recovery 
however  there is no assurance that eesa  arra and the other regulatory initiatives described above will be fully effective or have their desired effects 
if the volatility in the markets continues and economic conditions fail to improve or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented 
the capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption for more than two years 
as the volatility and disruption has continued  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for many issuers without regard to their underlying financial strength 
this has been particularly the case with respect to financial institutions  and the market prices of the stock of financial services companies in general  including ours  are at their lowest levels in recent history 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on our ability to access capital and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio 
lending money is a substantial part of our business 
every loan carries a degree of risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment 
this risk is affected by  among other things cash flow of the borrower and or a business activity being financed  in the case of a collateralized loan  changes in and uncertainties regarding future values of collateral  
table of contents the credit history of a particular borrower  changes in economic and industry conditions  and the duration of the loan 
we use underwriting procedures and criteria that we believe minimize the risk of loan delinquencies and losses  but banks routinely incur losses in their loan portfolios 
regardless of the underwriting criteria we use  we will experience loan losses from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  and some of those losses will result from factors beyond our control 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses 
however  we cannot be certain that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual loan losses we incur  and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
our allowance for loan losses is determined by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  plans for problem loan resolution  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  and industry information 
also included in management s estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events  the outcome of which are uncertain 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control  and these losses may exceed current estimates 
federal and north carolina regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review our loans and allowance for loan losses 
although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable losses  there are no assurances that future increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be needed or that regulators will not require us to increase its allowance 
either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our earnings and profitability 
we have experienced increases in the levels of non performing assets and loan charge offs in recent periods 
for additional information regarding loss experience  our allowance for loan losses and problem assets  see table ii 
summary of loss experience  table iii 
allocation of allowance for loan losses and table iv 
problem assets in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additional increases in our non performing assets or loan charge offs may require it to increase its allowance for loan losses  which would have an adverse effect upon our future results of operations 
a large percentage of our loans are secured by real estate 
adverse conditions in the real estate market in our banking markets might adversely affect on our loan portfolio 
while we do not have a sub prime lending program  a relatively large percentage of our loans are secured by real estate 
our management believes that  in the case of many of those loans  the real estate collateral is not being relied upon as the primary source of repayment  and the level of our real estate loans reflects  at least in part  our policy to take real estate whenever possible as primary or additional collateral rather than other types of collateral 
however  adverse conditions in the real estate market and the economy in general have decreased real estate values in our banking markets 
if the value of our collateral for a loan falls below the outstanding balance of that loan  our ability to collect the balance of the loan by selling the underlying real estate in the event of a default will be diminished  and we would be more likely to suffer a loss on the loan 
an increase in our loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the fdic recently adopted rules aimed at placing additional monitoring and management controls on financial institutions whose loan portfolios are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate cre 
at december   our loan portfolio was less than the two thresholds established by the fdic for cre concentrations and for additional regulatory scrutiny 
indications from regulators are that strict limitations on the amount or percentage of cre within any given portfolio are not expected  but  rather  that additional reporting and analysis will be required to document management s evaluation of the potential additional risks of such concentrations and the impact of any mitigating factors 
however  it is possible that regulatory constraints associated with these rules could adversely affect our ability to grow loan assets and thereby limit our overall growth 
these rules also could increase the costs of monitoring and managing this component of our loan portfolio 
either of these eventualities could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities  or on terms which are acceptable to us  could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally affect our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
among other sources of funds  we rely heavily on deposits for funds to make loans and provide for our other liquidity needs 
however  our loan demand has historically exceeded the rate at which we have been able to build core deposits  so we have relied heavily on interest sensitive deposits  including wholesale deposits  as sources of funds 
those deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and  in the future  depositors may not renew those deposits when they mature  or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to attract or retain them or to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources 
not being able to attract those deposits  or to retain or replace them as they mature  would adversely affect our liquidity 
paying higher deposit rates to attract  retain or replace those deposits could have a negative effect on our interest margin and operating results 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future in order to continue to grow  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
federal and state banking regulators require us to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
in addition  in the future we may need to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital 
in that regard  a number of financial institutions recently have sought to raise considerable amounts of capital in response to deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market  deteriorating economic conditions  declines in real estate values and other factors 
on december   our three capital ratios were above well capitalized levels under bank regulatory guidelines 
however  as described in note to our audited financial statements included in item of this report  our and the bank s boards of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective banking regulators which  among other things  require that the bank maintain capital levels in excess of the normal statutory minimums  including a leverage capital ratio of not less than  and other ratios at least at well capitalized levels 
if those agreed upon minimums are not met at the end of any quarter  the bank s board of directors is required to submit a plan to its banking regulators within days detailing how such minimums are to be met 
at december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  slightly below the minimum 
the tier leverage capital ratio is calculated based on the fourth quarter average of total assets  so the full effect of our strategy to reduce the size of the bank s balance sheet was not recognized for this purpose at year end 
if period end assets had been used to calculate the bank s tier leverage ratio at december  rather than fourth quarter average  the ratio would have been  higher than the level agreed to and above the ratio at which institutions are normally considered well capitalized 
based on average assets through march   we are confident that the tier leverage ratio will remain above for the first quarter of future growth in our earning assets resulting from internal expansion and new branch offices  at rates in excess of the rate at which our capital is increased through retained earnings  will reduce our capital ratios unless we continue to increase our capital 
also  future unexpected losses  whether resulting from loan losses or other causes  would reduce our capital 
should we need  or be required by regulatory authorities  to raise additional capital in the future to support our operations and growth  or if we seek to raise additional capital in order to redeem the preferred stock we have sold to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program  we may seek to do so through the issuance of  among other things  our common stock or preferred stock 
however  our ability to raise that additional capital will depend on conditions at that time in the capital markets  economic conditions  our financial performance and condition  and other factors  many of which are outside our control 
there is no assurance that  if needed  we will be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to us  may have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our operations  and on our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 

table of contents if we are unable to redeem the preferred stock we sold to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program after five years  the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially 
the dividend rate on the preferred stock we sold under the tarp capital purchase program will increase from per annum to per annum after five years 
depending on our financial condition at the time  this increase in the annual dividend rate could have a material negative effect on our liquidity and on our net income available to holders of our common stock 
higher fdic deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
the bank s fdic insurance premiums increased substantially in  and the company expects to pay significantly higher premiums in the future 
a large number of depository institution failures have significantly depleted the dif and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
in order to restore the dif to its statutorily mandated minimum of over a period of several years  the fdic increased deposit insurance premium rates at the beginning of and imposed a special assessment on june  the fdic may impose additional special assessments in the future 
our profitability is subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our profitability depends  to a large extent  on our net interest income  which is the difference between our income on interest earning assets and our expense on interest bearing deposits and other liabilities 
in other words  to be profitable  we have to earn more interest on our loans and investments than we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
like most financial institutions  we are affected by changes in general interest rate levels and by other economic factors beyond our control 
interest rate risk arises in part from the mismatch ie  the interest sensitivity gap between the dollar amounts of repricing or maturing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and is measured in terms of the ratio of the interest rate sensitivity gap to total assets 
when more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities will reprice or mature over a given time period  a bank is considered asset sensitive and has a positive gap 
when more liabilities than assets will reprice or mature over a given time period  a bank is considered liability sensitive and has a negative gap 
a liability sensitive position ie  a negative gap may generally enhance net interest income in a falling interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
an asset sensitive position ie  a positive gap may generally enhance net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling interest rate environment 
our ability to manage our gap position determines to a great extent our ability to operate profitably 
however  fluctuations in interest rates are not predictable or controllable  nor do specific asset and liability groups reprice at the same time or in the same magnitude as general changes in interest rates 
therefore  we cannot assure you we will be able to manage net interest income in a manner that will allow us to become or remain profitable 
on december   we had a negative one year cumulative interest sensitivity gap  which means that  during a one year period  our interest bearing liabilities generally would be expected to reprice at a faster rate than our interest earning assets 
our business depends on the condition of the local and regional economies where we operate 
we currently have offices only in one region of north carolina 
consistent with our community banking philosophy  a majority of our customers are located in and do business in that region  and we lend a substantial portion of our capital and deposits to commercial and consumer borrowers in our local banking markets 
therefore  our local and regional economy has a direct impact on our ability to generate deposits to support loan growth  the demand for loans  the ability of borrowers to repay loans  the value of collateral securing our loans particularly loans secured by real estate  and our ability to collect  liquidate and restructure problem loans 
if our local communities are adversely affected by current conditions in the national economy or by other specific events or trends  there could be a direct adverse effect on our operating results 
adverse economic conditions in our banking markets could reduce our growth rate  affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us  and generally affect our financial condition and operating results 
we are less able than larger institutions to spread risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies 

table of contents new or changes in existing tax  accounting  and regulatory rules and interpretations could have an adverse effect on our strategic initiatives  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit a financial company s shareholders 
these regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations  and our compliance with regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities  including payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions  investments  loans and interest rates charged  interest rates paid on deposits  and locations of offices 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described under item business supervision and regulation 
these regulations  along with the currently existing tax  accounting  securities  insurance  and monetary laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations  control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
the laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
as a result of recent turmoil in the financial services industry  it is likely that there will be an increase in the regulation of all financial institutions 
we cannot predict the effects of future changes on our business and profitability 
significant legal actions could subject us to substantial liabilities 
we are from time to time subject to claims related to our operations 
these claims and legal actions  including supervisory actions by our regulators  could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs 
as a result  we may be exposed to substantial liabilities  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
among the laws that apply to us  the usa patriot and bank secrecy acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities 
if such activities are detected  financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the treasury s office of financial crimes enforcement network 
these rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions 
several banking institutions have recently received large fines for non compliance with these laws and regulations 
although we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations  no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations 
competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability 
our future growth and success will depend on  among other things  our ability to compete effectively with other financial services providers in our banking markets 
to date  we have grown our business by focusing on our lines of business and emphasizing the high level of service and responsiveness desired by our customers 
however  commercial banking in our banking markets and in north carolina as a whole is extremely competitive 
we compete against commercial banks  credit unions  savings and loan associations  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market funds and other mutual funds  as well as other local and community  super regional  national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our market areas and elsewhere 
we compete with these institutions in attracting deposits and in making loans  and we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents 
our larger competitors have greater resources  broader geographic markets and name recognition  and higher lending limits than we do  and they can offer more products and services and better afford and more effectively use media advertising  support services and electronic technology than we can 
also  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do 
while we believe we compete effectively with other financial institutions  we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our size  lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread marketing costs across a broader market 
although we compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary markets with local advertisements  personal contacts and greater flexibility and responsiveness in working with local customers  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be an effective competitor in our banking markets 

table of contents we rely on dividends from the bank for substantially all of our revenue 
we receive substantially all of our revenue as dividends from the bank 
as described under the caption item business supervision and regulation  federal and state regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to us  and our and the bank s boards of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective banking regulators which require that we and the bank obtain the consent of our regulators before we may pay any cash dividends 
if the bank becomes unable to pay dividends to us  then we may not be able to service our debt  pay our other obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and on the preferred stock we sold to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
accordingly  our inability to receive dividends from the bank could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and the value of your investment in our common stock 
we depend on the services of our current management team 
our operating results and ability to adequately manage our growth and minimize loan losses are highly dependent on the services  managerial abilities and performance of our executive officers 
smaller banks  like us  sometimes find it more difficult to attract and retain experienced management personnel than larger banks 
we currently have an experienced management team that our board of directors believes is capable of managing and growing the bank 
however  changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks relating to our common stock the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive 
we cannot predict how or at what prices our common stock will trade in the future 
the market value of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following  most of which are beyond our control  as well as the other factors described in this risk factors section actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by financial analysts  actions of our current shareholders  including sales of common stock by existing shareholders and our directors and executive officers  fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  regulatory developments  and developments related to the financial services industry 
the market value of and trading in our common stock also is affected by conditions including price and trading fluctuations affecting the financial markets in general  and in the market for the stocks of financial services companies in particular 
these conditions may result in volatility in the market prices of stocks generally and  in turn  our common stock 
also  market conditions may result in sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market 
in each case  market conditions could affect the market price of our stock in a way that is unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance 
the trading volume in our common stock has been low  and the sale of a substantial number of shares in the public market could depress the price of our stock and make it difficult for you to sell your shares 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market  but it has a relatively low average daily trading volume relative to many other stocks 
thinly traded stock can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market  which can lead to significant price swings even when a relatively small number of shares are being traded and limit an investor s ability to quickly sell blocks of stock 
we cannot predict what effect future sales of our common stock in the market  or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale in the market  will have on the market price of our common stock 

table of contents our management beneficially owns a substantial percentage of our common stock  so our directors and executive officers can significantly affect voting results on matters voted on by our shareholders 
our current directors and executive officers  as a group  beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock 
because of their voting rights  in matters put to a vote of our shareholders it could be difficult for any group of our other shareholders to defeat a proposal favored by our management including the election of one or more of our directors or to approve a proposal opposed by management 
we participate in the tarp capital purchase program and there are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock 
the securities purchase agreement entered into with the us treasury generally provides that  for a period of three years  we may not  without the consent of treasury increase the cash dividend on our common stock  or subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock other than the preferred stock we sell to treasury or trust preferred securities 
in addition  we are unable to pay any dividends on our common stock unless we are current in our dividend payments on the preferred stock we sold to the us treasury 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant described in the next risk factor  could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
moreover  holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
we did not declare any dividends on our common stock in and we are not required to do so 
our board of directors likely will not restore our common stock dividend in the foreseeable future 
the preferred stock we sold to the us treasury affects net income available to our common shareholders and our earnings per common share  and the warrant we issued to treasury is dilutive to holders of our common stock 
the dividends we pay on the preferred stock sold to the us treasury reduces the net income available to our common shareholders and our earnings per common share 
the preferred stock also would receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up of our company 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant we issued to treasury in conjunction with the sale of preferred stock is exercised 
although treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of our common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant would not be bound by that restriction

under north carolina law  subject to certain restrictions  we are authorized to pay dividends as declared by our board of directors 
however  although we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank  our principal source of funds with which we can pay dividends to our shareholders and pay our own obligations is dividends we received from the bank 
for that reason  our ability to pay dividends effectively is subject to the same limitations that apply to the bank 
information regarding restrictions on our and the bank s ability to pay dividends is contained in item of this report under the caption payment of dividends 
in the future  any declaration and payment of cash dividends will be subject to the board of directors evaluation of our operating results  financial condition  future growth plans  general business and economic conditions  and tax and other relevant considerations 
also  the payment of cash dividends in the future will be subject to ongoing review by our banking regulators and to certain other legal and regulatory limitations including the requirement that our capital be maintained at certain minimum levels 
in that regard  our and the bank s boards of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective bank regulators described in note to our audited financial statements included in item of this report which require that we and the bank obtain the consent of our regulators before we may pay any cash dividends 
our sale of series a preferred stock to the us treasury during april under the tarp capital purchase program resulted in additional restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and to repurchase shares of our common stock 
unless all accrued dividends on the series a preferred stock have been paid in full  no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock  and we may not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock 
additionally  during the first three years following our sale of the series a preferred stock  we are required to obtain the consent of the us treasury in order to increase the dividend per share paid on our common stock from the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to our sale of the series a preferred stock  or to purchase outstanding shares of our common stock  unless the series a preferred stock has been redeemed in full or the us treasury has transferred all of the series a preferred stock to third parties 
there is no assurance that  in the future  we will have funds available to pay cash dividends  or  even if funds are available  that we will pay or the bank will be permitted to pay dividends in any particular amount or at any particular times  or that we will pay dividends at all

bank of the carolinas corporation the company is a north carolina chartered bank holding company that was incorporated on may   for the sole purpose of serving as the parent bank holding company for the bank 
the bank is an insured  north carolina chartered bank that began operations on december  because the company has no operations and conducts no business on its own other than owning bank of the carolinas the bank  the discussion contained in these footnotes concerns primarily the business of the bank 
however  for ease of reading and because the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  the company and its subsidiary are collectively referred to herein as the company unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the notes to our audited financial statements for the years ended december   and contain a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our policies with respect to methodology for the determination of our allowance for loan losses  and our asset impairment judgments  such as the recoverability of other real estate values  involve a higher degree of complexity and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
accordingly  we consider the policies related to those areas critical 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on generally accepted accounting principles  which require that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimatable and require that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  the present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market  and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to income 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which those loans  in our opinion  become uncollectible 
recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance 
the factors that influence our judgment in determining the amount charged against operating income include analyzing historical loan and lease losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  current assessment of problem loan administration  the results of regulatory examinations  and changes in the size  composition and risk assessment of the loan and lease portfolio 
also included in our estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events  the outcomes of which are uncertain 
these events may include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in overall interest rates  political conditions  legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which we conduct business 
the factors that are enumerated above form the basis for a model which we utilize in calculating the appropriate level of our allowance for loan losses at the balance sheet date 
this model has three main components 
first  losses are estimated on loans we have individually identified and determined to be impaired 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the loss allowance applicable to impaired loans is the difference  if any  between the loan balances outstanding and the value of the impaired loans as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from those borrowers discounted at the loan s effective rate  or in the case of collateral dependent loans  the fair value of the collateral securing those loans 
second  for all other loans  we divide the loan portfolio into groups or pools based on similarity of risk characteristics 
historical loss rates  which are weighted toward current experience  are then applied to determine an appropriate allowance for each pool or group 

table of contents finally  an adjustment is applied  if appropriate  to give effect to qualitative or environmental factors that could cause estimated credit losses within the existing loan portfolio to differ from the historical loss experience 
we review our allowance on a quarterly basis and believe that it is adequate to cover inherent loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
however  the appropriateness of the allowance using our procedures and methods is dependent upon the accuracy of various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that we will not  in any particular period  sustain loan losses that are significantly different from the amounts reserved for those loans  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio and our allowance  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require material changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their routine examination process  periodically review our allowance 
those agencies may require that we make additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
accounting for intangible assets is as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles 
we account for recognized intangible assets based on their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized  while intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to fair value impairment tests on at least an annual basis 
if based upon our evaluation impairment has occurred  the impairment charge is recognized at that time 
during the evaluation of our goodwill  the determination was made that our goodwill was impaired and the entire remaining balance of  was charged off our balance sheet 
overview the past two years have been difficult ones for the financial services industry in general 
bank failures have been numerous  particularly among community banks in some southeastern states  primarily brought about by the severe downturn in real estate markets 
our operating results over the past two years have been adversely affected by the weakness in the economy in general and real estate in particular 
our net loss available to common shareholders was million for and million for the losses in both years were driven by substantial increases in loan loss provisions due to deterioration in our loan portfolio  significant losses and net operating expenses associated with foreclosed real estate  as well as  lost interest revenue caused by elevated levels of nonperforming assets 
in addition to the effect on our operating results noted above  the economic environment of the past two years led to a decline of million in our loan portfolio during given the prominence of real estate loans in our lending activities  it has been and continues to be a challenge to generate quality credit in sufficient volume to outpace payments 
we strive to serve the financial needs of small to medium sized businesses and individuals in our market area  offering an array of financial products emphasizing superior customer service 
real estate secured loans  including construction loans and loans secured by existing commercial and residential properties  made up almost of our loan portfolio at december   with the remainder of our loans consisting of commercial and industrial loans and loans to individuals 
we also offer certain loan products through associations with various mortgage lending companies 
through these associations  we originate family residential mortgages  at both fixed and variable rates 
we earn fees for originating these loans and transferring the loan package to the mortgage lending companies 
the deposit services we offer include small business and personal checking accounts  savings accounts  money market checking accounts and certificates of deposit 
the company concentrates on providing customer service to build its customer deposit base and competes aggressively in the area of transaction accounts 
additional funding includes certificates of deposit acquired through deposit brokers  advances from the federal home loan bank  term repurchase agreements from two money center financial institutions and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks 
over of our revenue net interest income plus noninterest income was comprised of net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
therefore  the levels of interest rates and our ability to effectively manage the effect that changes in interest rates have on net interest income can have a significant impact on revenue and results of operations 
results of operations may also be 
table of contents materially affected by our provision for loan losses  which has been much higher during the past two years than our long term trend 
service charges and fee income generated from customer services represented less than of revenue in each of the past two years and represents an area of potential revenue growth 
noninterest expense is the third major driver of operating results along with net interest income and the provision for loan losses 
total noninterest expenses absorbed over of our revenue in each of the past two years 
noninterest expenses include compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  fdic insurance premiums  expenses related to foreclosed real estate  professional services  expenditures for data processing services and various other costs of doing business 
financial condition at december  and december  total assets at december   increased by million or to million compared to million at december  we had earning assets of million at december  consisting of million in loans  million in investment securities and million in temporary investments

total loans represented and of our total assets on december  and  respectively 
interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity and amount of the loan 
competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulation also influence interest rates 
on average  our loan portfolio yielded for the year ending december  as compared to an average yield of during we intend to continue to pursue growth of high quality loans to the extent permitted by our capital

held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost value and available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
we use our investment portfolio to employ liquid funds and as a tool in the management of interest rate risk  while at the same time providing interest income 
practically all of our securities are classified as available for sale and  as such  may be sold from time to time to increase liquidity or re balance the interest rate sensitivity profile of our balance sheet 
however  we do have the available liquidity to hold our securities to maturity should we have the need to 
in fact  we have classified some of our more illiquid securities as held to maturity because we fully intend to hold them until their maturity date 
all securities classified as held to maturity were purchased in and consist of subordinated debt and trust preferred securities issued or guaranteed by other financial institutions 
in december  we recorded an impairment charge of  on a million investment in a trust preferred security as a result of the guarantor exercising its right to defer interest payments to the issuing trust 
in addition to the impairment charge  we have discontinued recognizing interest income on this investment until such time as the guarantor resumes interest payments to the trust

during this same time period we had a decrease of million in savings and other customer time deposits 
this leads us to conclude that approximately million of the increase in money market deposits during the special promotion represented new deposits 
since the rate promotion expired we began to reduce the rates paid on money market deposits to levels more in line with the markets we serve and at december  money market deposits totaled million 
the year end combined balances in savings deposits  money market deposits and customer time deposits increased million  or  over the levels of june   shortly before the special promotion began

we had a net loss available to common shareholders of million or per share for the year ended december   compared to net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  and net income for the year ended december  of million  or 
per diluted common share 
as noted earlier  the principal reason for the losses incurred during the past two years has been related to deterioration in our loan portfolio which has resulted in materially higher loan loss provisions and increased expenses related to the ownership and disposal of foreclosed real estate 
net interest income 
our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated by our interest earning assets primarily loans and investment securities and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income increased million to million in from after declining million from our net interest margin remained stable in compared to at after declining from a margin of in our net interest spread improved to in from in which represented a substantial decline from the spread of 
the volatility in our net interest margin and net interest spread and resulting net interest income over the past two years has been primarily due to the declines in short term rates brought about by very aggressive federal reserve policies  slowing loan growth  increased levels of nonperforming assets and the effects of the special money market promotion discussed earlier 
while our net interest margin was identical with performance  net interest income  as noted above  increased million  or  in compared to also  the net interest margin in the third and fourth quarters of showed better 
table of contents relative improvement from the quarters than the full year results largely as the result of reducing rates on the money market deposits that were placed with us during our special promotion

the table also indicates that rates reduced the cost of interest bearing liabilities significantly more than they reduced the income from interest earning assets  which is reflective of the effect of reducing the rates on our money market deposits

provisions for loan losses are charged to income in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we deem appropriate under circumstances known to exist at the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the allowance for loan losses  we consider factors that include portfolio size  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current levels of impaired and delinquent loans  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of total loans was   and at december    and  respectively 
the allowance includes million at december  and million at december  allocated to specific loans with principal balances totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
see critical accounting policies 
the provision for loan losses decreased to million in from million in the provision was times the million provision recorded in and reflected the beginning of the current credit cycle  which has been particularly difficult for lenders with large concentrations of real estate loans 
the sizable provisions recorded in both and were the result of net charge offs and nonperforming asset levels that were significantly above long term historic trends on a relative basis 
net loan charge offs for totaled million which equates to of average loans for the year and a decline from net charge offs of million which represented of average loans outstanding for that year 
for the five years prior to the current credit cycle  our net charge offs averaged 
of average loans on an annual basis 
total nonperforming assets amounted to at december   an increase of from the year end total of million 
total nonperforming assets as a percent of loan related assets loans plus foreclosed real estate amounted to at december  compared to as of year end for the five year ends preceding the current credit cycle  nonperforming assets averaged of loan related assets 
nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets was of total assets at the end of compared to at december  on a historic basis  nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets averaged for the year ends 
noninterest income 
in addition to net interest income  we derive revenues from providing a variety of financial services to our customers 
fees from providing these services totaled million in  million in and million in the largest component of customer service fees is revenues from deposit services which totaled  
table of contents in   in and  in while this is a mature and very competitive part of our business  we believe this is an area of opportunity 
the fastest growing area of fee revenue is from debit card services 
while this is not a new service  it is still a relatively new part of the us payment system 
our revenues in this area almost doubled from  to  over the past two years 
fees from loan services  which primarily includes fees related to real estate loan production  declined in as real estate lending slowed 
a significant factor affecting our growth in overall customer service fees is our decision to exit the investment services business 
in  we collected  in revenue from facilitating the sale of packaged financial products to our customer base while only  in revenue was recorded in other significant components of noninterest income are gains and losses on investment securities and increase in the cash value of life insurance policies we hold on our officer level employees 
in  we realized million in net gains on investment securities 
this includes an other than temporary impairment charge of  on a million investment in the trust preferred securities as a result of the guarantor exercising its right to defer interest payments to the issuing trust

non interest expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or over the million reported for the year ended december   which was a million increase  or  from the amount 
the major factors contributing to the increase in noninterest expenses in compared to were an increase of million  or  in fdic insurance cost  as the result of the increased assessment rate  an increase of  or  in net operating costs and net losses on foreclosed real estate  reflecting higher levels of foreclosure activity  an increase of  or  in professional service expenditures  primarily the result of outsourcing certain credit administration functions and increased legal fees  an increase of  or  in occupancy and equipment expenses due primarily to new asset purchases and property taxes  and an increase of  or  in data processing costs as a result of a systems conversion 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in goodwill impairment charges of  due to the company s action to completely write off its unamortized goodwill in

we recorded income tax benefits of million in and million in and income tax expense of  in the income tax benefit amounted to of our pretax loss as compared to of pre tax loss for and the income tax expense amounted to of pre tax income for capital adequacy we are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic has issued risk based capital and leverage capital guidelines for measuring the adequacy of a bank s capital  and all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for us to be considered in compliance with the fdic s requirements 
on december   our total capital ratio and tier capital ratio were and  respectively  both well above the minimum levels required by the fdic s guidelines 
on december  our tier leverage capital ratio was  which was also well above the minimum level required by the fdic s guidelines 
however  the company and the bank s board of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective banking regulators which are described in note to our audited financial statements included in item of this report 
among other things  the agreements require that the bank maintain capital levels in excess of normal statutory minimums  including a tier leverage capital ratio of not less than  and other ratios at least at well capitalized levels 
at december   the bank s tier leverage capital ratio was  slightly below the agreed to minimum 
during the latter part of the bank implemented a deposit pricing strategy designed to improve net interest income and at the same time reduce the size of our balance sheet 
this strategy has been effective as total period end assets at december  declined million from september  the decline in assets was the principally the result of a million reduction in deposits  driven by declines in money market and brokered deposits 
the outflow in deposits was funded through reductions in liquid assets 
the tier leverage capital ratio is calculated based on the fourth quarter average of total assets  so the full effect of our balance sheet strategy was not recognized for this purpose at year end 
if period end assets had been used to calculate the bank s tier leverage ratio at december  rather than fourth quarter average  the ratio would have been  higher than the level agreed to and above the ratio at which institutions are normally considered well capitalized 
based on average assets through march   we are confident that the tier leverage ratio will remain above for the first quarter of 
table of contents liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity 
liquidity management is the process of managing assets and liabilities as well as their maturities to ensure adequate funding for loan and deposit activity as well as continued growth of the company 
sources of liquidity come from both balance sheet and off balance sheet sources 
we define balance sheet liquidity as the relationship that net liquid assets have to unsecured liabilities 
net liquid assets is the sum of cash and cash items  less required reserves on demand and now deposits  plus demand deposits due from banks  plus temporary investments  including federal funds sold  plus the fair value of investment securities  less collateral requirements related to public funds on deposit and repurchase agreements 
unsecured liabilities is equal to total liabilities less required cash reserves on noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest checking deposits and less the outstanding balances of all secured liabilities  whether secured by liquid assets or not 
we consider off balance sheet liquidity to include unsecured federal funds lines from other banks and loan collateral which may be used for additional advances from the federal home loan bank 
as of december  our balance sheet liquidity ratio net liquid assets as a percent of unsecured liabilities amounted to and our total liquidity ratio balance sheet plus off balance sheet liquidity was 
in addition  we have the ability to borrow million from the discount window of the federal reserve  as well as million from a correspondent bank  subject to our pledge of marketable securities  which could be used for temporary funding needs 
we also have the ability to borrow from the federal home loan bank on similar terms 
while we consider these arrangements sources of back up funding  we do not consider them as liquidity sources because they require our pledge of liquid assets as collateral 
we regularly borrow from the federal home loan bank as a normal part of our business 
these advances  which totaled million at december   are secured by various types of real estate secured loans 
the company closely monitors and evaluates its overall liquidity position 
the company believes its liquidity position at december  is adequate to meet its operating needs 
interest rate sensitivity 
our goal is to maintain a neutral interest rate sensitivity position whereby little or no change in interest income would occur as interest rates change 
on december   we were cumulatively liability sensitive for the next twelve months  which means that our interest bearing liabilities would reprice more quickly than our interest bearing assets 
theoretically  our net interest margin will decrease if market interest rates rise or increase if market interest rates fall 
however  the repricing characteristic of assets is different from the repricing characteristics of funding sources 
therefore  net interest income can be impacted by changes in interest rates even if the repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities are perfectly matched 
the following table shows the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet on december   but is not necessarily indicative of our position on other dates 
each category of assets and liabilities is shown with projected repricing and maturity dates 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets or liabilities 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
now accounts  savings accounts  and money market accounts are assumed to be subject to immediate repricing and depositor availability 
prepayment assumptions on mortgage loans and decay rates on deposit accounts have not been included in this analysis 
also  the table does not reflect scheduled principal repayments that will be received on loans 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities may vary substantially if different assumptions are used or if our actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions

table of contents effects of inflation and changing prices a commercial bank has an asset and liability structure that is distinctly different from that of a company with substantial investments in plant and inventory because the major portion of its assets is monetary in nature 
as a result  a bank s performance may be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates 
although the banking industry is more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation in the price of goods and services  inflation also is a factor that may influence interest rates 
yet  the frequency and magnitude of interest rate fluctuations do not necessarily coincide with changes in the general inflation rate 
inflation does affect our operating expense in that personnel expense and the cost of supplies and outside services tend to increase more during periods of high inflation
