item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a full service  global provider of seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing and interpretation services 
we believe that  taking into account the recent pgs onshore acquisition  we are the second largest provider of seismic data acquisition services in land  transition zone and shallow water environments based on total worldwide crew count 
our services are used by e p companies to identify and analyze drilling prospects  maximize drilling success  optimize field development and enhance production economics 
our management consistently monitors and assesses the risk factors and opportunities that may affect us 
more specifically  while demand for our services over the past year dropped significantly  we focused on the opportunities in international markets  and on obtaining better terms and conditions on contracts 
in addition  we entered into the multi client data business at the end of we have and will continue to aggressively compete for seismic projects from both existing and prospective customers 
in international markets  we have seen increasing demand from state owned national oil companies nocs and believe changing global dynamics relative to the oil and gas industry will result in increased opportunities with the nocs and given our existing relationships  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities 
we continue to focus on increasing our revenues and profitability by taking the following steps updating our technology and increasing our channel count per crew to allow us to compete for larger projects  which typically are more profitable  standardizing our equipment across our crews to allow us to move from country to country as conditions dictate and reduce crew downtime  lowering our general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues by reorganizing management and by increasing operational efficiencies  and invest in systems to standardize and automate processes 
global energy demand growth 
although demand for energy has recently declined  we believe that long term  global demand for energy will increase and as that demand rebounds  demand for seismic services from e p companies will also increase 
e p capital spending 
the need to replace depleting reserves should encourage capital expenditures by e p companies in exploration and production  which we expect will benefit the seismic services industry 
we believe that e p companies  including many national oil and gas companies  
table of contents remain under pressure to increase or replenish reserves and are looking to unconventional resource plays  transition zones  international locations and the optimization of current reserves with new technology to achieve these results 
seismic data acquisition services are a key component of e p companies capital expenditure programs 
technological development 
the application and utilization of seismic services have considerably increased over the last several years as a result of significant technological advancements  such as the move from d to d and single component to multi component seismic data recording and processing 
seismic services can now be applied to the entire sequence of exploration  development and production  as opposed to exploration only  allowing for a greater range of use for our services 
in addition  surveys previously shot d or single component are often being reshot with newer techniques to give greater clarity to the subsurface 
developments related to our business during and early include the following on december   we entered into an agreement to acquire the global onshore seismic business of petroleum geo services on december   we issued million  net of discount  of senior secured notes due on december   we issued  shares of common stock for approximately million  and restructured our series b preferred stock  on january   we issued  shares as part of the overallotment option to the underwriters of the december  stock issuance for approximately million 
on february   we consummated the acquisition of pgs onshore  refinanced our senior secured revolving credit facility and paid off substantially all our existing capital lease obligations 
as of december   our core operating business segments were seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing and interpretation 
our corporate activities include our general and administrative functions 
recent acquisitions we have completed one large acquisition in the last four years 
in addition  on february   we completed the pgs onshore acquisition 
grant acquisition on september   we acquired all of the capital stock of grant geophysical  inc  which added international seismic data acquisition services to our business  for million in cash 
the purchase of grant was funded from the proceeds of a million subordinated loan from avista and another institutional investor and a million senior loan from royal bank of canada  as administrative agent and lender  and avista in connection with this acquisition 
we used approximately million for the purchase of grant  million of proceeds from such loans to refinance existing indebtedness  approximately million for the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with such loans and the remainder for working capital 
the pgs onshore acquisition on december   we entered into a purchase agreement with petroleum geo services and its subsidiaries in which we agreed to purchase pgs onshore for million  consisting of million of cash and  shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment  primarily for 
table of contents changes in working capital 
in addition  we agreed to assume approximately million of current liabilities associated with the ordinary course operations of pgs onshore as specified in the purchase agreement 
under the purchase agreement  we agreed to purchase seven corporations or other entities owned by petroleum geo services or its subsidiaries  and to acquire assets and assume liabilities from four other subsidiaries of petroleum geo services 
the entities and assets acquired represent substantially all of pgs onshore 
we closed the acquisition on february   after obtaining any consents and approvals required under competition laws and satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
in connection with the acquisition of pgs onshore  we entered into a new million senior secured revolving credit facility 
see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources below 
results of operations summary of overall performance for during  we experienced significant revenue growth in international markets and overall offset by significant declines in activity levels in north america  both in data acquisition and processing 
the data acquisition segment experienced substantial earnings growth and continued to provide a strong base of earnings and cash flow for us 
the data processing and interpretation segment also contributed slightly reduced results 
the table below provides further analysis of our operating results and significant highlights by segment reporting unit area of operation segment reporting units area of operation significant highlights for north american seismic data acquisition revenue decrease of significant deterioration in demand and margins successful entrance into the multi client data library business international seismic data acquisition revenue growth of expansion of shallow water and transition zone acquisition capacity significant investments in new capacity data processing and interpretation revenue decrease of slight deterioration in demand  especially domestically continued advances in technology and capabilities we spent approximately million during in capital expenditures primarily for new vessels for our shallow water operations  new information systems  investments in surveying and drilling equipment for crews relocating from north america and maintenance capital expenditures 
results of operations for year ended december  compared to operating revenues 
revenues for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
this increase in revenue is attributable primarily to the company s international seismic data acquisition segment 
for the twelve months ended december   seismic data acquisition revenue totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
this increase in seismic data acquisition revenue is primarily attributable to investment in additional international crew capacity and continued strong demand for our services in niche markets such as obc and transition zone 
seismic data acquisition revenues for the twelve months ended december  includes million or from north america  and million or from international 
seismic data processing revenue totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period of  a decrease of due to decreased 
table of contents demand and increased price competition 
revenues include data library licensing revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and operating expenses 
operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of of the total operating expenses  seismic data acquisition operating expenses totaled million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million for the same period of while seismic data acquisition revenues increased by  data acquisition operating expenses remained the same due to the shift in job mix towards higher margin  international programs 
seismic data acquisition operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  includes million  or  from north america  and million  or from international 
seismic data processing operating expenses totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period of  a decrease of primarily due to lower activity levels 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily the result of salary expenses associated with increased personnel levels due to our overall growth  the strengthening of our infrastructure consisting primarily of information systems implementation costs  severance costs  and costs incurred related to the pgs onshore acquisition 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
this is primarily attributable to continued capital expenditures to support international crews along with the amortization of the multi client investment 
we incurred capital expenditures of million in as compared to million in amortization of multi client data for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense net of interest income for the twelve months ended december  increased by million or to million as compared to approximately million for the same period of this increase is primarily due to a million charge for a bridge commitment we obtained in connection with the signing of the purchase agreement to purchase pgs onshore 
income tax 
provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended december  was million  as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
the increase is mainly due to increased profitability in foreign jurisdictions and related withholding taxes 
the increase is mainly due to increased profitability in foreign jurisdictions  increased activity in deemed profit areas where taxes are calculated as a percentage of revenues and increased withholding taxes on the rental of our united states owned equipment to our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  the company recorded a million charge during for an uncertain tax position in one of its foreign operations ebitda and net loss 
ebitda as defined below increased to million for compared to million for this increase was due to increased international revenues and improved international margins  primarily as a result of a higher contribution from shallow water obc and transition zone projects 
we also had better crew utilization and less down time due to longer term contracts 
we had a loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to a loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in our net loss applicable to stockholders is primarily due to million of one time inducement 
table of contents payments to preferred shareholders  bridge loan fee  and acquisition costs related to the pgs onshore acquisition 
we define ebitda as net income loss the most directly generally accepted accounting principle or gaap financial measure before interest  taxes  other income expense including foreign exchange gains losses  gains losses on sale of equipment and insurance proceeds  warrant expense and other income expense  and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as used and defined by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income or loss  cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities  or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because this measure is widely used by investors in the energy industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors  helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure and asset base from its operating structure  and is used by our management for various purposes  including as a measure of operating performance  in presentations to our board of directors  as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting  and as a component for setting incentive compensation 
there are significant limitations to using ebitda as a measure of performance  including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non recurring items that materially affect our net income or loss  and the lack of comparability of results of operations of different companies 
see below for reconciliation from net income to common stockholders to ebitda for the year ended december in thousands net loss applicable to common stockholders preferred stock dividends and inducements paid to restructure preferred stock net income loss income tax expense interest expense  net other expense income as defined above depreciation and amortization ebitda update of credit metrics 
in  our credit metrics were significantly impacted as a result of several actions taken during the course of the year including increased revenues and ebitda significant changes in capital structure in preparation for the pgs onshore acquisition sale of  shares of common stock million senior secured notes these actions taken during successfully positioned us for the pgs onshore acquisition and to provide financial flexibility for future  focused growth

this increase in revenue is attributable primarily to our seismic data acquisition segment 
for the twelve months ended december   seismic data acquisition revenue totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
this increase in seismic data acquisition revenue is primarily attributable to improved contract terms  investment in additional crew capacity and continued strong demand for our services 
seismic data acquisition revenues for the twelve months ended december  includes million or from north america  and million or from international 
seismic data processing revenue totaled million at december  as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of due to increased demand for processing of seismic data combined with increased marketing efforts 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
this increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to our seismic data acquisition segment 
seismic data acquisition operating expenses totaled million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
increased operating expenses at our seismic data acquisition segment are primarily the result of increased seismic data acquisition activity 
seismic data acquisition operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  includes million  or  from north america  and million  or from international 
seismic data processing operating expenses totaled million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million for the same period of  a decrease of primarily due to cost reduction efforts implemented in late and improved productivity of existing resources 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily the result of salary expenses associated with increased personnel levels due to our overall growth  information systems implementation costs and increased bonus accruals due to higher activity levels under our incentive plans 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
this is primarily attributable to depreciation expense associated with high levels of capital expenditures in the second half of and all of we incurred capital expenditures of million in as compared to million in our capital expenditures in included additional recording capacity internationally  expansion of our shallow water operations and investments in new information systems 
interest expense 
interest expense net of interest income for the twelve months ended december  decreased by million or to million as compared to approximately million for the same period of this decrease is primarily due to the elimination of interest incurred on our floating rate notes  which were issued in december and redeemed in june in addition  we recorded a million loss on the redemption of the floating rate notes which consisted of a million premium and recognition of million of unamortized finance costs in income tax 
provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended december  was million  as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
the increase is mainly due to increased profitability in foreign jurisdictions and related withholding taxes and decreased profitability in the us 
table of contents ebitda and net loss 
ebitda increased to million for compared to million for we had a loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the same period of the decrease in our loss applicable to common stockholders of million is primarily due to decreased interest expense  loss on the redemption of the notes and one time severance and reorganization costs in and improved operations in see below for reconciliation from net loss applicable to common stockholders to ebitda for the year ended december in thousands net loss applicable to common stockholders preferred stock dividends net income loss income tax expense interest expense  net other expense income as defined above depreciation and amortization ebitda inflation and price changes we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations during the most recent three years 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate in certain countries where we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
as the majority of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  when possible  we mitigate this risk by entering into split dollar contracts 
under a split dollar contract  each client invoice is split into a local currency payment and a us dollar payment 
the local currency payment is collected locally and used to fund local expenditures  while the us dollar payment is made directly to a us dollar denominated bank account 
this reduces our exposure to foreign currency risks 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash have been cash flow generated by our seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing segments  debt and equity transactions  equipment financing and trade credit 
our primary uses of cash have been for operating expenses associated with our seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing segments  capital expenditures associated with upgrading and expanding our capital asset base and debt service 
as of december   we had available liquidity as follows total borrowing capacity under revolving credit facility million available cash million undrawn borrowing capacity under revolving credit facility million net available liquidity at december  million as of december   we also had approximately million in restricted cash primarily to repay our existing revolving credit facility and substantially all of our capital lease obligations and to pay the cash portion of the pgs onshore acquisition 

table of contents we have certain foreign overdraft facilities in the amount of million which were undrawn at december  however  due to limitations on the ability to remit funds to the united states  these have been excluded in the available liquidity table above 
the table below summarizes certain measures of liquidity and capital expenditures  as well as our sources of capital from internal and external sources  for the past three years 
financial measure in thousands cash and equivalents  at december working capital  at december cash flow from operating activities cash flow used in investing activities cash flow from financing activities capital expenditures including capital leases cash paid for interest net cash provided by operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the twelve months ended december  these amounts result from our operating results adjusted by changes in working capital and depreciation 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher activity levels and improved operating results 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december  and million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to approximately million which was deposited into escrow accounts for the pgs onshore acquisition 
other amounts primarily represent capital expenditures and investment in multi client data library made during the respective twelve month period 
during the twelve months ended december  we also had reduced purchases of seismic data acquisition equipment from net cash provided by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the twelve months ended december  these totals represent the net proceeds and net payments from our debt and equity transactions 
preferred stock in december  we issued series b preferred stock to affiliates of avista capital partners lp and another institutional investor  and in july  we issued shares of series b preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to avista 
in connection with the pgs onshore acquisition and the common stock offering  on december   we restructured the series b preferred stock to reduce the conversion price from to  to increase the dividend of the series b preferred stock to  to extend the dates on which we may pay interest in kind and after which we are required to redeem the series b preferred stock until one year after the maturity date of the notes  and to waive certain other provisions of the series b preferred stock to facilitate the acquisition 
we agreed to pay avista capital holdings  lp and levant america sa a fee of million  which was of the liquidation amount of the preferred stock 
additionally  we agreed to exchange the series b preferred stock for a new series of preferred stock  series c  plus the issuance of  shares of our common stock and a fee of million  which was of the liquidation value of the preferred stock 
the new preferred stock is not convertible  and has a dividend rate of and an aggregate liquidation amount of million 
we will have the ability to pay dividends on the new preferred stock in kind or allow them to accrue 
table of contents without being paid  and will not be required to redeem the new preferred stock for the liquidation amount  until one year after the maturity of the notes  december  the new series of preferred stock will be considered a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument that is within the scope of asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity and therefore will be classified a long term liability 
the dividends payable on the new series of preferred stock will be classified as interest expense 
senior secured notes due on december   one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  geokinetics holdings  usa  inc  issued million senior secured notes due the notes in a private placement to institutional buyers at an issue price of of the principal amount or approximately million 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  with interest payments commencing in june the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by us  and by each of our current and future domestic subsidiaries 
until the second anniversary following their issuance  we may redeem up to of the original principal amount of the notes during each month period at of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
thereafter  we may redeem all or part of the notes at a prepayment premium which will decline over time 
we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest if we experience a change of control 
the indenture for the notes contains customary covenants for non investment grade indebtedness  including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness  to declare or pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock  to invest the proceeds of asset sales  and to engage in transactions with affiliates 
as required by the notes indenture  at closing  we deposited into escrow million  which was of the aggregate issue price of the notes  plus an amount necessary to pay the interest on the notes from and including the issue date of the notes to  but excluding  march  the holders of the notes had a first priority lien on the amounts in the escrow account 
this amount was in escrow on december  and was released in connection with the closing of the pgs onshore acquisition on february  we used a portion of the amounts released from escrow to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of the pgs onshore acquisition  repay existing indebtedness and to pay related expenses 
revolving credit facilities pnc credit facility 
on june   we and four of our subsidiaries collectively  the borrowers completed the closing of a credit facility under the terms of a revolving credit  term loan and security agreement collectively  the credit agreement dated as of june  with pnc bank  national association pnc  as lender 
we pledged our assets as security to pnc 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt and purchase additional assets 
this credit agreement has been amended several times to among other things increase the revolving credit and expenditures facilities 
the amount available to borrow under the revolver is dependent upon the calculation of a monthly borrowing base that is composed of eligible accounts receivables and eligible fixed assets 
the borrowing base can fluctuate from time to time due to fluctuations in accounts receivable balances 
additionally  a portion of the borrowing base is composed of eligible fixed assets 
we further amended the credit agreement with pnc on february  among other things  the amended agreement increased our borrowing base that can come from eligible fixed assets to million and deferred any reductions to this new amount until june   at which time  the amount of the borrowing base that can come from eligible fixed assets started to be reduced by 
table of contents million per month until maturity 
this reduction only affected the amount of the borrowing base that can come from eligible fixed assets and did not reduce the overall amount of the revolver 
based on our borrowing base at december   we had available credit under this facility of million reduced by standby letters of credit totaling million issued by pnc under the revolver 
at december   we had a balance of million drawn under the revolver 
the outstanding amount under this facility on february  was fully repaid as this facility was replaced with a new revolving credit facility with the royal bank of canada rbc on that date 
rbc credit facility 
on december   we received a commitment from rbc to provide a new million senior secured revolving credit facility and we closed on this new facility on february  the revolving credit facility will mature on february   three years after the closing of the pgs onshore acquisition 
we may borrow  repay and re borrow under the revolving credit facility at any time following february   until the maturity date of the facility 
borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at a floating rate based on the greater of i per year  ii prime rate  iii above the federal funds rate  or iv above one month libor  plus an applicable margin between and until june  beginning june   the applicable margin will range between and depending on our total leverage ratio 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by geokinetics and each of its existing and each subsequently acquired or organized wholly owned us direct or indirect material subsidiary of geokinetics 
each of the entities guaranteeing the revolving credit facility will secure the guarantees on a first priority basis with a lien on substantially all of the assets of such guarantor 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are deemed priority bank debt under the inter creditor agreement with the holders of the notes  and so the notes will be effectively subordinated to borrowings under the revolving credit facility pursuant to such inter creditor agreement 
capital lease obligations we have several equipment lease agreements with cit group equipment financing  inc cit for seismic and other transportation equipment with terms of up to months and various interest amounts 
the original amount of the leases was approximately million and the balance at december  was approximately million 
these amounts were repaid on february  in connection with the closing of the pgs onshore acquisition  and therefore  have been classified as short term at december  we also have four equipment lease agreements with bradesco leasing in brazil with terms of months at a rate of per year 
the original amount of the leases was approximately million and the balance at december  was approximately million 
other from time to time  we enter into vendor financing arrangements to purchase certain equipment 
the equipment purchased from these vendors is paid over a period of time 
the total balance of vendor financing arrangements at december  was approximately million 
these amounts were repaid on february  in connection with the closing of the pgs onshore acquisition  and therefore  have been classified as short term at december  in conjunction with the acquisition of pgs  we received a commitment from rbc to make a bridge loan in the amount of million 
the proceeds from this loan would have been used to finance the pgs onshore acquisition and repay our existing indebtedness if the senior secured notes offering was not completed 
we paid a commitment fee for the bridge loan of approximately 
table of contents million 
the bridge loan commitment terminated upon the completion of the pgs onshore acquisition 
we have made  and expect to continue to make  significant investments in capital expenditures 
in  we incurred million in capital expenditures 
we expect to update our capital expenditure budget to include pgs onshore in the coming months 
our board of directors has approved a capital expenditure budget for of million  which is an increase of from capital expenditures in we expect investments in to be primarily targeted toward expansion of our shallow water capabilities  expansion of our international operations and maintenance capital expenditures 
in addition  our board of directors has approved multi client data library investments for of million to date subject to certain minimum pre funding levels 
this amount does not include any amounts for multi client data library investments related to pgs onshore or other surveys in progress of being developed which will be approved at a later date 
we expect our investments in to be primarily focused on the expansion of our existing multi client data library interests in the marcellus shale in pennsylvania 
we believe that our current cash balances and anticipated cash flow from our seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing operations  combined with available debt financing  will provide sufficient liquidity to continue operations throughout should our current sources of liquidity not meet our operating requirements  we would be forced to seek outside sources of capital to meet our operating and capital requirements and or curtail our capital expenditure program 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
use of estimates in preparing consolidated financial statements we use estimates and assumptions in preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us those estimates and assumptions are included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the more significant areas requiring the use of our estimates relate to accounting for contracts in process  evaluating the outcome of uncertainties involving claims against or on our behalf  determining useful lives for depreciation and amortization purposes  cash flow projections and fair values used in the determination of asset 
table of contents impairment 
while we believe current estimates are reasonable and appropriate  actual results could differ materially from current estimates 
fair values of financial instruments effective january   we adopted asc topic as it relates to financial assets and financial liabilities  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principals and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
hierarchical levels  as defined in this guidance and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities  are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg  interest rates  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
level inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
the reported fair values for financial instruments that use level and level inputs to determine fair value are based on a variety of factors and assumptions 
accordingly  certain fair values may not represent actual values of our financial instruments that could have been realized as of december  or that will be realized in the future and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual sale or settlement 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable and short term debt approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments 
we believe the fair value of our long term debt at december   based on level measurement  and series b and series c preferred stock  based on level measurement  to be approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
we are not a party to any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreement or other derivative financial instruments 
our seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing segments utilize foreign subsidiaries and branches to conduct operations outside of the united states 
these operations expose us to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates 
revenue recognition our services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
customer contracts for services vary in terms and conditions 
contracts are either turnkey or term agreements or a combination of the two 
under turnkey agreements or the turnkey portions thereof  we recognize revenue based upon output measures as work is performed 
this method requires that we recognize revenue based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as square miles or linear kilometers acquired 
with respect to those contracts where the customer pays separately for the mobilization of equipment  we recognize such mobilization fees as revenue during the performance of the seismic data acquisition  using the same performance method as for the acquisition work 
we also receive revenue for certain third party charges under the terms of the service contracts 
we record amounts billed to customers in revenue as the gross amount including third party charges  if applicable  that are paid by the customer 
our 
table of contents turnkey or term contracts generally do not contain cancellation provisions that would prevent us from being compensated for work performed prior to cancellation due to milestones not being met or work not being performed within a particular timeframe 
in some instances  customers are billed in advance of work performed and we recognize the advance billing as deferred revenue 
we account for multi client data sales as follows a pre funding arrangements we obtain funding from a limited number of customers before a seismic project is completed 
in return for the pre funding  the customer typically gains the ability to direct or influence the project specifications  to access data as it is being acquired and to pay discounted prices 
we recognize pre funding revenue as the services are performed on a proportional performance basis usually determined by comparing the completed square miles of a seismic survey to the survey size unless specific facts and circumstances warrant another measure 
progress is measured in a manner generally consistent with the physical progress on the project  and revenue is recognized based on the ratio of the project s progress to date  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
b late sales when we grant a license to a customer  the customer is entitled to have access to a specifically defined portion of the multi client data library 
our customer s license payment is fixed and determinable and typically is required at the time that the license is granted 
we recognize revenue for late sales when our customer executes a valid license agreement and has received the underlying data or has the right to access the licensed portion of the data and collection is reasonably assured 
c sales of data jointly owned by us and partner we have jointly acquired surveys with a partner whereby we share the costs of acquisition and earn license revenues when processed data is delivered by our partner to the ultimate client 
as such  these revenues are recognized when the processed data is delivered to the ultimate client 
as a result of the nature of our services  we from time to time engage with customers in renegotiations or revisions of service contracts  which represent contingent revenues that are recognized only when the amounts have been received or awarded 
deferred revenue consists primarily of customer payments made in advance of work done  milestone billings and mobilization revenue  amortized over the term of the related contract 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
costs related to the development of internal use software and software developed for license for our customers are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the lesser of the lease term  as applicable 
repairs and maintenance  which are not considered betterments and do not extend the useful life of property  are charged to expense as incurred 
when property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of  the asset and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds either the fair value or the estimated discounted cash flows of the assets  whichever is more readily measurable 
at december  and  we deemed no such assets were impaired 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired net of the fair value of liabilities assumed 
overall accounting for goodwill topic of the fasb accounting standards codification requires intangible assets with indefinite lives  including goodwill  be evaluated on an annual basis for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change which could potentially result in an impairment 
the impairment test requires the allocation of goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value including goodwill  then goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value and the amount of any write down is reflected in operations 
all of our goodwill is related to our data acquisition segment 
while this segment consists of various geographical markets  we have concluded that it has only one reporting unit for purposes of the impairment test 
we perform impairment tests on the carrying value of our goodwill on an annual basis as of december st 
historically  we have used the income approach or the discounted cash flow method  which focuses on expected cash flows 
in applying this approach  the expected cash flow is projected based on assumptions regarding revenues  direct costs  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  applicable income taxes  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for a finite period of years  which was five years in our test 
the projected cash flows and the terminal value  which is an estimate of the value at the end of the finite period and assumes a long term growth rate  are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of the value of the reporting unit 
for our annual assessment as of december   due to the economic conditions affecting the industry  we also utilized the subject company valuation method  which makes a comparison of our projections to reasonably similar publicly traded companies 
in weighting the results of the various valuation approaches  we placed more emphasis on the income approach 
for the years ended december  and  our annual impairment test indicated the fair value of its reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the carrying amount 
intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also reviewed for impairment at least annually 
no impairment was deemed necessary 
multi client data library we capitalize all costs directly associated with acquiring and processing the data  including the depreciation of the assets used during production of the surveys 
we refer to these costs as our gross multi client investment 
the capitalized cost of the multi client data is charged to depreciation and amortization in the period the sales occur based on the greater of the percentage of total estimated costs to the total estimated sales in the first five years multiplied by actual sales  known as the sales forecast method  or the straight line amortization method over five years 
this minimum straight line amortization is recorded only if minimum amortization exceeds the cost of services calculated using the sales forecast method 
we periodically review the carrying value of the multi client data library to assess whether there has been a permanent impairment of value and records losses when it is determined that estimated future sales would not be sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the liability method based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

table of contents a valuation allowance is provided  if necessary  to reserve the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which we may not be able to use as a result of the expiration of maximum carryover periods allowed under applicable tax codes 
we apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of uncertain tax positions 
we recognize the amount of unrecognized tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement 
a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions is recognized in earnings in the quarter of such changes 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc topic  subsequent events 
this topic defines subsequent events as events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date  but before the financial statements are issued 
it defines two types of subsequent events recognized subsequent events  which provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date  and non recognized subsequent events  which provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date  but arose before the financial statements were issued 
recognized subsequent events are required to be recognized in the financial statements  and non recognized subsequent events are required to be disclosed 
asc topic requires entities to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated  and the basis for that date 
asc topic is consistent with current practice and did not have any impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the statement makes the fasb accounting standards codification the codification the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards  but it does not change us gaap 
the asc topic is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  we have adopted asc topic and the financial statements for the year ended december  reflect the codification references 
the statement had no impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements for the twelve months ended december   that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s in the normal course of operations  we are exposed to market risks primarily from credit risk  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk  consist primarily of unsecured trade receivables 
in the normal course of business  we provide credit terms to its customers 
accordingly  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for possible losses which  when realized  have been within the range of our expectations 
we believe that our unreserved trade receivables at december   are collectible and that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 
we generally provide services to a relatively small group of key customers that account for a significant percentage of its accounts receivable at any given time 
our key customers vary over time 
we extend credit to various companies in the oil and natural gas industry  including our key customers  for the acquisition of seismic data  which results in a concentration of credit risk 
this concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in the economic or other conditions of our key customers and may accordingly impact our overall credit risk 
we have cash in bank and restricted cash which  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts 
we believe that  in light of the recent financial crisis  we do have some credit risk on cash and short term investments 
interest rate risk fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable debt obligations expose us to market risk 
we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates affecting our adjustable rate debt  and any future refinancing of our fixed rate debt and our future debt 
at december   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our credit facilities carrying variable interest rates 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we currently conduct business in many foreign countries 
as a company that derives a substantial amount of our revenue from sales internationally  we are subject to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against such other currencies have had in the past and can be expected in future periods to have a significant effect upon our results of operations 
while we attempt to reduce the risks associated with such exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot provide assurance that we will be effective in doing so or that fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we operate will not materially affect our results of operations in the future
