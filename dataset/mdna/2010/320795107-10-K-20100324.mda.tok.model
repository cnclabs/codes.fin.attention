sale of mariner finance in december   we completed the sale of our consumer finance company subsidiary  mariner finance  for a purchase price of approximately million 
we received million in cash at closing and a ownership stake in the new mariner finance entity 
under terms of the sale  million was placed in an escrow account to be paid to first mariner no later than months after 
table of contents the closing  after deducting any indemnification claims 
in accordance with fasb guidance  the results of mariner finance operations are not included in our consolidated continuing operations  but are shown on the consolidated statement of operations as discontinued operations 
we recorded a loss on the sale of mariner finance of million during see additional information on the discontinued operations of mariner finance in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap detailed in the fasb accounting codification codification and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the consolidated financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
when applying accounting policies in such areas that are subjective in nature  management must use its best judgment to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of underlying collateral  and the timing of loan charge offs 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio 
current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  the views of bank regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  and peer comparisons are also factors 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction and change in the interest rate environment  which may impact a borrower s ability to pay  legislation impacting the banking industry  and environmental and economic conditions specific to the bank s service areas 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  results may differ from our estimates 
securities available for sale securities available for sale are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate a permanent decline in value 
rather  it means that the prospects for near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the security 

table of contents the initial indication of otti for both debt and equity securities is a decline in the market value below the amount recorded for an investment  and the severity and duration of the decline 
in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost  recent events specific to the issuer  including investment downgrades by rating agencies and economic conditions of its industry  our intent to sell the investment  and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
for marketable equity securities  we also consider the issuer s financial condition  capital strength  and near term prospects 
for debt securities and for perpetual preferred securities that are treated as debt securities for the purpose of otti analysis  we also consider the cause of the price decline general level of interest rates and industry and issuer specific factors  the issuer s financial condition  near term prospects and current ability to make future payments in a timely manner  the issuer s ability to service debt  and any change in agencies ratings at evaluation date from acquisition date and any likely imminent action 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the security is segmented into credit and noncredit related componenets 
any impairment adjustment due to indentified credit related components is recorded as an adjustment to current period earnings  while noncredit related fair value adjustments are recorded through other comprehensive income 
in situations where we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security  the entire otti loss must be recognized in earnings 
income taxes income taxes are provided based on the liability method of accounting  which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
in general  we record deferred tax assets when the event giving rise to the tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is recognized to reduce any deferred tax assets that  based upon available information  it is more likely than not all  or any portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
assessing the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment and analysis of evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
in most cases  the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon us generating a sufficient level of taxable income in future periods  which can be difficult to predict 
given the nature of our deferred tax assets  management determined no valuation allowances were needed at either december  or the calculation of tax liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment since it involves the application of complex tax laws that are subject to different interpretations by us and the various tax authorities 
these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 
periodically and in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in inquiries and reviews by tax authorities that normally require management to provide supplemental information to support certain tax positions we take in our tax returns 
uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
management believes it has taken appropriate positions on its tax returns  although the ultimate outcome of any tax review cannot be predicted with certainty 
still  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the current and historical financial statements 

table of contents loan income recognition interest income on loans is accrued at the contractual rate based on the principal outstanding 
loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over the contractual loan terms 
accrual of interest is discontinued when its receipt is in doubt  which typically occurs when a loan becomes impaired 
any interest accrued to income in the year when interest accruals are discontinued is generally reversed 
management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when a loan is in the process of collection and the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to satisfy the principal balance and accrued interest 
loans are returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectibility has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to pay and remain current 
payments on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal 
real estate acquired through foreclosure we record foreclosed real estate assets at the lower of cost or estimated fair value on the acquisition date and at the lower of such initial amount or estimated fair value less estimated selling costs thereafter 
estimated fair value is based upon many subjective factors  including location and condition of the property and current economic conditions  among other things 
because the calculation of fair value relies on estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  results may differ from our estimates 
write downs at time of transfer are made through the allowance for loan losses 
write downs subsequent to transfer are included in our noninterest expenses  along with operating income  net of related expenses of such properties and gains or losses realized upon disposition 
results of operations and financial condition the following discussion compares our financial condition at december  to the financial condition at december  and results of operations for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and related notes as well as statistical information included elsewhere in this report 
performance overview we recorded a net loss of million for compared to net loss of million for  with diluted losses per share totaling for compared to diluted losses per share of in the decrease in net income and earnings per share was primarily a result of a loss on the discontinued operations of mariner finance of million in  compared to income from those operations of million in our net loss from continuing operations decreased by million  with increased noninterest income that was partially offset by decreased net interest income  increased provision for loan losses  increased noninterest expenses  and a decreased income tax benefits 
our results for were significantly impacted by persistent negative trends in both commercial and residential real estate markets 
we experienced significant charge offs in those loan types in million in residential real estate   in commercial real estate  and million in real estate construction and a substantial amount of these loans were moved to real estate acquired through foreclosure million of residential real estate loans  million in commercial real estate loans  and million in real estate construction loans 
in addition  as declines in real estate values have continued  we recorded additional write downs and losses on and expenses related to real estate acquired through foreclosure of million in the company provided for additional loan loss reserves throughout and for the anticipated loss exposure caused by the depressed real estate market 
in addition to these losses  earnings were further impacted by the loss of interest 
table of contents income on loans placed on nonaccrual status  the cost of carrying foreclosed properties  and higher legal and collection expenses relating to these loans 
our largest category of revenue  net interest income  decreased million or due to lower yields earned on average earning assets  coupled with a lower level of noninterest bearing liabilities 
noninterest income increased million or due primarily to increased mortgage banking revenue  decreased otti charges  and a recovery in value on our assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
our increase in total expenses resulted primarily due to increased deposit insurance premiums and increased expenses related to loan collections and foreclosures  including related professional fees 
the increase of  in the provision for loan losses reflects needed increases in the allowance for loan losses relating to weaknesses in the residential construction and development loan portfolio and to maintain reserve levels and replenish charge offs of residential mortgage and residential construction and development loans 
we recorded a loss on the discontinued operations of mariner finance of million in  compared to income from those operations in of million 
we recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million in compared to million in the return on average assets was for compared to for the return on average equity for was compared to for average equity to average assets was for compared to for the decrease in the return on average assets reflected the continuing effect of nonperforming assets and loan charge offs 
the decrease in the return on average equity was the result of the higher net loss in our total assets increased by million or during  a result of increased deposits  which increased cash and due from banks 
earning assets decreased million or from billion in to billion in deposits increased by million to billion at december  from million at december  stockholders equity decreased million or  reflecting the loss  partially offset by a decrease in other comprehensive loss due to the increase in the market value of securities classified as available for sale 
our asset quality showed improvement at december  compared to december  at december   our allowance for loan losses amounted to million  which totaled of nonperforming assets as of december   compared to as of december  our level of nonperforming assets decreased to of total assets at december  from of total assets at december  and our level of loans days delinquent and still accruing interest decreased to million from million in our ratio of net chargeoffs to average total loans was in compared to in bank capital adequacy levels as defined by banking regulation improved slightly from to and the bank was still considered adequately capitalized 
the ratios for the bank as of december  for our capital leverage  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets were   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  at december  our regulatory capital levels increased due primarily to the sale of mariner finance  which provided first mariner with the ability to infuse additional capital into the bank 
as a result of being below well capitalized levels  the bank may not place brokered certificates of deposits without the granting of a waiver from its regulators 
we are under agreements with regulators to raise our capital levels as described in additional detail later in this item under capital resources 
see also subsequent events later in this item for information on our attempts to raise additional capital 

table of contents results of operations net interest income margins our primary source of earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest expense we pay on interest bearing sources of funds  such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income we earn is determined mostly by the average balances volume and the rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our funding sources 
net interest income for decreased by million to million compared to million for due to an increase in volume of interest bearing liabilities  combined with a decrease in the yield on interest earning assets from in to in and a decrease in our level of noninterest bearing deposits 
partially offsetting this decrease was a decline in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities from in to in the net interest margin is the key performance measure for our net interest income 
our net interest margin is affected by our loan pricing  our mix of earning assets  levels of nonperforming assets  and our distribution and pricing of deposits and borrowings 
our net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets decreased to for  compared to for the decrease in the rates paid on interest bearing sources of funds slightly mitigated the net interest margin decline 
interest income total interest income decreased by million from to due primarily to the decreased yield on average earning assets 
yields on earning assets for the year decreased to from  while average earning assets increased million 
we experienced decreased yields on most major earning asset categories  primarily a result of the lower interest rate environment in additionally  our interest income was negatively affected by increased interest reversals on and increased average balances of nonaccrual loans 
the yields on interest bearing deposits and restricted stock investments were particularly affected by the low rate environment in the yield on loans decreased from for to for  due to lower rates and higher nonperforming assets 
average loans outstanding for increased by million when compared to we experienced increases in commercial loans and lines of credit million  commercial mortgages million  residential mortgages million  and consumer loans million  which were partially offset by decreases in commercial and consumer construction loans million and million  respectively 
average loans held for sale increased million 
the decrease in both commercial and consumer residential construction loans was due primarily to the deterioration of the real estate market  which has led to the reduction of new construction  as well as increased write downs of nonperforming loans and increased foreclosures in these sectors  which have caused management to strategically reduce lending in these areas 
the increases in commercial loans and lines of credit and in commercial mortgages were due to a focus on commercial lending in  which was altered in away from loan growth towards improved asset quality 
the increase in residential mortgage loans was due primarily to increased mortgage lending activity  which reflected management s strategic decision to focus on mortgage lending while stabilizing the asset quality of the commercial loan portfolio 
the increased mortgage lending activity was also reflected in the increase in average loans held for sale 
consumer loans increased due to increased demand for consumer products in average securities decreased by million  due primarily to normal principal repayments on mortgage backed securities and deteriorations in value on certain securities due to the current economic conditions 

table of contents interest expense interest expense decreased by million to million for  compared to million for the same period in we experienced a decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  from for to for  which was partially offset by a higher level of interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing deposits from in to in was driven primarily by decreases in the rates on money market accounts and time deposits  partially offset by increases in the rates on now accounts 
average interest bearing deposits increased by million primarily due to an increase in the volume of time deposits  including brokered deposits 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we began a national certificate of deposit campaign nonbrokered which offers certificates of deposit for terms from six months to five years at a maximum of basis points above the national average 
this campaign has brought in approximately million in new time deposits 
an increase in average borrowings of million was due primarily to increases in our short term fhlb advances 
we experienced a decrease in the costs of borrowed funds from for to for due to the decline in variable rate trust preferred security costs  as well as lower short term borrowing costs

our noninterest income for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  due primarily to an increase in mortgage banking revenue  an insurance recovery of  a recovery in value on our assets and liabilities carried at fair value  and a decrease in net otti charges of million 

table of contents mortgage banking revenue increased from million in to million in due to a larger volume of originations of loans and higher margins on loans sold

we will realize the benefits of the incentives in our reported earnings as the credits can be utilized  in accordance with accounting standards that govern the recognition of investment tax credits 
the amount of the credit that we can utilize will largely be determined by the level of maryland taxable income for the bank only  and will be recognized as a reduction in our income tax expense

management has determined that a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was not required as of december  discontinued operations in accordance with fasb guidance  the operating results of mariner finance  along with the loss recognized on the sale are included in the consolidated statement of operations as discontinued operations

we funded the growth in overall assets with increases in deposits million 
securities our investment portfolio at december  is comprised of marketable securities 
the maturity structure of our investment portfolio is significantly influenced by the level of prepayment activity on mortgage backed securities 
at december   the average duration of our investment portfolio was years  significantly shorter than the average duration of years at december   primarily due to the decrease in the projected lives of mortgage backed securities 

table of contents we utilize the securities portfolio as part of our overall asset liability management practices to enhance interest revenue while providing necessary liquidity for the funding of loan growth or deposit withdrawals 
we continually monitor the credit risk associated with corporate investments and diversify the risk in the corporate portfolio

table of contents the trust preferred securities we hold in our securities portfolio were issued by other banks and bank holding companies 
certain of these securities have experienced declines in credit ratings from credit rating firms  which have devalued these specific securities 
these declines have occurred primarily over the past two years due to changes in the market which has limited the demand for these securities and reduced their liquidity 
while some of these issuers have reported weaker financial performance since acquisition of these securities  in management s opinion  they continue to possess acceptable credit risk 
we monitor the actual default rates and interest deferrals for possible losses and contractual shortfalls of interest or principal  which could warrant further recognition of impairment 
we recorded net otti charges of million during the year ended december  on trust preferred securities 
we recorded net otti of  on two of our equity securities during the year ended december  all of the remaining securities that are temporarily impaired are impaired due to declines in fair values resulting from changes in interest rates or increased credit liquidity spreads compared to the time they were purchased 
we have the intent to hold these securities to maturity and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of value

loans our loan portfolio is expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets  the absolute volume and mix of loans and the volume and mix of loans as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of our net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio as of december dollars in thousands commercial loans and lines of credit commercial construction commercial mortgages consumer residential construction residential mortgages consumer total loans total loans decreased million during we experienced higher balances in commercial mortgage loans million and residential mortgage loans million 
commercial and consumer residential construction balances decreased million and million  respectively  as did commercial loans and lines of credit million 
the decline in consumer loans is a result of the sale of our consumer finance subsidiary  mariner finance 
during  we were less aggressive in our loan origination activity  as we focused on improving asset quality in the current poor market environment 
approximately of our loans have adjustable rates as of december  compared to approximately at december   including adjustable rate first mortgage loans indexed to either us treasury obligations or libor and variable home equity lines of credit tied to the prime 
table of contents interest rate 
our variable rate loans adjust to the current interest rate environment  whereas fixed rates do not allow this flexibility 
if interest rates were to increase in the future  our interest earned on the variable rate loans would improve  and if rates were to fall  the interest we earn would decline  thus impacting our interest income 
some variable rate loans have rate floors which may delay changes in interest income in a period of changing rates 
see our discussion in interest rate sensitivity later in this section for more information on interest rate fluctuations 
the following table sets forth the maturity distribution for our loan portfolio at december  some of our loans may be renewed or repaid prior to maturity

of the total included above  million represents loans made to borrowers for the development of residential real estate at december  this segment of the portfolio has exhibited greater weakness during due to overall weakness in the residential housing sector 
as of december   million of these loans are on nonaccrual 
the breakdown of the portion of the commercial construction portfolio made to borrowers for residential real estate is as follows as of december dollars in thousands raw residential land residential subdivisions single residential lots single family construction townhome construction condominium unit construction multi family unit construction credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a borrower to meet its obligations 
we manage credit risk by evaluating the risk profile of the borrower  repayment sources  the nature of the underlying collateral  and other support given current events  conditions  and expectations 
we attempt 
table of contents to manage the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio through various control processes  such as credit evaluation of borrowers  establishment of lending limits  and application of lending procedures  including the holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances 
however  we seek to rely primarily on the cash flow of our borrowers as the principal source of repayment 
although credit policies and evaluation processes are designed to minimize our risk  management recognizes that loan losses will occur and the amount of these losses will fluctuate depending on the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio  as well as general and regional economic conditions 
we provide for loan losses through the establishment of an allowance for loan losses by provisions charged against earnings 
our allowance represents an estimated reserve for existing losses in the loan portfolio 
we deploy a systematic methodology for determining our allowance that includes a quarterly review process  risk rating  and adjustment to our allowance 
we classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk separately as discussed below 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance continually based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other loans that we believe require special attention 
the allowance consists of three elements specific reserves and valuation allowances for individual credits  general reserves for types or portfolios of loans based on historical loan loss experience  judgmentally adjusted for current conditions and credit risk concentrations  and unallocated reserves 
combined specific reserves and general reserves by loan type are considered allocated reserves 
all outstanding loans are considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance 
commercial our commercial portfolio includes all secured and unsecured loans to borrowers for commercial purposes  including commercial lines of credit and commercial real estate 
our process for evaluating commercial loans includes performing updates on all loans that we have rated for risk 
our commercial loans are generally reviewed individually  in accordance with the fasb s guidance on accounting for loan impairment  to determine impairment  accrual status  and the need for specific reserves 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both qualitative and quantitative 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience by loan type  collateral values  financial condition of borrowers  and other factors 
qualitative factors include judgments concerning general economic conditions that may affect credit quality  credit concentrations  the pace of portfolio growth  and delinquency levels  these qualitative factors are evaluated in connection with the unallocated portion of our allowance for loan losses 
we periodically engage outside firms and experts to independently assess our methodology and perform various loan review functions 
the process of establishing the allowance with respect to our commercial loan portfolio begins when a loan officer initially assigns each loan a risk rating  using established credit criteria 
approximately of our risk grades are subject to review and validation annually by an independent consulting firm  as well as periodically by our internal credit review function 
our methodology employs management s judgment as to the level of future losses on existing loans based on our internal review of the loan portfolio  including an analysis of the borrowers current financial position  and the consideration of current and anticipated economic conditions and their potential effects on specific borrowers and or lines of business 
in determining our ability to collect certain loans  we also consider the fair value of any underlying collateral 
in addition  we evaluate credit risk concentrations  including trends in large dollar exposures to related borrowers  industry and geographic concentrations  and economic and environmental factors 
a commercial loan is determined to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in general  impaired loans both commercial and consumer include nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructure tdr loans 
such a loan is not considered impaired during a minimal 
table of contents period of delay in payment if we expect to collect all amounts due  including past due interest 
we generally consider a minimal period of delay in payment to include delinquency up to days 
commercial loans we consider impaired at december  and december  totaled million and million  respectively 
the reserve for loan losses for commercial impaired loans was  at december  and million at december  the average recorded investment in commercial impaired loans was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  and no income has been accrued or collected on the majority of these loans while they have been classified as impaired 
the allowance for impaired loans both commercial and consumer represents the fair value deficiencies for those loans for which the estimated fair value of the collateral was less than our carrying amount of the loan as of december  not all of the loans newly classified as impaired since december  required impairment reserves  as some of the loans collateral had estimated fair values greater than the carrying amount of the loan or the loan has been written down to its estimated fair value 
consumer our consumer portfolio includes first and second lien mortgage loans and other loans to individuals 
generally  consumer loans are segregated into homogeneous pools with similar risk characteristics 
trends and current conditions in consumer and residential mortgage pools are analyzed and historical loss experience is adjusted accordingly 
quantitative and qualitative adjustment factors for the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios are consistent with those for the commercial portfolios 
consumer loans that are greater than days past due are generally charged off 
consumer loans we consider impaired at december  and december  totaled million and million  respectively 
the reserve for loan losses for consumer impaired loans was  at december  and million at december  the average recorded investment in consumer impaired loans was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
additional information about our nonaccrual loans  including interest income that we would have received had these loans been performing according to their contractual terms  is found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
residential mortgage loans residential mortgage loans  including alt a second mortgages  are analyzed as pools with historical loss rates applied 
management generally may modify the historical loss rates based upon prevailing economic conditions or trends in delinquency and loss 
loans delinquent greater than days are individually reviewed and assessed for accrual status and the need for specific reserves 
repurchased loans 
in accordance with relevant accounting guidance on accounting for loans and debt securities acquired in a transfer  we record repurchased loans at their estimated fair value at the time of repurchase 
at december  and  we maintained million and million  respectively  in loans repurchased in accordance with covenants in our sales agreements with investors 
all repurchased loans which were days delinquent as of december  were evaluated individually for impairment  with any estimated loss compared to the carrying amount recorded as a specific reserve 
all other repurchased loans were evaluated collectively for impairment 
all repurchased nonaccrual loans are currently in the process of collection and the resolution of many of these loans may be through foreclosure of the property 

table of contents transferred loans 
in accordance with the fasb s guidance on accounting for certain mortgage banking activities  any loans which are originally originated for sale into the secondary market and which we subsequently elect to transfer into the company s loan portfolio are valued at fair value at the time of the transfer with any decline in value recorded as a charge to operating expense 
we maintain million in first lien mortgage loans and million in second lien mortgage loans that were transferred from loans held for sale to our mortgage and consumer loan portfolios  respectively at december  we maintained million in transferred first lien mortgage loans and million in transferred second lien mortgage loans at december  in establishing a loan s estimated fair value  management makes significant assumptions concerning the ultimate collectibility of delinquent loans and their ultimate realizable value 
while these projections are made with the most current data available to management  actual realized losses could differ due to the changes in the borrowers willingness or ability to resolve the delinquency status  changes in the actual volume of future repurchases  changes in the real estate market  or changes in market values of those loans which are liquidated 
management updates these assumptions continually as greater experience becomes available 
unallocated the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for losses that are not identified when establishing the specific and general portions of the allowance and is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
such conditions include general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit quality trends including trends in delinquencies and nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio categories  recent loss experience in particular loan categories  duration of the current business cycle  bank regulatory examination results  findings of external loan review examiners  and management s judgment with respect to various other conditions including loan administration and management and the quality of risk identification systems 
executive management reviews these conditions quarterly 
we have risk management practices designed to ensure timely identification of changes in loan risk profiles  however  undetected losses may exist inherently within the loan portfolio 
the judgmental aspects involved in applying the risk grading criteria  analyzing the quality of individual loans  and assessing collateral values can also contribute to undetected  but probable  losses 
our total allowance at december  is considered by management to be sufficient to address the credit losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
however  our determination of the appropriate allowance level is based upon a number of assumptions we make about future events  which we believe are reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that our charge offs in future periods will not exceed our allowance for loan losses or that we will not need to make additional increases in our allowance for loan losses

the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the changes in the allowance from period to period reflects management s ongoing application of its methodologies to establish the allowance  which  in  included increases in the allowance for commercial mortgage loans which received internal risk rating downgrades during the year  as well as increases to reflect negative market trends and other qualitative factors 
the allowance for loan losses may not move in direct proportion to changes in our overall trends in delinquent  nonperforming  or impaired loans 
the specific loans that make up those categories change from period to period 
impairment on those loans  which would be reflected in the allowance for loan losses  might or might not exist  depending on the specific circumstances of each loan 
specific and general reserves for the commercial construction and the residential mortgage portfolios decreased million and  respectively and reflect the movement of delinquent loans through the foreclosure process and the partial charge offs of certain loans with specific reserves as of december  during  we charged off million in commercial construction loans and million in residential mortgage loans 
the specific and general reserves for commercial mortgages increased as delinquencies increased and collateral values decreased 
specific and general reserves for consumer loans decreased due to the sale of our consumer finance subsidiary  mariner finance 
unallocated reserves increased primarily based upon qualitative market area factors  including  among other things  the current poor market environment 
in  million in loans were transferred to real estate acquired through foreclosure as they moved through the foreclosure process 

table of contents the provision for loan losses recognized to maintain the allowance was million for compared to million for million of which was attributable to mariner finance 
we recorded net charge offs of million during compared to net charge offs of million in  primarily due to increases in net charge offs of construction loans  commercial loans  and commercial mortgages 
during  net charge offs as compared to average loans outstanding increased to  compared to during our allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans has decreased from as of december  to as of december   reflecting the changes in our loss estimates and the results of the application of our loss estimate methodology 
charge offs and transfers to real estate acquired through foreclosure continued to be significant in  however  asset quality began improving at the end of  with fewer loans becoming delinquent and or impaired 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  although management uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors 
as a result  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 

table of contents nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  expressed as a percentage of total assets  totaled at december  and at december  the following tables show the distribution of nonperforming assets and loans greater than days past due and still accruing as of december dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans commercial loans and lines of credit commercial construction commercial mortgages consumer residential construction alt a mortgages other residential mortgages other consumer real estate acquired through foreclosure commercial loans and lines of credit commercial construction commercial mortgages consumer residential construction alt a mortgages other residential mortgages other consumer total nonperforming assets loans past due days or more and accruing commercial loans and lines of credit commercial construction commercial mortgages consumer residential construction alt a mortgages other residential mortgages other consumer includes both first and second lien loans nonaccrual loans decreased million between december  and december   as troubled loans moved through the process of charge off and or foreclosure 
additionally  the nonaccrual balance at december  included million in mariner finance consumer loans 
although total nonaccrual loans decreased  we did experience increases in nonaccrual commercial mortgages and other residential mortgages 
the commercial mortgage loan nonaccrual balance consisted of loans  with the largest balance amounting to million 
all of these loans were placed on nonaccrual status during all of the commercial mortgage loans that were on nonaccrual in were paid off by the borrower  charged off and or foreclosed  or otherwise resolved as a performing asset during the residential mortgage nonaccrual balance consisted of loans  with the largest balance amounting to  the majority of these loans were placed on nonaccrual status during 
table of contents real estate acquired through foreclosure increased million when compared to december  as more loans moved through the foreclosure process 
commercial and consumer construction properties increased due to the addition of properties for million  partially offset by write downs and disposals of properties 
the increase in commercial mortgages was due to the addition of properties in the amount of million  partially offset by write downs and disposals of properties 
foreclosed consumer properties consisted primarily of two properties  one in the amount of million 
real estate acquired through foreclosure is carried at estimated fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
loans days delinquent and accruing  which are loans that are well secured and in the process of collection  decreased from million at december  to million as of december  included in the decrease are decreases in consumer residential construction loans of million and alt a residential mortgage loans of million 
increases occurred in the commercial  commercial mortgage  and residential mortgage portfolios 
the commercial mortgage total  which increased due to the deterioration of the commercial real estate market  is made up of loans  with the largest balance amounting to million 
the other residential mortgage total is made up of loans  with the largest loan totaling  the residential real estate market continues to be depressed in our market area 
we had one commercial loan in the amount of  included in loans days delinquent and accruing 
troubled debt restructures troubled debt restructures  which are loans that have been restructured due to the borrower s inability to maintain a current status on the loan  that are not included in the nonaccrual balance above amounted to approximately million for and million for our tdrs are generally reviewed individually  at the time of restructure  to determine impairment  accrual status  and the need for specific reserves 
for collateral dependent loans  we utilize the fair value of the collateral in determining impairment 
for noncollateral dependent loans  we calculate the present value of expected future cash flows to determine fair value and impairment 
potential problem loans potential problem loans consist of loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  however  management has designated these assets as potential problem loans due to concerns about the ability of the obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms that may result from the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties 
at the end of  loans of this type that are not included in the above table of nonperforming and past due loans amounted to approximately million  compared to million at the end of potential problem commercial loans  including loans secured by real estate  increased million  while consumer residential construction potential problem loans decreased by million 
seventy nine of the loans of total potential problem loans are commercial relationships that are secured by commercial real estate and other business assets that are considered sufficient to collect all amounts due in the event of deterioration in the customer s financial condition 
the remaining loans of total potential problem loans are consumer residential construction loans that are secured by property with residential real estate as the highest and best use and have an appraised value in excess of the carrying value of the loan 
the average relationship was  and the largest relationship outstanding balance was million at december  depending on changes in the economy and other future events  these loans and others not presently identified as potential problem loans could be reclassified as nonperforming or impaired loans in the future 

table of contents deposits we use deposits as the primary source of funding of our loans 
we offer individuals and businesses a wide variety of deposit accounts 
these accounts include checking  savings  money market  and certificates of deposit and are obtained primarily from communities we serve 
deposits totaled billion as of december   increasing million or over the december  balance of million  primarily due to an aggressive time deposit marketing campaign 
we took in approximately million in time deposits associated with a newly launched program for acquiring nonbrokered national deposits 
the following table details the average amount and the average rate paid for each category of deposits as of december dollars in thousands average balance average rate average balance average rate average balance average rate now accounts money market accounts savings accounts time deposits total interest bearing deposits noninterest bearing demand deposits total deposits the following table provides the maturities of certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more at december dollars in thousands maturing in months or less over months through months over months through months over months core deposits represent deposits which we believe will not be affected by changes in interest rates and  therefore  will be retained regardless of the movement of interest rates 
we consider our core deposits to be all noninterest bearing  now  money market accounts less than  and saving deposits  as well as all time deposits less than  that mature in greater than one year 
at december   our core deposits were million 
the remainder of our deposits could be susceptible to attrition due to interest rate movements 
borrowings our borrowings consist of short term promissory notes issued to certain qualified investors  short term and long term advances from the fhlb  and a mortgage loan at december  at december   our borrowings also included a line of credit to finance consumer receivables held by mariner finance 
our short term promissory notes are in the form of commercial paper  which reprice daily and have maturities of days or less 
our advances from the fhlb may be in the form of short term or long term obligations 
short term advances have maturities for one year or less and 
table of contents can be paid without penalty 
long term borrowings through the fhlb have original maturities up to years and generally contain prepayment penalties 
long term borrowings  which totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively  consist of long term advances from the fhlb and a mortgage loan on our former headquarters building  and  in  mariner finance s consumer finance receivable line of credit 
the amortized cost of long term fhlb advances totaled million at december  and december   however  million of the advances are recorded at fair value million at december  and million at december  in accordance with fasb guidance  making the total carrying amount of long term fhlb advances million at december  and million at december  as of december  and december   the balance on the mortgage loan was million and million  respectively 
the december  balance on the consumer receivable line of credit was million 
short term borrowings consist of short term promissory notes and short term advances from the fhlb 
these borrowings decreased from million at december  to million at december  in the past  to further our funding and capital needs  we raised capital by issuing trust preferred securities through statutory trusts the trusts  which are wholly owned by first mariner bancorp 
the trusts used the proceeds from the sales of the trust preferred securities  combined with first mariner bancorp s equity investment in these trusts  to purchase subordinated deferrable interest debentures from first mariner bancorp 
the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts 
aggregate debentures as of december  and december  were million 
the trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable  in whole or in part  upon repayment of their underlying subordinated debentures at their respective maturities or their earlier redemption 
the subordinated debentures are redeemable prior to maturity at first mariner s option on or after the optional redemption dates 
beginning with january payments  first mariner suspended interest payments on the debentures  as permitted under the terms of the debentures 
the suspension does not constitute an event of default 
the debentures continue to accrue interest  which will have to be fully repaid prior to the expiration of the deferral period 
the total deferral period may not exceed consecutive quarters 
first mariner bancorp has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the obligations of the trusts 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  a portion of the trust preferred securities will qualify as tier i capital  and the remaining portion will qualify as tier ii capital 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  million of the outstanding trust preferred securities qualify as tier i capital and million of the remaining trust preferred securities qualify as tier ii capital at december  the total amount of our trust preferred securities allowable as part of capital was limited to million as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k for further details about our borrowings and additional borrowing capacity 
see subsequent events later in this section for information regarding the subsequent event related to the trust preferred securities 
capital resources stockholders equity decreased million during to million at december  from million at december  the retained deficit increased by the net loss of million for  partially offset by the cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment related to securities of million

accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is derived from the fair value calculations for securities available for sale  decreased by million 
see subsequent events later in this section for subsequent events related to authorized shares and other capital considerations 
banking regulatory authorities have implemented strict capital guidelines directly related to the credit risk associated with an institution s assets 
banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain capital levels based on their risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with higher defined credit risks will require more capital support than assets with lower risk 
additionally  capital must be maintained to support certain off balance sheet instruments 
capital is classified as tier capital common stockholders equity less certain intangible assets plus a portion of the trust preferred securities and total capital tier plus the allowed portion of the allowance for loan losses plus any off balance sheet reserves and the portion of trust preferred securities not included in tier capital 
minimum required levels must at least equal for tier capital and for total capital 
in addition  institutions must maintain a minimum of leverage capital ratio tier capital to average total assets for the previous quarter 
we regularly monitor our capital adequacy ratios and attempt to ensure that we meet our regulatory capital requirements 
the regulatory capital ratios are shown below as of december december  minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provision regulatory capital ratios leverage consolidated bank tier capital to risk weighted assets consolidated bank total capital to risk weighted assets consolidated bank on september   the bank entered into an agreement with the fdic and the maryland division of financial regulation the division  pursuant to which it consented to the entry of an order to cease and desist the september order  which directs the bank to i increase its capitalization  ii improve earnings  iii reduce nonperforming loans  iv strengthen management policies and practices  and v reduce reliance on noncore funding 
the september order replaces the informal agreement that was previously in place among the parties 
the september order requires the bank to adopt a plan to achieve and maintain a tier leverage capital ratio of at least of the bank s average total assets and a total risk based capital ratio of at least of its total risk weighted assets by june  the bank has presented a plan to the fdic and the division detailing how it will achieve a tier leverage capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by march   and a tier leverage capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by june  at december   the bank reported a tier leverage capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
within days after the end of each calendar year  the bank must submit an annual budget and profit plan and a plan that takes into account the bank s pricing structure  the bank s cost of funds and how this can be reduced  and the 
table of contents level of provision expense for adversely classified loans 
to address reliance on noncore funding  the bank must adopt and submit a liquidity plan intended to reduce the bank s reliance on noncore funding  wholesale funding sources  and high cost rate sensitive deposits 
while the september order is in effect  the bank may not pay dividends or management fees without the fdic s prior consent  the bank may not accept  renew  or roll over any brokered deposits or pay effective yields on deposits that are greater than those generally paid in its markets 
a copy of the september order was filed as an exhibit to the company s form k filed with the sec on september  and is filed as exhibit hereto 
first mariner bancorp is also a party to an agreement with the frb the frb agreement  which requires it to i develop and implement a strategic business plan that includes a actions that will be taken to improve our operating performance and reduce the level of parent company leverage  b a comprehensive budget and an expanded budget review process  c a description of the operating assumptions that form the basis for major projected income and expense components and provisions needed to maintain an adequate loan loss reserve  and d a capital plan incorporating all capital needs  risks and regulatory guidelines  and ii submit plans to improve enterprise wide risk management and effectiveness of internal audit programs 
first mariner bancorp has also agreed to provide the frb with advance notice of any significant capital transactions 
the new frb agreement new frb agreement prohibits first mariner and the bank from taking any of the following actions without the frb s prior written approval i declaring or paying any dividends  ii taking dividends from the bank  iii making any distributions of interest  principal or other sums on first mariners subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities  iv incurring  increasing or guaranteeing any debt  or v repurchasing  redeeming any shares of its stock 
under the new frb agreement  first mariner had to submit a written plan to the frb by january  to maintain sufficient capital  on a consolidated basis  such that first mariner satisfies the frb s minimum capital requirements 
to satisfy the frb s minimum capital requirements  first mariner s consolidated tier capital to average assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets ratios at each quarter end must be at least   and  respectively 
at december   those capital ratios were   and  respectively  which were at an under capitalized level under the prompt corrective action regulations of the frb

see discussion later in this section related to a trust preferred exchange subsequent event that is expected to raise our capital level to above adequately capitalized subsequent to december  on april   the bank entered into an agreement the april agreement with the fdic relating to alleged violations of consumer protection regulations relative to its fair lending practices pursuant to which it consented to the issuance of an order april order 
the april order requires the bank to pay up to  in restitution to the affected borrowers 
it also imposes a civil money penalty of  all amounts for which were fully reserved in the final quarter of in addition to requiring the bank to cease and desist from violating certain federal fair lending laws  the april orders also requires the bank to develop and implement policies and procedures to i monitor and ensure compliance with fair lending laws and disclosure laws and regulations  ii ensure that the costs  terms  features and risks of the loans and services are adequately disclosed to applicants  and iii develop an operating plan to maintain quality control  internal audit  and compliance management systems that are effective in ensuring that the bank s residential mortgage lending activities comply with all applicable laws  regulations  and bank policies 
the bank must also conduct or sponsor quarterly financial literacy and education courses where it provides residential mortgage loans 
further  the bank is prohibited from offering payment option adjustable rate mortgage loans  although the bank ceased offering these loans in a copy of the april order is an exhibit to the company s form k filed with the sec on may  and is filed as exhibit hereto 

table of contents management does not believe that the april order will have a material impact on the bank s financial performance 
management believes the successful satisfaction of the september order s requirements and the requirements of the frb agreement and new frb agreement will strengthen the financial condition of the bank for future periods 
the foregoing will subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and may have an adverse impact on our business operations 
failure to comply with the provisions of these regulatory requirements may result in more restrictive actions from our regulators  including more severe and restrictive enforcement actions 
as of december   first mariner had a total of million in outstanding trust preferred securities  of which amount  million was eligible for and included in tier capital and million of the remaining trust preferred securities was eligible for and included in tier ii capital 
the total amount of our trust preferred securities allowable as part of capital was limited to million as of december  see subsequent events later in this section for a subsequent event related to the trust preferred securities 
liquidity liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations  including lending commitments and contingencies  which arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers  as well as to meet current and planned expenditures 
these cash requirements are met on a daily basis through the inflow of deposit funds  and the maintenance of short term overnight investments  maturities and calls in our investment portfolio  and available lines of credit with the fhlb  which requires pledged collateral 
fluctuations in deposit and short term borrowing balances may be influenced by the interest rates paid  general consumer confidence  and the overall economic environment 
there can be no assurances that deposit withdrawals and loan fundings will not exceed all available sources of liquidity on a short term basis 
such a situation would have an adverse effect on our ability to originate new loans and maintain reasonable loan and deposit interest rates  which would negatively impact earnings 
the borrowing requirements of customers include commitments to extend credit and the unused portion of lines of credit collectively commitments  which totaled million at december  historically  many of the commitments expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
commitments for real estate development and construction  which totaled million at december   are generally short term in nature  satisfying cash requirements with principal repayments as construction properties financed are generally repaid with permanent financing 
available credit lines represent the unused portion of credit previously extended and available to the customer as long as there is no violation of material contractual conditions 
commitments to extend credit for residential mortgage loans of million at december  generally expire within days 
commercial commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit of million at december  generally do not extend for more than months 
consumer commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit of million at december  are generally open ended 
at december   available home equity lines totaled million 
home equity credit lines generally extend for a period of years 
capital expenditures for various branch locations and equipment can be a significant use of liquidity 
as of december   we plan on expending approximately million on our premises and equipment over the next months 
customer withdrawals are also a principal use of liquidity  but are generally mitigated by growth in customer funding sources  such as deposits and short term borrowings 
while balances may fluctuate up and down in any given period  historically we have experienced a steady increase in total customer funding sources 

table of contents the bank s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents which are cash on hand or amounts due from financial institutions  federal funds sold  money market mutual funds  and interest bearing deposits  available for sale and trading securities  loans held for sale  deposit accounts  brokered deposits  and borrowings 
the levels of such sources are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  and investing activities at any given time 
we continue to primarily rely on core deposits from customers to provide stable and cost effective sources of funding to support our loan growth 
we also seek to augment such deposits with longer term and higher yielding certificates of deposit 
cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million at december   have immediate availability to meet our short term funding needs 
our entire investment portfolio is classified as either available for sale or trading  is highly marketable  excluding our holdings of pooled trust preferred securities  and available to meet our liquidity needs 
loans held for sale  which totaled million at december   are committed to be sold into the secondary market and generally are funded within days 
our residential real estate portfolio includes loans that are underwritten to secondary market criteria and provide us an additional source of liquidity 
additionally  our residential construction loan portfolio provides a source of liquidity as construction periods generally range from months  and these loans are subsequently financed with permanent first lien mortgages and sold into the secondary market 
our loan to deposit ratio stood at as of december  and at december  we also have the ability to utilize established credit lines as additional sources of liquidity 
to utilize the vast majority of our credit lines  we must pledge certain loans and or securities before advances can be obtained 
as of december   we maintained lines of credit totaling million and funding capacity of million based upon loans and securities available for pledging and available overnight deposits 
the fhlb has reduced our line of credit from million to million  our current outstanding balance 
the federal reserve board has also notified the bank that it will permit the bank to draw on its line of credit with the federal reserve bank only in limited circumstances and for a short duration 
we are not permitted to purchase brokered deposits without first obtaining a regulatory waiver 
we are also required to comply with restrictions on deposit rates that we may offer 
these factors could significantly affect our ability to fund normal operations 
our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole as the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations in the domestic and worldwide credit markets deteriorates 
at december   management considered the bank s liquidity level to be sufficient for the purposes of meeting the bank s cash flow requirements 
first mariner bancorp is a separate entity and apart from first mariner bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  first mariner bancorp is responsible for the payment of any dividends that may be declared for its shareholders  and interest and principal on outstanding debt 
at times  first mariner bancorp has repurchased its stock 
a significant amount of first mariner bancorp s revenues are obtained from subsidiary service fees and dividends 
payment of such dividends to first mariner bancorp by first mariner bank is limited under maryland law 
for a maryland chartered bank or trust company  dividends may be paid out of undivided profits or  with the prior approval of the commissioner  from surplus in excess of of required capital stock 
if  however  the surplus of a maryland bank is less than of its required capital stock  cash dividends may not be paid in excess of of net earnings 
in addition to these specific restrictions  bank regulatory agencies also have the ability to prohibit proposed dividends by a financial institution which would otherwise be permitted under applicable regulations if the regulatory body determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
as noted earlier  first mariner and its bank subsidiary have entered into agreements with the frb  fdic  and the maryland banking commissioner that  among other things  require us to obtain the prior approval of our regulators

in addition  first mariner elected to defer regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with its trust preferred securities offerings 
first mariner is prohibited from paying any dividends or making any other distribution on its common stock for so long as interest payments are being deferred 
we are not aware of any known trends  demands  commitments  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes in our liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is an important factor in the management of the composition and maturity configurations of our earning assets and our funding sources 
the primary objective of our asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of our primary earnings component  net interest income 
our net interest income can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
we may attempt to structure the statement of financial condition so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
however  imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in time may be appropriate to mitigate risks from fee income subject to interest rate risk  such as mortgage banking activities 
the measurement of our interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the techniques used in asset liability management 
interest sensitive gap is the dollar difference between our assets and liabilities which are subject to interest rate pricing within a given time period  including both floating rate or adjustable rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
our management and our board of directors oversee the asset liability management function and meet periodically to monitor and manage the statement of financial condition  control interest rate exposure  and evaluate pricing strategies 
we evaluate the asset mix of the statement of financial condition continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  funding sources  and liquidity 
our management of the liability mix of the statement of financial condition focuses on expanding our various funding sources and promotion of deposit products with desirable repricing or maturity characteristics 
in theory  we can diminish interest rate risk through maintaining a nominal level of interest rate sensitivity 
in practice  this is made difficult by a number of factors including cyclical variation in loan demand  different impacts on our interest sensitive assets and liabilities when interest rates change  and the availability of our funding sources 
accordingly  we strive to manage the interest rate sensitivity gap by adjusting the maturity of and establishing rates on the earning asset portfolio and certain interest bearing liabilities commensurate with our expectations relative to market interest rates 
additionally  we may employ the use of off balance sheet instruments  such as interest rate swaps or caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
generally  we attempt to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities that is appropriate to minimize our overall interest rate risk  not just our net interest margin 

table of contents our interest rate sensitivity position as of december  is presented in the following table 
our assets and liabilities are scheduled based on maturity or repricing data except for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities that are based on prevailing prepayment assumptions and core deposits which are based on core deposit studies done for banks in the mid atlantic region 
these assumptions are validated periodically by management 
the difference between our rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  or the interest rate sensitivity gap  is shown at the bottom of the table 
as of december   our cumulative interest sensitive liabilities exceeded our cumulative interest sensitive assets within a one year period by million or of total assets  compared to interest sensitive liabilities exceeding interest sensitive assets by million or of total assets as of december  dollars in thousands days or less days one year one five years years or non sensitive total interest earning assets interest bearing deposits securities restricted stock investments loans held for sale loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts now accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit borrowings and junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitive gap position period of assets cumulative of assets cumulative risk sensitive assets to risk sensitive liabilities while we monitor interest rate sensitivity gap reports  we primarily test our interest rate sensitivity through the deployment of simulation analysis 
we use earnings simulation models to estimate what effect specific interest rate changes would have on our net interest income and net income 
simulation analysis provides us with a more rigorous and dynamic measure of interest sensitivity 
changes in prepayments have been included where changes in behavior patterns are assumed to be significant to the simulation  particularly mortgage related assets 
call features on certain securities and borrowings are based on their call probability in view of the projected rate change  and pricing features such as interest rate floors are incorporated 
our fee income produced by mortgage banking operations may also be impacted by changes in rates 
as long term rates increase  the volume of fixed rate mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market may decline and reduce our revenues generated by this line of business 
we attempt to structure our asset and liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net interest income by changes in market interest rates 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage interest rate risk so as to avoid significant adverse effects on 
table of contents net interest income 
at december   the simulation model provided the following profile of our interest rate risk measured over a one year time horizon  assuming a parallel shift in a yield curve based off the us dollar forward swap curve adjusted for certain pricing assumptions immediate rate change bp bp net interest income both of the above tools used to assess interest rate risk have strengths and weaknesses 
because the gap analysis reflects a static position at a single point in time  it is limited in quantifying the total impact of market rate changes which do not affect all earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally or simultaneously 
in addition  gap reports depict the existing structure  excluding exposure arising from new business 
while the simulation process is a powerful tool in analyzing interest rate sensitivity  many of the assumptions used in the process are highly qualitative and subjective  and are subject to the risk that past historical activity may not generate accurate predictions of the future 
the model also assumes parallel movements in interest rates  which means both short term and long term rates will change equally 
nonparallel changes in interest rates short term rates changing differently from long term rates could result in significant differences in projected income amounts when compared to parallel tests 
both measurement tools taken together  however  provide an effective evaluation of our exposure to changes in interest rates  enabling management to better control the volatility of earnings 
we are party to mortgage rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans at interest rates previously agreed locked by both us and the borrower for specified periods of time 
when the borrower locks an interest rate  we effectively extend a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but we must honor the interest rate for the specified time period 
we are exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments and loans prior to sale 
we utilize forward sales commitments to economically hedge the changes in fair value of the loan due to changes in market interest rates 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business 
these arrangements consist primarily of commitments to extend credit  lines of credit  and letters of credit 
in addition  the company has certain operating lease obligations 
credit commitments credit commitments are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition to the contract 
loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts  fixed expiration dates  and may require payment of a fee 
lines of credit generally have variable interest rates 
such lines do not represent future cash requirements because it is unlikely that all customers will draw upon their lines in full at any time 
letters of credit are commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is the contract amount of the commitment 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are made on the same terms  including collateral  as outstanding loans 
we are not aware of any accounting loss we would incur by funding our commitments 
see detailed information on credit commitments above under liquidity 

table of contents contractual obligations first mariner has certain obligations to make future payments under contract 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments are payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than one year over years over years after years certificates of deposit borrowings and junior subordinated debentures annual rental commitments under noncancelable leases derivatives we maintain and account for derivatives  in the form of irlcs  in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we recognize gains and losses on interest rate lock commitments or forward sales commitments on loan pipeline through mortgage banking revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
the bank  through first mariner mortgage  enters into irlcs  under which we originate residential mortgage loans with interest rates determined prior to funding 
irlcs on mortgage loans that we intend to sell in the secondary market are considered derivatives 
the period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from days to days 
for these irlcs  we protect the company from changes in interest rates through the use of forward sales of to be issued tba mortgage backed securities 
we are exposed to price risk from the time a mortgage loan closes until the time the loan is sold 
to manage this risk  we also utilize forward sales of tba mortgage backed securities 
during the period of the rate lock commitment and from the time a loan is closed with the borrowers and sold to investors  we remain exposed to basis execution  timing  and or volatility risk in that the changes in value of our hedges may not equal or completely offset the changes in value of the rate commitments being hedged 
this can result due to changes in the market demand for our mortgage loans brought about by supply and demand considerations and perceptions about credit risk relative to the agency securities 
we also mitigate counterparty risk by entering into commitments with proven counterparties and pre approved financial intermediaries 
the market value of irlcs is not readily ascertainable with precision because they are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
the bank determines the fair value of irlcs by measuring the change in the value of the underlying asset  while taking into consideration the probability that the irlcs will close 
information pertaining to the carrying amounts of our derivative financial instruments follows as of december dollars in thousands notional amount estimated fair value notional amount estimated fair value interest rate swaps interest rate lock commitments forward contracts to sell mortgage backed securities 
table of contents the interest rate swaps held in were connected to mariner finance borrowings 
changes in interest rates could materially affect the fair value of the irlcs or the forward commitments 
in the case of the loan related derivatives  fair value is also impacted by the probability that the irlcs will close fallout factor 
in addition  changes in interest rates could result in changes in the fallout factor  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
this is because the impact of an interest rate shift on the fallout ratio is nonsymmetrical and nonlinear 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation may be expected to have an impact on our operating costs and thus on net income 
a prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates  wages  and other costs to increase and could adversely affect our results of operations unless the fees we charge could be increased correspondingly 
our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of part ii of this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
we believe that the impact of inflation was not material for or recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
financial review for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million or per diluted share  a decrease of from a net loss of million or per diluted share in our gross revenue net interest income and noninterest income decreased million and our noninterest expenses  the provision for credit losses  and income taxes decreased by million 
our net interest income for decreased million or from  primarily due to lower yields on earning assets  higher levels of nonperforming assets  and a higher level of interest bearing liabilities  which more than offset the decrease in the rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the yield on average earning assets decreased from for to for and the rates on average interest bearing liabilities decreased from for to for rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities decreased due to decreased market interest rates 
the yields were also impacted by the increased level of nonperforming assets 
average earning assets remained relatively stable at billion in compared to billion for  while average interest bearing liabilities increased from the level of million to billion for our net interest margin decreased basis points to in compared to in our provision for loan losses increased to million in from million in our allowance for loan losses at december  represented of loans outstanding  an increase from december  of of loans outstanding 
we recognized net chargeoffs of million in compared to million in our total noninterest income decreased to million  due primarily to net otti charges recorded on certain investment securities  partially offset by an increase in total mortgage banking revenue  including gains on sales of mortgage loans  and gains on the sales of former branches 

table of contents mortgage banking revenue increased from million for to million for due to a larger volume of originations of loans  higher margins on loans sold  as well as increased values derived from rate lock commitments on loans in the mortgage loan pipeline 
deposit service charges declined to million in from million for due to lower overdraft income and to a decline in the number of accounts 
we recognized an  net trading loss during  compared to a net trading loss of  for  mainly due to declines in the value of borrowings accounted for at fair value 
these losses were partially offset by improved market values of trading assets of  brokerage fees decreased  during  as we realized lower mutual fund and annuity sales

hale  sr  who purchased trust preferred securities issued by mariner capital trust ii  mariner capital trust iv  and mariner capital trust viii 
mr 
hale  through the agreement with first mariner bancorp  has agreed to exchange million of the trust preferred securities for million in common stock of first mariner bancorp plus warrants to purchase shares equal to of the shares issued in the exchange the exchange 
mr 
hale purchased the trust preferred securities  which have an aggregate liquidation amount of million  for million 
upon completion of the agreed upon exchange  the company intends to cancel the million in trust preferred securities in exchange for common stock and warrants  eliminating this long term debt 
the exchange also will increase the company s total stockholders equity by approximately million  although the exact amount is subject to variation based on the valuation of the warrants at closing  from the cancellation of the trust preferred securities  the common securities and the 
table of contents subordinated debentures 
the exchange would be recorded during the quarter in which the trust preferred securities were cancelled  which is expected to be the first or second quarter of calendar year the aggregate number of shares of common stock to be exchanged the initial shares will be valued at million based on the average daily closing price of the common stock over the trading days prior to the closing of the transaction the conversion price 
in the event that by june  the company completes a public or private offering of its common stock at a price per share below the conversion price  then mr 
hale will be issued additional shares of common stock such that the total shares to be issued to mr 
hales would equal million divided by the price per share at which shares were sold in the public or private offering 
if common stock is sold in the rights offering see below at a price below the conversion price  the rights offering will result in the issuance of additional shares of common stock to mr 
hale 
mr 
hale also will receive warrants the a warrants to purchase in the aggregate of the initial shares 
in addition  mr 
hale will receive additional warrants the b warrants and  together with the a warrants  the warrants in the event that on or prior to june  first mariner bancorp enters into another agreement to acquire other trust preferred securities and the value of the consideration to be issued in that transaction relative to the aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities to be acquired is greater than the value of the consideration to be issued by first mariner bancorp in the exchange relative to the million aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities to be exchanged 
in that event  mr 
hale would receive additional warrants such that the relative value of the aggregate consideration to be paid in the exchange equals the relative value of the aggregate consideration to be paid in the subsequent transaction  provided that the number of shares subject to the b warrants could not exceed of the initial shares 
in the event mr 
hale s ownership of company common stock immediately following the closing would be equal to or greater than the threshold  assuming exercise of the a warrants  then the amount of trust preferred securities mr 
hale would exchange initially would be reduced by the minimum amount necessary so that immediately following the closing  mr 
hale s ownership of company common stock would be below the threshold 
if such a reduction occurs at the closing  the remaining trust preferred securities held by mr 
hale could be exchanged in the future subject to the terms of the exchange agreement assuming such exchange would not cause mr

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk results of operations for financial institutions  including us  may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  including declines in real estate values  rapid changes in interest rates and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
our loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in central maryland and portions of maryland s eastern shore and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with these local economies 
the united states has entered into an economic downturn 
the economic downturn generally  and the disruptions in the capital markets in particular  have decreased liquidity and increased our cost of debt and equity capital  where available 
the longer these conditions persist  the greater the probability that these factors could continue to increase our costs and significantly limit our access to debt and equity capital  and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
many of the customers to which we have made  or will make  loans may also be susceptible to the economic downturn  which may affect the ability of our customers to repay loans  thereby  increasing the level of our nonperforming assets 
the economic downturn may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans  as well as the value of our securities investments  which could affect our operations and financial results  as well as decrease our ability to borrow under our credit facilities or raise equity capital 
the economic downturn has affected the availability of credit generally and may prevent us from replacing or renewing our credit facilities on reasonable terms  if at all 
we do not know when market conditions will stabilize  if adverse conditions will intensify  or the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
also  it is possible that continued instability of the financial markets could have other  unforeseen material effects on our business 
we also face market risk related to interest rates that arises from our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is largely dependent on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets
