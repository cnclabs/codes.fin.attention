item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources debt equipment financing facilities ge business financial services inc if we require additional funds to support our capital programs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure a lender that will be willing to provide us funding or that we will be able to secure additional funding through the melf or other program of the commonwealth 
in addition  the aggregate amount of our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition  limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business 
our committed equity financing facilities may become unavailable to us if we do not comply with their conditions 
if we are unable to meet the conditions provided under the ceffs  we will not be able to issue any portion of the shares potentially available for issuance under the ceffs and therefore may not be able to use the ceffs to fund our activities  and the ceffs could expire without being fully utilized 
moreover  kingsbridge has the right under certain circumstances to terminate the ceffs  including in the event of a material adverse event 
in addition  even if we meet all the conditions provided under the ceffs  we are dependent upon the financial ability of kingsbridge to perform its obligations and purchase shares of our common stock under the ceffs 
any inability on our part to use at least one of the ceffs or any failure by kingsbridge to perform its obligations under the ceffs could have a material adverse effect upon us 
the market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock  like that of many other development stage pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  has been and is likely to be volatile 
in addition to general economic  political and market conditions  the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors  including announcements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors  patient adverse reactions to drug products  governmental approvals  delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency concerns regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products  changes in the united states or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development  changes in the united states or foreign political environment and the passage of laws  including tax  environmental or other laws  affecting the product development business  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  including any third party challenges of our intellectual property rights  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates  conditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries  new accounting standards  and the occurrence of any of the risks described in these risk factors or elsewhere in this annual report on form k or our other public filings 
our common stock is listed for quotation on the nasdaq global market 
during the twelve month period ended december   the price of our common stock ranged from to 
we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile 
the average daily trading volume in our common stock varies significantly 
for the twelve month period ended december   the average daily trading volume in our common stock was approximately  shares and the average number of transactions per day was approximately  the instability observed in our daily volume and number of transactions per day may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market at prevailing prices 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies in our industry 
even if securities class actions that we may face in the future are ultimately determined to be meritless or unsuccessful  they involve substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which could negatively impact our business 
if we are unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of the nasdaq global market prior to june   our stock price may decline and our common stock may be subject to delisting from nasdaq 
if our stock were no longer listed on nasdaq  the liquidity of our securities would be impaired 
on december   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market indicating that for consecutive business days our common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share as required by nasdaq listing rule a 
under the nasdaq listing rules  if during the calendar days following the date of the notification  or prior to june   the closing bid price of our stock is at or above for a minimum of consecutive business days  we will regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and the common stock will continue to be eligible for listing on the nasdaq global market 
if we do not achieve compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by june   nasdaq will provide us with written notification that the common stock is subject to delisting 
we may  at that time  appeal nasdaq s determination to a nasdaq hearing panel 
such an appeal  if granted  would stay delisting until a ruling by the panel 
alternatively  if we are at that time in compliance with all initial listing standards for the nasdaq capital market other than the minimum bid price requirement  we could apply to transfer the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq capital market and thereby receive an additional grace period of days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
if our stock price does not exceed the minimum bid price of within the time frames set forth above  our common stock will be subject to delisting 
if our common stock were no longer listed on the nasdaq global market or the nasdaq capital market  investors might only be able to trade in the over the counter market in the pink sheets a quotation medium operated by pink otc markets inc or on the otc bulletin board of the financial industry regulatory authority  inc finra 
this would impair the liquidity of our securities not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price  which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity  but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in media coverage 
future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock  including pursuant to our ceffs  stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our common stock  could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders  cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 
we require significant additional capital to continue to execute our business plan and advance our research and development efforts 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
we may sell shares of our common stock in one or more transactions at prices that may be at a discount to the then current market value of our common stock and on such other terms and conditions as we may determine from time to time 
any such transaction could result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders 
if we sell shares of our common stock in more than one transaction  stockholders who purchase our common stock may be materially diluted by subsequent sales 
such sales could also cause a drop in the market price of our common stock 
the issuance of shares of our common stock under the ceffs has  and the issuance of shares upon exercise of the related warrants we issued to kingsbridge will have  a dilutive impact on our other stockholders and the issuance  or even potential issuance  of such shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  if we access the ceffs  we will issue shares of our common stock to kingsbridge at a discount from to  depending upon the market price to the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day  which will further dilute the interests of other stockholders 
see  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources committed equity financing facilities ceffs 
furthermore  to the extent that kingsbridge sells to third parties the shares of our common stock that we sell to kingsbridge under the ceffs  our stock price may decrease due to the additional selling pressure in the market 
the perceived risk of dilution from sales of stock to or by kingsbridge may cause holders of our common stock to sell their shares  or it may encourage short sales of our common stock or other similar transactions 
this could contribute to a decline in the stock price of our common stock 
we also filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec on form s file no 
on june  which was declared effective shortly thereafter for the proposed offering from time to time of up to million of our securities  including common stock  preferred stock  varying forms of debt and warrant securities  or any combination of the foregoing 
we have issued securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement on two prior occasions  including in february  and may do so again in the future in response to market conditions or other circumstances on terms and conditions that will be determined at such time 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
in addition  as of december   approximately i million shares of our common stock were reserved for potential issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants  ii million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans  and iii  shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our k plan 
the exercise of stock options and other securities could cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution 
moreover  holders of our stock options and warrants are likely to exercise them  if ever  at a time when we otherwise could obtain a price for the sale of our securities that is higher than the exercise price per security of the options or warrants 
such exercises  or the possibility of such exercises  may impede our efforts to obtain additional financing through the sale of additional securities or make such financing more costly 
it may also reduce the price of our common stock 
if  during the term of certain of our warrants  we declare or make any dividend or other distribution of our assets to holders of shares of our common stock  by way of return of capital or otherwise including any distribution of cash  stock or other securities  property or options by way of a dividend  spin off  reclassification  corporate rearrangement or other similar transaction  then the exercise price of such warrants may adjust downward and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants would increase 
as a result  we may be required to issue more shares of common stock than previously anticipated  which could result in further dilution of our existing stockholders 
directors  executive officers  principal stockholders and affiliated entities own a significant percentage of our capital stock  and they may make decisions that you do not consider to be in your best interest 
as of december   our directors  executive officers  principal stockholders and affiliated entities beneficially owned  in the aggregate  approximately seventeen percent of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock 
for the purpose of computing this amount  an affiliated entity includes any entity that is known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our issued and outstanding common stock 
as a result  if some or all of them acted together  they would have the ability to exert substantial influence over the election of our board of directors and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be favored by other stockholders 
this could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices 
our technology platform is based solely on our proprietary kl surfactant technology and capillary aerosolization technology 
our technology platform is based on the scientific rationale of using our kl surfactant technology and capillary aerosolization technology to treat life threatening respiratory disorders and to serve as the foundation for the development of novel respiratory therapies and products 
our business is dependent upon the successful development and approval of our drug product candidates and our drug device combination products based on these technologies 
any material problems with our technology platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  other companies could use our technology in competitive products 
even if we obtain patents to protect our products  those patents may not be sufficiently broad or they may expire and others could then compete with us 
we seek patent protection for our drug product candidates to prevent others from commercializing equivalent products in substantially less time and at substantially lower expense 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success will depend in part on our ability and that of parties from whom we license technology to successfully obtain patents  defend our patents and otherwise prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights  including our trade secrets 
the patent position of companies relying upon biotechnology is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
to date  the united states patent and trademark office uspto has not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in biotechnology patents or the degree of protection that these types of patents afford 
as a result  there are risks that we may not secure rights to products or processes that appear to be patentable 
we and the parties licensing technologies to us  have filed various united states and foreign patent applications with respect to the products and technologies under our development  and the uspto and foreign patent offices have issued patents with respect to our products and technologies 
these patent applications include international applications filed under the patent cooperation treaty 
our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties may not result in the uspto or foreign patent office issuing patents 
in addition  if patent rights covering our products are not sufficiently broad  they may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products and technologies 
furthermore  even if the uspto or foreign patent offices were to issue patents to us or our licensors  others may challenge the patents or circumvent the patents  or the patent office or the courts may invalidate the patents 
thus  any patents we own or license from or to third parties may not provide us any protection against competitors 
the patents that we hold also have a limited life 
we have licensed a series of patents for our kl surfactant technology from johnson johnson and its wholly owned subsidiary ortho pharmaceutical corporation ortho pharmaceutical  which are important  both individually and collectively  to our strategy of commercializing our kl surfactant products 
these patents  which include important kl composition of matter claims and relevant european patents  began to expire in november  and will expire on various dates ending in or  in some cases  possibly later 
of the patents that have expired  we have filed to extend our most important patent one year  with further extensions possible into for our aerosolized kl surfactant  we hold exclusive licenses in the united states and outside the united states to pmusa s capillary aerosolization technology for use with pulmonary surfactants for all respiratory diseases 
our exclusive license in the united states also extends to other non surfactant drugs to treat a wide range of pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions 
the capillary aerosolization technology patents expire on various dates beginning in may and ending in  or  in some cases  possibly later 
we have filed  and when possible and appropriate  will file  other patent applications with respect to our products and processes in the united states and in foreign countries 
we may not be able to develop enhanced or additional products or processes that will be patentable under patent law and  if we do enhance or develop additional products that we believe are patentable  additional patents may not be issued to us 
see also  if we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements  we could lose the rights to our products 
intellectual property rights of third parties could limit our ability to develop and market our products 
our commercial success also depends upon our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents or violating the proprietary rights of others 
in certain cases  the uspto keeps united states patent applications confidential while the applications are pending 
as a result  we cannot determine in advance what inventions third parties may claim in their pending patent applications 
we may need to defend or enforce our patent and license rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others through legal proceedings  which would be costly  unpredictable and time consuming 
even in proceedings where the outcome is favorable to us  they would likely divert substantial resources  including management time  from our other activities 
moreover  any adverse determination could subject us to significant liability or require us to seek licenses that third parties might not grant to us or might only grant at rates that diminish or deplete the profitability of our products 
an adverse determination could also require us to alter our products or processes or cease altogether any product sales or related research and development activities 
if we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements  we could lose the rights to our products 
we depend on licensing agreements with third parties to maintain the intellectual property rights to our products under development 
presently  we have licensed rights from johnson johnson  ortho pharmaceutical  pmusa and pmpsa 
these agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations to maintain our rights under these licensing agreements 
all of these agreements last either throughout the life of the patents or for a number of years after the first commercial sale of the relevant product 
in addition  we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us 
if we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner  we could lose the rights to our proprietary technology 
finally  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies 
licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights might not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we rely on confidentiality agreements that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce 
although we take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property  including the use of agreements relating to the non disclosure of our confidential information to third parties  as well as agreements that provide for disclosure and assignment to us of all rights to the ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them  such agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce 
we generally seek to enter into these types of agreements with consultants  advisors and research collaborators  however  to the extent that such parties apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects  disputes may arise concerning allocation of the related proprietary rights 
such disputes often involve significant expense and yield unpredictable results 
in addition  we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors or others 
despite the protective measures we employ  we still face the risk that agreements may be breached  agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach  our trade secrets or proprietary know how may otherwise become known  our competitors may independently develop similar technology  or our competitors may independently discover our proprietary information and trade secrets 
we depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
we are highly dependent upon the members of our executive management team and our directors  as well as our scientific advisory board members  consultants and collaborating scientists 
many of these people have been involved with us for many years  have played integral roles in our progress and we believe that they continue to provide value to us 
a loss of any of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on aspects of our business and clinical development and regulatory programs 
in august  dr 
capetola resigned his position with us as president and chief executive officer and a member of our board of directors 
our board elected w 
thomas amick  our chairman of the board  to act as chief executive officer for an interim period 
mr 
amick  who is otherwise employed by another biotech company as its chief executive officer  is able to devote only a portion of his time to his duties as our interim chief executive officer 
until such time as we employ a full time chief executive officer  our dependency on the remaining members of our management team to exhibit strong leadership skills and effectively manage our operations is increased 
while we expect that  once we have secured sufficient strategic and financial resources to support the continuing development of our kl surfactant technology and support our operations  we will seek to attract candidates to lead our management team  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in that endeavor 
as of december   we had employment agreements with officers that expire in may these agreements provide for automatic one year renewal at the end of each term  unless otherwise terminated by either party 
in february  we provided notice of non renewal with respect to all but the agreements that we maintain with the following officers chief financial officer  general counsel  and the senior officers in charge of manufacturing  corporate development  and human resources 
the employment of the officers whose agreements will not be renewed were not terminated and they will remain as at will employees and  in lieu of the benefits provided under their employment agreements  will be entitled to certain severance benefits 
the loss of services from these executives could significantly adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
we may experience intense competition for qualified personnel and the existence of non competition agreements between prospective employees and their former employers may prevent us from hiring those individuals or subject us to lawsuits brought by their former employers 
while we attempt to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel  many of our competitors have greater resources and more experience than we  making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel 
our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors  which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological innovation and evolving industry standards 
we compete with numerous existing companies intensely in many ways 
we intend to market our products under development for the treatment of diseases for which other technologies and treatments are rapidly developing and  consequently  we expect new companies to enter our industry and that competition in the industry will increase 
many of these companies have substantially greater research and development  manufacturing  marketing  financial  technological  personnel and managerial resources than we have 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals or products  and manufacturing and marketing products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda or comparable foreign approval or commercializing products before us 
if we commence commercial product sales  we will compete against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities that may successfully develop and commercialize products that are more effective or less expensive than ours 
these are areas in which  as yet  we have limited or no experience 
in addition  developments by our competitors may render our drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive 
we also face  and will continue to face  competition from colleges  universities  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations 
these competitors frequently aggressively seek patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed 
some of these technologies may compete directly with the technologies that we are developing 
these institutions will also compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel 
we expect that therapeutic developments in the areas in which we are active may occur at a rapid rate and that competition will intensify as advances in this field are made 
as a result  we need to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to research and development activities 
if product liability claims are brought against us  it may result in reduced demand for our products or damages that exceed our insurance coverage and we may incur substantial costs 
the clinical testing  marketing and use of our products exposes us to product liability claims if the use or misuse of our products causes injury  disease or results in adverse effects 
use of our products in clinical trials  as well as commercial sale  if approved  could result in product liability claims 
in addition  sales of our products through third party arrangements could also subject us to product liability claims 
we presently carry product liability insurance with annual coverage of up to million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
however  this insurance coverage includes various deductibles  limitations and exclusions from coverage  and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims 
we may need to obtain additional product liability insurance coverage  including by locally authorized insurers licensed in countries where we conduct our clinical trials  before initiating clinical trials 
we expect to obtain product liability insurance coverage before commercializing any of our drug product candidates  however  such insurance is expensive and may not be available when we need it 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance  with acceptable limits and retentions  at an acceptable cost 
any product liability claim  even one that is within the limits of our insurance coverage or one that is meritless and or unsuccessful  could adversely affect the availability or cost of insurance generally and our cash available for other purposes  such as research and development 
in addition  such claims could result in uninsured expenses related to defense or payment of substantial monetary awards to claimants  a decrease in demand for our drug product candidates  damage to our reputation  and an inability to complete clinical trial programs or to commercialize our drug product candidates  if approved 
moreover  the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock 
our corporate compliance program cannot ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations affecting our activities in the jurisdictions in which we may sell our products  if approved  and a failure to comply with such regulations or prevail in litigation related to noncompliance could harm our business 
many of our activities  including the research  development  manufacture  sale and marketing of our products  are subject to extensive laws and regulation  including without limitation  health care fraud and abuse laws  such as the federal false claims act  the federal anti kickback statute  and other state and federal laws and regulations 
we have developed and implemented a corporate compliance policy and oversight program based upon what we understand to be current industry best practices  but we cannot assure you that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations 
if any such investigations  actions or lawsuits are instituted against us  and if we are not successful in defending or disposing of them without liability  such investigations  actions or lawsuits could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions and could otherwise have a significant impact on our business 
we expect to face uncertainty over reimbursement and healthcare reform 
in both the united states and other countries  sales of our products will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payers  which include governmental health administration authorities  managed care providers and private health insurers 
third party payers increasingly challenge the price and examine the cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
moreover  the current political environment in the united states and abroad may result in the passage of significant legislation that could  among other things  restructure the markets in which we operate and restrict pricing strategies of drug development companies 
if  for example  price restrictions were placed on the distribution of our drugs  we may be forced to curtail development of our pipeline products and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
even if we succeed in commercializing our drug products  uncertainties regarding health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in quantities or at prices that will enable us to achieve profitability 
to obtain reimbursement from a third party payer  it must determine that our drug product is a covered benefit under its health plan  which is likely to require a determination that our product is safe  effective and medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient  cost effective  and neither experimental nor investigational 
obtaining a determination that a product is a covered benefit may be a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data about our products to each payer 
we may not be able to provide sufficient data to gain coverage 
even when a payer determines that a product is covered  the payer may impose limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
moreover  coverage does not imply that any product will be covered in all cases or that reimbursement will be available at a rate that would permit a health care provider to cover its costs of using our product 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our amended and restated by laws  our shareholder rights agreement and delaware law could defer a change of our management and thereby discourage or delay offers to acquire us 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our amended and restated by laws  our shareholder rights agreement and delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management  and might discourage a third party from offering to acquire us  even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
as a result  our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation  the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares  together with a premium  before the redemption of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  could issue large blocks of preferred stock 
we have adopted a shareholder rights agreement  which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors thereby discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the shareholder rights agreement would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
the failure to prevail in litigation or the costs of litigation  including securities class action and patent claims  could harm our financial performance and business operations 
we are potentially susceptible to litigation 
for example  as a public company  we may be subject to claims asserting violations of securities laws 
even if such actions are found to be without merit  the potential impact of such actions  which generally seek unquantified damages and attorneys fees and expenses  is uncertain 
there can be no assurance that an adverse result in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have from time to time been involved in disputes and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including in connection with the conduct of clinical trials 
such claims  with or without merit  if not resolved  could be time consuming and result in costly litigation 
although we believe such claims are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  it is impossible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of such claims and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any proceeding to which we may be a party 
in addition  as the uspto keeps united states patent applications confidential in certain cases while the applications are pending  we cannot ensure that our products or methods do not infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are applied for and issued  the risk increases that our patents or patent applications for our kl surfactant product candidates may give rise to a declaration of interference by the uspto  or to administrative proceedings in foreign patent offices  or that our activities lead to claims of patent infringement by other companies  institutions or individuals 
these entities or persons could bring legal proceedings against us seeking to invalidate our patents  obtain substantial damages or enjoin us from conducting research and development activities

item properties 
we maintain our principal executive offices at kelly road  suite  warrington  pennsylvania  which consists of  square feet of space that we lease at an annual rent of approximately million 
in april  the lease  which originally expired in february with total aggregate payments of million  was extended through february  with additional payments of million over the three year extension period 
we do not own any real property 
in october  we completed construction of an analytical and development laboratory within our warrington  pennsylvania headquarters location 
our analytical testing activities predominantly involve release and stability testing of raw materials as well as commercial and clinical drug product supply 
we also perform at this location development work with respect to our aerosolized kl surfactant and novel formulations of our product candidates 
in february  we completed construction of a new medical device development laboratory within our warrington  pennsylvania headquarters location that will support the further development of our capillary aerosolization systems 
the facility includes capabilities to assemble disposable dose packets in a controlled environment in two class  hoods following clean room procedures 
we also use this laboratory for component parts and finished assembly inspection and storage 
having this new laboratory greatly enhances our ability to leverage our internal development engineering resources and manage ongoing preclinical development activities for aerosurf  while at the same time controlling the related expense and conserving our financial resources 
we lease approximately  square feet of space for our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey  at an annual rent of  this space is specifically designed for the manufacture and filling of sterile pharmaceuticals in compliance with cgmp and is our only manufacturing facility 
the lease for our totowa facility expires in december in addition to customary terms and conditions  the lease is subject to the landlord s right  upon two years prior notice  to terminate the lease early 
this early termination right is subject to certain conditions  including that the master tenant  a related party of the landlord  must have ceased all activities at the premises  and  depending upon the timing of the notice  if we satisfy certain financial conditions  the landlord would be obligated to make early termination payments to us 
at the present time  we understand that the master tenant continues to be active in the premises 
as this early termination option could require us to move out of our totowa facility as early as march  we are developing a long term manufacturing strategy that includes i potentially renegotiating our current lease to amend the termination and other provisions  ii building or acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities to support product development and  if approved  commercial production of our kl surfactant product candidates  and iii potentially using contract manufacturers

our discussion is organized as follows company overview and business strategy this section provides a general description of our company and business plans 
critical accounting policies this section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require the exercise of judgment and use of estimates on the part of management in their application 
in addition  all of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies and estimates  are discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  including comparisons of the results for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources this section provides a discussion on our capital resources  future capital requirements  cash flows  committed equity financing facilities  historical financing transactions  outstanding debt arrangements and commitments 
overview discovery laboratories  inc referred to as we  us  or the company is a biotechnology company developing our novel kl proprietary technology  which produces a synthetic  peptide containing surfactant kl surfactant that is structurally similar to pulmonary surfactant  a substance produced naturally in the lung and essential for survival and normal respiratory function 
in addition  our proprietary capillary aerosol generating technology capillary aerosolization technology produces a dense aerosol with a defined particle size  to potentially deliver our aerosolized kl surfactant to the lung 
as many respiratory disorders are associated with surfactant deficiency or surfactant degradation  we believe that our proprietary technology platform makes it possible  for the first time  to develop a significant pipeline of surfactant products targeted to treat a wide range of respiratory problems 
we are developing our lead products  surfaxin lucinactant  surfaxin ls and aerosurf  to address the most significant respiratory conditions affecting pediatric populations 
our research and development efforts are currently focused on the management of rds in premature infants 
we believe that the rds market represents a significant opportunity from both a medical and a business perspective 
we further believe that surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf  have the potential to greatly improve the management of rds and  collectively  represent the opportunity  over time  to significantly expand the current rds worldwide annual market 
in addition to our lead products  we plan over time to develop our kl surfactant technology into a broad product pipeline that potentially will address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions for which there currently are no or few approved therapies  in patient populations ranging from premature infants to adults 
our kl surfactant is in clinical development to potentially address pediatric patients with acute respiratory failure arf and patients with cystic fibrosis cf 
we are conducting research and preclinical development with our kl surfactant potentially to address acute lung injury ali  and  potentially in the future  other diseases associated with inflammation of the lung  such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 
we have also initiated exploratory preclinical studies to assess the feasibility of using our kl surfactant in combination with small and large molecule therapeutics to efficiently and effectively deliver therapies to the lung to treat a range of pulmonary conditions and disease 
an important priority is to secure strategic and financial resources to potentially maximize the inherent value in our kl surfactant technology 
we would prefer to accomplish our objectives through strategic alliances 
with respect to our lead products  we are actively engaged in discussions with potential strategic and or financial partners  although there can be no assurance that any strategic alliance or other financing transaction will be successfully concluded 
with respect to our early stage exploratory programs  our plans include potentially taking these initiatives through a phase proof of concept phase and  if successful  thereafter determining whether to seek strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements or to utilize other financial alternatives to fund their further development 
we have focused our current resources on our lead products  primarily to address the requirements to gain the potential approval of surfaxin in the united states 
until such time as we secure sufficient strategic and financial resources to support the continuing development of our kl surfactant technology and support our operations  we will continue to conserve our resources  predominantly by curtailing and pacing investments in our pipeline programs 
the reader is referred to  and encouraged to read in its entirety item business of this annual report on form k  which contains a discussion of our business and business strategy  as well as information concerning our proprietary technologies and our current and planned kl pipeline programs 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
in february  we completed a public offering resulting in gross proceeds of million million net 
also  as of december   our million loan with quintiles is classified as a current liability  payable in april we are pursuing a potential strategic restructuring of this loan however  there can be no assurance that any such restructuring will occur 
currently  under our two committed equity financing facilities ceffs  we may potentially raise subject to certain conditions  including minimum stock price and volume limitations up to an aggregate of million 
however  as of march   neither ceff was available because the market price of our common stock price was below the minimum price required to utilize the facility 
during  we raised aggregate gross proceeds of million 
in may  we completed a registered direct public offering in resulting in gross proceeds of million million net  and  throughout  we raised an aggregate of million from draw downs under our ceffs 
see  committed equity financing facilities ceffs  and financings pursuant to common stock offerings 
our future capital requirements depend upon many factors  including the success of our efforts to secure one or more strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements to support our product development activities and  if approved  commercialization plans 
we are currently focused on developing our lead kl surfactant products  surfaxin ls  aerosurf and surfaxin  to address the most significant respiratory conditions affecting pediatric populations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure strategic partners or collaborators to support and advise our activities  that our research and development projects will be successful  that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory approval  that any approved product will be commercially viable  that any ceff will be available for future financings  or that we will be able to obtain additional capital when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition to multiple strategic alternatives  we continue to consider potential additional financings and other similar opportunities to meet our capital requirements and continue our operations 
even if we succeed in securing strategic alliances  raising additional capital and developing and subsequently commercializing product candidates  we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
for further discussion of our accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in part iv to this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition under strategic alliances and collaboration agreements revenue under strategic alliances and our collaboration agreements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
grant revenue is recorded upon receipt of funds 
research and development expenses research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with our personnel  facilities  manufacturing operations  formulation development  research  clinical  regulatory  other preclinical and clinical activities and medical affairs 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
results of operations the net loss for the years ended december   and was million or per share  million or per share  and million or per share  respectively 
included in the net loss for the years ended december   and were stock based compensation expenses of million or per share  million or per share  and million or per share  respectively 
revenue the company did not record any revenues in and in march  we restructured our december strategic alliance with philip morris usa inc pmusa  d b a chrysalis technologies chrysalis  and assumed full responsibility from chrysalis for the further development of the capillary aerosolization technology 
as part of the restructuring  chrysalis completed a technology transfer to us  provided development support through june   and also paid us million to support our future development activities  which we recognized as revenue in see  item business licensing  patents and other proprietary rights and regulatory designations patents and proprietary rights philip morris usa inc and philip morris products sa research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
these costs are charged to operations as incurred and are tracked by category  as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  research and development expenses manufacturing development development operations direct pre clinical and clinical programs total research and development expenses for a description of the clinical programs included in research and development  see surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine 
manufacturing development manufacturing development includes the cost of our manufacturing operations  quality assurance and analytical chemistry capabilities to assure adequate production of clinical and potential commercial drug supply for our kl surfactant products  in conformance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
these costs include employee expenses  facility related costs  depreciation  costs of drug substances including raw materials  supplies  quality control and assurance activities and analytical services  etc 
additionally  in costs included activities to address issues identified in an approvable letter that we received from the fda with respect to surfaxin in may may approvable letter 
the decrease in manufacturing development expenses in as compared to is primarily due to our efforts in to conserve financial resources following receipt of the april complete response letter 
the increase in manufacturing development expenses in as compared to is primarily due to i expenditures in to support our quality assurance and analytical chemistry capabilities  including implementation and validation of analytical methods and quality testing of drug product for our development programs  ii activities related to preparation of the complete response to the may approvable letter  and iii purchases of active ingredients for the production of surfaxin 
manufacturing development expenses included charges of million  million and million associated with stock based employee compensation for the years ended december    and  respectively 
development operations development operations includes i medical  scientific  clinical  regulatory  data management and biostatistics activities in support of our kl surfactant development programs  ii medical affairs activities to provide scientific and medical education support in connection with our kl surfactant technology pipeline programs  iii design and development for the manufacture of our novel capillary aerosolization systems  including an aerosol generating device  the disposable dose delivery packets and patient interface system necessary to administer aerosurf for our planned phase clinical trials and  iv pharmaceutical development activities  including development of a lyophilized dry powder formulation of our kl surfactant 
these costs include personnel  expert consultants  outside services to support regulatory  data management and device development activities  symposiums at key neonatal medical meetings  facilities related costs  and other costs for the management of clinical trials 
the decrease in development operations expenses in as compared to is primarily due to our efforts in to conserve financial resources and limit investment in our kl respiratory pipeline programs following receipt of the april complete response letter 
the decrease in development operations expenses in as compared to is primarily due to cost reductions resulting from the relocation of our analytical testing and pharmaceutical development activities previously performed at our laboratories located in doylestown  pennsylvania  and mountain view  california  and consolidation of those activities into our new laboratory space in warrington  pennsylvania  in the fourth quarter of the decrease in from was partially offset by expenditures in associated with our medical affairs capabilities  including medical science liaisons and symposiums at key pediatric medical meetings in anticipation of the potential approval and commercial launch of surfaxin in may expenses associated with medical affairs activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
development operations expenses included charges of million  million and million associated with stock based employee compensation for the years ended december    and  respectively 
direct pre clinical and clinical programs direct pre clinical and clinical programs include i pre clinical activities  including toxicology studies and other pre clinical studies to obtain data to support potential investigational new drug ind and nda filings for our product candidates  ii activities associated with conducting human clinical trials  including patient enrollment costs  external site costs  clinical drug supply and related external costs such as contract research consultant fees and expenses  iii activities related to addressing the items identified in the april complete response letter  and iv activities related to preparation of the complete responses submitted in november and october  respectively to an approvable letter received from the fda with respect to surfaxin in april april approvable letter and the may approvable letter 
direct pre clinical and clinical programs expenses in included i costs associated with activities to address issues identified in the april complete response letter  ii activities associated with the ongoing phase clinical trial evaluating the use of surfaxin in children up to two years of age suffering with arf  and iii pre clinical and preparatory activities for anticipated phase clinical trials for surfaxin ls and aerosurf for rds in premature infants 
direct pre clinical and clinical programs expenses in and included i costs associated with preparation of the complete responses to the may approvable letter and the april approvable letter  ii activities associated with the ongoing phase clinical trial evaluating the use of surfaxin in children up to two years of age suffering with arf  and iii pre clinical and preparatory activities for anticipated phase clinical trials for aerosurf for rds in premature infants 
the decrease in expenses in as compared to is primarily due to our efforts to conserve financial resources following receipt of the may approvable letter 
the decrease in direct pre clinical and clinical program expenses in compared to and is primarily due to our efforts to conserve financial resources and limit our investment in research and development programs in anticipation of potentially securing a strategic or financial alternative to fund our research and development activities 
research and development expenses by category we also track our research and development expenses in major categories as shown in the following table salaries benefits contracted services rents utilities depreciation raw materials supplies stock based compensation all other total year to year changes in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation generally reflect changes in the size and mix of our employee base over time 
in the second half of  we increased our workforce in anticipation of the potential commercial launch of surfaxin in and  with the prospect of generating revenues  a potential acceleration of our investment in our pipeline programs 
we maintained our employee base at approximately the same level throughout following receipt of the april complete response letter for surfaxin  we reduced our workforce and restructured certain functions in research and development  primarily medical affairs 
see  results of operations general and administrative expenses 
contracted services include the cost of pre clinical studies  clinical trial activities  certain components our manufacturing operations  quality control and analytical testing of our drug product  biological activity testing  consulting services  aerosol device design and engineering services  etc 
contracted services decreased over the three year period primarily due to limiting our investment in our kl pipeline programs to conserve financial resources following receipt of the may approvable letter 
rents and utilities are associated with our leased manufacturing  laboratory and related facilities  including our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey 
the decrease in rents and utilities over the three year period is due to termination of leases for office and analytical laboratory space in doylestown  pennsylvania  and mountain view  california  in mid the activities performed at these locations were consolidated in the fourth quarter of into our new analytical and development laboratory at corporate headquarters at  in warrington  pennsylvania 
depreciation is associated with manufacturing and laboratory equipment  as well as leasehold improvements at our manufacturing operations in totowa and our laboratories and related space at our headquarters in warrington  pennsylvania 
the increase in depreciation from to is associated with investments made to complete the new analytical and development laboratory in warrington  pennsylvania  at the end of approximately  of depreciation in and represents a full year of depreciation with respect to the new laboratory 
the decline from to is due to our limiting purchases of equipment during and to conserve financial resources 
in addition  certain older assets became fully depreciated in this period  resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense 
raw materials and supplies consist of purchases of our active pharmaceutical ingredients for the manufacture of our kl product candidates and supplies to support our manufacturing and laboratory operations  including component parts for the disposable dose delivery packets and patient interface system necessary to administer aerosurf via our novel capillary aerosolization systems 
all other includes the cost of employee travel  insurances  shipping and taxes 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of executive management  business and commercial development  finance and accounting  intellectual property and legal  human resources  information technology  facility and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses included charges of million  million and million associated with stock based employee compensation for the years ended december    and  respectively 
expenses for pre launch commercial activities for the years ended december   and and were  million  and million  respectively 
a significant component of and general and administrative expenses is associated with pre launch commercial activities to prepare for the potential approval and commercial launch of surfaxin in may these activities began in the second half of and were accelerated in early up to receipt of the may approvable letter 
following receipt of the may approvable letter  we scaled back our commercial activities 
throughout the remainder of and into  we made limited investments in our commercial capabilities in anticipation of the potential approval of surfaxin in the united states 
following receipt of the april complete response letter  we have reassessed our business strategy and have curtailed investment in commercial capabilities 
we no longer plan to establish our own specialty pulmonary commercial organization to launch our kl surfactant products in the unites states and are now seeking to enter into strategic alliances to support our research and development programs and  if approved  to commercialize our products in all markets  including the united states 
although we are actively engaged in discussions with potential strategic and or financial partners  there can be no assurance that any strategic alliance or other financing transaction will be successfully concluded 
in addition  following receipt in april complete response letter  to conserve our cash resources  we implemented cost containment measures and reduced our workforce from to employees 
the workforce reduction was focused primarily in our commercial and corporate administrative groups 
we incurred a one time charge of million million in general and administrative expenses and million in research and development expenses in related to the workforce reduction 
as of december   we had full time employees  the majority of which are devoted to research and development 
we believe our existing general and administrative resources  including legal  finance  business development  information technologies  human resources and general management capabilities  are sufficient to support our business operations for the foreseeable future 
we may make additional investments in the future to enhance these capabilities as and when required to meet the needs of our business 
to sustain and perfect our potential competitive position  we expect to invest in maintaining our existing patent portfolio  trademarks  trade secrets and regulatory exclusivity designations  including potential orphan drug and new drug product exclusivities  and when appropriate  patent extensions  new patents  new trademarks  and new regulatory exclusivity designations  when available 
see  item business licensing  patents and other proprietary rights and regulatory designations 
other income expense other income expense  net was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  as summarized in the chart below dollars in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense other income expense other income expense  net interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and marketable securities 
the decrease in interest income in and is due to a general decline in market interest rates and in our average cash and marketable securities balance 
interest expense consists of interest accrued on the outstanding balance of our loan with quintiles and under our equipment financing facilities 
in addition  interest expense includes million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs for warrants issued to quintiles in october as consideration for restructuring our loan in the decrease in interest expense in and is due to a decline in the variable interest rate on our quintiles loan  which is equal to the us prime rate 
other income expenses primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of our commonwealth of pennsylvania research and development tax credits of  million  and million for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease in proceeds from the sale of these tax credits is due to more credits being available for sale in and as compared to liquidity and capital resources we have incurred substantial losses since inception due to investments in research and development  manufacturing and potential commercialization activities and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses over the next several years 
historically  we have funded our business operations through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  draw downs under our ceffs  capital equipment and debt facilities  and strategic alliances 
we expect to continue to fund our business operations through a combination of these sources  as well as sales revenue from our product candidates  beginning with surfaxin for the prevention of rds  if approved 
following receipt of the april complete response letter for surfaxin  we made fundamental changes in our business strategy 
we now believe that it is in our best interest financially to seek to develop and commercialize our kl technology through strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements 
however  there can be no assurance that any strategic alliance or other arrangement will be successfully concluded 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as a result of our cash position as of december   the audit opinion we received from our independent auditors  which is included in our financial statements in this report  contains a notation related to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital  to fund our research and development and commercial programs and meet our obligations on a timely basis 
if we are unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital  through strategic and collaborative arrangements with potential partners and or future debt and equity financings  we will likely not have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to fund our business operations  which could significantly limit our ability to continue as a going concern 
in that event  we may be forced to further limit development of many  if not all  of our programs and consider other means of creating value for our stockholders  such as licensing the development and or commercialization of products that we consider valuable and might otherwise plan to develop ourselves 
if we are unable to raise the necessary capital  we may be forced to curtail all of our activities and  ultimately  cease operations 
even if we are able to raise additional capital  such financings may only be available on unattractive terms  or could result in significant dilution of stockholders interests and  in such event  the market price of our common stock may decline 
our december  financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence 
our future capital requirements depend upon many factors  including the success of our efforts to secure one or more strategic alliances to support our product development activities and commercialization plans  and the ultimate success of our product development and commercialization plans 
currently  we are focused on developing our lead kl surfactant products to address the most significant respiratory conditions affecting pediatric populations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure strategic partners to support our activities  that our research and development projects will be successful  that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory approval  that any approved product will be commercially viable  that any ceff will be available for future financings  or that we will be able to obtain additional capital when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition to multiple strategic alternatives  we continue to consider potential additional financings and other similar opportunities to meet our capital requirements and continue our operations 
even if we succeed in raising additional capital and developing and subsequently commercializing product candidates  we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
in february  we completed a public offering resulting in gross proceeds of million million net 
also  as of december   our million loan with quintiles is classified as a current liability  payable in april we are pursuing a potential strategic restructuring of this loan however  there can be no assurance that any such restructuring will occur 
currently  under our two ceffs  we may potentially raise subject to certain conditions  including minimum stock price and volume limitations up to an aggregate of million 
however  as of march   neither the may ceff nor the december ceff was available because the market price of our common stock was below the minimum price required and  respectively to utilize the facility 
during  we raised aggregate gross proceeds of million 
in may  we completed a registered direct public offering in resulting in gross proceeds of million million net  and  throughout  we raised an aggregate of million from draw downs under our ceffs 
see  committed equity financing facilities ceffs  and financings pursuant to common stock offerings 
to meet our capital requirements  we continue to consider multiple strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to potential business alliances  commercial and development partnerships  additional financings and other similar opportunities  although there can be no assurance that we will take any further specific actions or enter into any transactions 
until such time as we secure the necessary capital  we plan to continue conserving our financial resources  predominantly by limiting investments in our pipeline programs 
see  item a risk factors we will require significant additional capital to continue our planned research and development activities and continue to operate as a going concern 
moreover  such additional financing could result in equity dilution  and the terms of our indebtedness may impair our ability to conduct our business  future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock  including pursuant to our ceffs  stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our common stock  could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders  cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 
cash flows we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the decrease of million in is primarily due to million used in operating activities  capital expenditures and principal payments on equipment loans  partially offset by proceeds of million from financings under our ceffs and million from our may registered direct offering 
see  committed equity financing facilities ceffs  and financings pursuant to common stock offerings 
cash flows used in operating activities cash flows used in operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash flows used in operating activities are a result of our net operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses associated with stock based compensation  depreciation and changes in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
see  results of operations 
cash flows from operating activities in also include million received from chrysalis to support development of our capillary aerosolization technology 
cash flows from used in investing activities cash flows from used in investing activities include capital expenditures of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures were primarily for laboratory and manufacturing equipment to support analytical  quality  manufacturing and development activities 
in  we completed construction of a new analytical and development laboratory in our headquarters in warrington  pennsylvania  for a total cost of approximately million and consolidated at this location the analytical  quality and development activities previously conducted at locations in doylestown  pennsylvania  and mountain view  california 
the new laboratory expanded our capabilities by providing additional capacity to conduct analytical testing as well as opportunities to exploit our internal professional expertise across a broad range of projects  improving both operational efficiency and financial economics 
the leases for our doylestown  pennsylvania  and mountain view  california  locations either expired or terminated in see  contractual obligations 
cash flows from used in investing activities also include cash used to purchase short term marketable securities and cash received from the sale and or maturity of short term marketable securities 
when assessing our cash position and managing our liquidity and capital resources  we do not consider cash flows between cash and marketable securities to be meaningful 
cash used to purchase marketable securities is subject to an investment policy that is approved by the board of directors and provides for the purchase of high quality marketable securities  while ensuring preservation of capital and fulfillment of liquidity needs 
as of december   the company did not have any available for sale marketable securities 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  as summarized in the chart below in millions year ended december  financings under ceffs financings pursuant to common stock offerings proceeds from equipment financing facilities debt service payments cash flows from financing activities  net the following sections provide a more detailed discussion of our cash flows from financing activities 
committed equity financing facilities ceffs we have entered into four committed equity financing facilities ceffs with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge  a private investment group  under which kingsbridge is committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  newly issued shares of our common stock 
the ceffs allow us  at our discretion  to raise capital at the time and in amounts deemed suitable to us  to support our business plans 
we are not obligated to utilize any of the funds available under the ceffs 
each ceff is available for a period of two or three years from inception 
should we choose to utilize any of the ceffs  our ability to access the funds available under the ceffs is subject to certain conditions  including stock price and volume limitations 
as of december   we had two ceffs available for future financings as follows the ceff dated december  december ceff and the ceff dated may  may ceff 
a third ceff entered in april expired on may  and is no longer available

 the first day of draw down to initiate a draw down  the closing price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first trading day of the draw down period must be at least equal to the minimum price set forth above 
if on any trading day  the daily volume weighted average of our common stock vwap is less than the minimum vwap set forth above  no shares are purchased on that trading day and the aggregate amount that we originally designated for the overall draw down is reduced for each such day by th in the case of the december ceff  and th in the case of the may ceff  respectively 
unless we and kingsbridge agree otherwise  a minimum of three trading days must elapse between the expiration of any draw down pricing period and the beginning of the next draw down pricing period 
each draw down is limited in amount as follows may ceff the lesser of percent of the closing price market value of the outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of the draw down or million  and december ceff the lesser of percent of the closing price market value of the outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of the draw down or million 
the purchase price of shares sold to kingsbridge under the ceffs is at a discount to the vwap as defined in the applicable agreement for each of the trading days following our initiation of a draw down under the ceff  as follows daily vwap of vwap applicable discount may ceff greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than or equal to per share december ceff greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than or equal to per share less than or equal to but greater than or equal to 
in addition  kingsbridge may terminate the ceffs under certain circumstances  including if a material adverse event relating to our business continues for trading days after notice of the material adverse event
