item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide intelligent robotics systems  the core of which are our motion controls systems  integrated vision guidance technology and application software  which are sold in combination with our own proprietary robot mechanisms 
our vision guidance technology is tightly integrated with our motion controls technology  and this is a key differentiator for adept 
with our acquisition of mobilerobots inc  we also have autonomous robot and fleet management capabilities that extend our value proposition to additional markets 
in addition  we provide a full complement of robotics services and support for our customers 
through sales to system integrators  oem partners and end user companies  we sell our robotics systems and services into a few broad industries where we believe we can provide the best solutions for particular applications 
strategy our strategy focuses on a few specific industries where the use of automation is growing or is expected to grow over the long term and where we can provide significant product differentiation 
the industries we have selected are packaging  medical  disk drive electronics and solar 
currently  we are focusing the majority of our investments on the global packaging market  where new applications have continued to emerge even during the last two years of economic weakness and where our quattro robot has been well received 
while we believe that the packaging market provides the greatest growth opportunity for us in the near term  we are also investing in the medical and solar markets  although at a less aggressive pace  to ensure we are able to participate in these opportunities as they develop 
additionally  we continue to address our sales efforts towards our traditional markets  such as the disk drive industry and the german automotive electronics and industrial markets  where our products are well positioned and we believe significant long term opportunity exists 
while capital spending in the disk drive market increased during fiscal  we expect this trend of increased spending to slow during fiscal in the us  we believe that near term growth will be driven primarily by the packaging market and longer term by additional target markets including medical 
much of the demand for our products in the last few years has come from europe  although the economic downturn has constricted growth in this region over the last several quarters 
we believe europe will continue to be an important long term market for our products  both in traditional sectors such as automotive electronics and industrial  and in our target growth markets  including packaging and solar 
over the last year  we have experienced significant growth in asia  as the disk drive market has been in an active investment cycle 
we expect that asia will continue to be an important growth region for us in the disk drive electronics and solar industries  although both markets will likely continue to experience significant variations in activity over time due to the cyclical nature of this industry 
included in our growth strategy is an ongoing search for possible companies  product lines or technologies for acquisition 
our focus is on pursuing acquisitions that would broaden our solutions capabilities  further strengthen our position in key markets  increase our revenues and expand our operational scale 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired mobilerobots inc mri  a provider of autonomous robot and automated guided vehicle technologies 
trends in our business the impact of continued global economic downturn and uncertainty on our business was much less pronounced in fiscal than it had been the previous year 
while sales to our traditional automotive and industrial markets continued to reflect weak demand and accounted for only of our business compared to in fiscal  we experienced significant increases in certain of our target growth markets 
sales to the disk drive and consumer electronics markets grew approximately year over year and accounted for approximately of our total 
table of contents revenues in fiscal compared with the prior year  as manufacturers ramped up their capital spending following several years of a low investment cycle 
sales of our quattro robot and other packaging solutions for food  cosmetics and pharmaceutical packaging applications increased approximately year over year and accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  compared with in fiscal orders for our quattro robot have continued to increase over the past several quarters and were the highest to date in the third and fourth quarters of we also experienced growth of approximately in sales to the solar market in  but from a much smaller revenue base 
because of the resurgence of investment in the disk drive and consumer electronics markets  orders shipped to asia grew nearly and accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal compared with in fiscal additionally  we received our first quattro orders in asia for packaging and solar applications during the year  which we believe is indicative of the strong and diverse market opportunity in this region 
european sales accounted for approximately of revenue in fiscal  down from in fiscal as a result of decreased demand from the automotive electronics in germany and from the industrial markets in germany and the uk 
in germany  this was offset by increased sales to the packaging market  so that revenues in germany increased nearly in fiscal compared with the prior year 
during the same period  sales in france decreased approximately due to the timing of customer orders 
sales in the us accounted for of total revenue in fiscal  compared with in fiscal  reflecting a slowdown in customer manufacturing and capital investment as a result of the economic downturn  as well as a shift in the location of purchasing decisions related to the disk drive industry during the year  from the us to asia 
these factors were partially offset by increased sales of our quattro robots and other solutions for applications in the packaging market 
we believe we are well positioned in the disk drive market and during we achieved new design wins that we expect will result in additional orders in the future 
while it is difficult to predict the timing of investment cycles within the disk drive industry  the current capital investment cycle appears to be continuing and we expect that this market will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales in fiscal the cost of sales of our disk drive products is higher than our corporate average  and we expect that increased sales of these products will have a negative effect on our overall gross margin 
we also expect that packaging will continue to comprise a significant and growing component of our sales 
the cost of sales of our quattro products is lower than our corporate average  and we expect that increased sales of these products will have a positive effect on our overall gross margin 
in the solar market  we have achieved new design wins with solar cell manufacturers that we believe will provide significant opportunity for adept as these manufacturers begin to equip their automation environments and ramp up their production operations 
however  we believe sales to the solar market will continue to be constricted until the global economic environment strengthens  end user demand increases and the lending environment for capital purchases improves 
because of our acquisition of mri in the fourth quarter of  we also expect to increase our focus on the health care industry during fiscal summary of the fiscal fourth quarter revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  up from million for the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of both higher product sales and services revenues 
an active disk drive investment cycle in asia and continued strong and stable demand from the packaging market in france and germany fueled growth of in our robotics business 
this was partially offset by continued weakness in the german automotive industrial market and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on our business 
gross profit margin was of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with of revenue in the fourth quarter of gross profit margin in the fiscal fourth quarter was favorably impacted by higher revenues than in the previous year period  as well as higher sales of our quattro products  which have a relatively high margin 
this was partially offset by the increase in sales of lower margin products for the disk drive market  as well as a weakening of the euro and a strengthening of the yen compared to the us dollar 
table of contents during the quarter  as approximately half of our sales are invoiced in euros but reported in us dollars and a portion of our components are sourced in japan 
additionally  our gross profit margin in the fiscal fourth quarter was negatively impacted by inventory write downs totaling  that were related to our restructuring activities 
operating expenses increased by to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase was across all expense areas  but was greatest in those areas that are related to our product development  our sales capabilities and our acquisition of mri  for which we recorded approximately  of transaction costs in the quarter 
operating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared to operating loss of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter was million  or net loss per share  compared to net loss of million  or net loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal acquisition of mobilerobots inc on june   the company acquired mri 
the results of mri s operations have been included in adept s consolidated financial statements since that date 
mri  based in new hampshire  is a provider of autonomous robot and automated guided vehicle technologies 
the merger consideration payable to mri stockholders included cash of million  net of cash acquired and subject to adjustment for debt and working capital  and  shares of adept common stock  of which is restricted stock subject to certain vesting and restrictions as security for the stockholders indemnification obligations 
the restricted stock will be released in equal thirds on each of the first  second and third anniversaries of the closing date of the acquisition  contingent upon the continued employment of each selling stockholder and subject to the indemnification obligations of the stockholders 
adept has also agreed to pay bonus amounts in cash up to an aggregate  to employees of mri after fiscal if certain mri product revenue targets are met for fiscal the selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify adept for breaches of representations  warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement up to million 
the term of the indemnification will expire eighteen months from the date of closing  with exceptions for core corporate and intellectual property representations  taxes and fraud 
at closing   shares were placed in an escrow fund for months as security for the indemnification obligations 
we believe our acquisition of mri will give adept the ability to offer applications such as automated warehousing and logistics and to address new markets  including production logistics and healthcare 
mri brings a high level of expertise in autonomous platform design and advanced fleet management that allow robots to navigate flexibly in unstructured environments 
this capability is critical for operating individual robots in hospitals or fleets of agvs in factories as they move components through production environments 
restructuring and cost reduction actions in response to economic uncertainty and the more cautious outlook of our customers  during fiscal we implemented a comprehensive restructuring program as part of an overall initiative to focus on generating cash flow while maintaining investment in our target markets 
beginning in the second quarter of  we began implementing restructuring actions that by the end of the fiscal year resulted in savings of million per quarter 
our restructuring actions included a reduction in headcount  temporary salary reductions for all employees and more significant salary reductions for our executive management team  the phase out of certain unprofitable business lines and the consolidation of facilities and operating functions  and the write off of goodwill and amortization expenses associated with our acquisition of cerebellum 

table of contents as the economic situation began to improve  in the beginning of the second quarter of we partially restored salaries for our non executive employees and fully restored all salaries at the end of the second quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal  overall expense levels remained below both pre restructuring and fiscal levels 
additionally  in the second half of fiscal we began to selectively increase our investment in product development and our sales capabilities to ensure we are well positioned to address the expected growth of our target markets 
for fiscal  we believe that the additional expenses related to our acquisition of mri will result in an average quarterly expense rate in line with our fiscal fourth quarter operating expenses 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flow during the two year period ended june   each year therein referred to as fiscal and  reflecting requirements applicable to adept as a smaller reporting company 
unless otherwise indicated  references to any year in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to our fiscal year ended june this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report on form k 
results of operations revenues the following table sets forth our annual revenues and year to year change in revenues by business segment for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenue by segment robotics revenues percentage of total revenues services and support revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal the increase in total revenues resulted from a sales increase in our robotics segment  slightly offset by a decrease in our services and support segment 
robotics segment revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal higher robotics revenues in fiscal were the result of higher demand from the disk drive electronics  packaging and solar markets  offset by decreased sales to the automotive and industrial markets 
services and support segment revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower demand for refurbished robotics from disk drive and consumer electronics manufacturers in the us and asia  as well as lower demand from the automotive electronics and industrial markets in germany 

table of contents the following table sets forth our annual revenues and year to year change in revenues by geographic region for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenue by geography united states revenues percentage of total revenues europe revenues percentage of total revenues asia revenues percentage of total revenues other countries revenues percentage of total revenues total international revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues our domestic revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal this decrease reflects lower demand for automation solutions as a result of the economic downturn  as well as a shift in the location of purchases related to the disk drive industry during the year  from the us to asia 
these factors were partially offset by increased sales of our quattro robots and other solutions for applications in the packaging market 
our international revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal this increase resulted from a rise in asia sales  partially offset by lower sales in europe and other countries 
revenues in asia primarily consisted of sales to the disk drive and consumer electronics markets  as well as a small amount of revenue from sales to the packaging and solar markets 
european sales in fiscal fell to million  compared with million in fiscal this decrease was primarily a result of decreased demand from the automotive electronics market in germany and from the industrial markets in germany and the uk and decreased sales in france  partially offset by increased sales to the packaging market in germany 
gross margin the following table sets forth our gross margin and year to year change in gross margin for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenues gross margin gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal 
table of contents gross margin in fiscal was favorably affected by higher revenues overall and by increased sales of our quattro robots  which have a margin that is higher than our corporate average 
these factors were partially offset by significantly higher sales of lower margin products for the disk drive market  as well as the negative impact of currency exchange 
during the second half of the fiscal year  the weakening of the euro against the us dollar decreased our gross margin  as approximately half of our sales are invoiced in euros but reported in us dollars 
during the fiscal fourth quarter  the strengthening of the japanese yen against the us dollar also increased the costs of our components sourced from japan 
gross margin in fiscal was favorable affected by strong sales of our higher margin quattro robots  offset by low sales volumes in europe and low sales in our higher margin services business  as well as an unfavorable currency impact associated with low european sales and the weakening of the euro against the us dollar 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we wrote down inventory related to lower demand for our refurbished robots that accounted for a decrease to our gross margin of approximately percentage points 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our gross margin percentage from period to period due to changes in volume  changes in availability of components  changes in product configuration  increased price based competition  changes in sales mix of products and or changes in operating costs 
in particular  we expect that anticipated sales into the disk drive market will continue to have a negative impact on gross margin  while anticipated quattro sales will have a positive effect 
in addition  we expect that changes in currency valuations will continue to impact gross margin  as a significant portion of our revenues are in euro and a portion of our components are paid for in japanese yen 
operating expenses research  development and engineering the following table sets forth our research  development and engineering expenses and year to year change in these expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands expenses percentage of revenue research  development and engineering r d costs are expensed as incurred  with the exception of software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and up to the general release of the software products that are capitalized 
technological feasibility is demonstrated by the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over either two or three years  whichever term is the estimated life of the software product 
r d expenses in fiscal were million  or of revenues  from million  or of revenues  in fiscal during the first and second quarters of fiscal  r d headcount and salary levels were lower than normal as a result of cost reduction measures implemented during fiscal in response to the economic downturn 
employee salaries were fully restored at the end of the second quarter of fiscal we expect that quarterly r d expenses in fiscal will increase incrementally from fiscal fourth quarter levels of million for that quarter  based on an increased level of product investment and the addition of personnel from our acquisition of mri 
adept s capitalization of software costs was zero in fiscal and  in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table sets forth our selling  general and administrative expenses and year to year change in these expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands expenses percentage of revenue selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  professional fees arising from legal  auditing and other consulting services  as well as tradeshow participation and other marketing costs 
sg a expenses were million  or of revenues in fiscal  down from million  or of revenues in fiscal during the first and second quarters of fiscal  sg a headcount and salary levels were lower than normal as a result of cost reduction measures implemented during fiscal in response to the economic downturn 
employee salaries were fully restored at the end of the second quarter of fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal included approximately  in transaction costs related to our acquisition of mri 
sg a expenses in fiscal included  in reserves for doubtful accounts taken in the second quarter of based on the deterioration in the economic environment  million related to our lease dispute settlement and associated legal fees and expenses related to the relocation of our corporate offices offset by a credit of  on accrued rent reversal 
we expect that quarterly fixed sg a expenses will increase modestly during fiscal from the million recorded in the fourth quarter of  reflecting both our increased investment in sales resources and programs that support our strategy for growth  as well as the addition of general and administrative personnel associated with our acquisition of mri 
amortization 
no amortization expenses were incurred during fiscal as the intangible assets related to our cerebellum acquisition were fully written off in fiscal year amortization of intangible assets in fiscal was  amortization expense will increase significantly for the intangible assets acquired in our mri acquisition 
goodwill and intangibles 
on june   adept acquired mri 
goodwill of  and intangible assets of million were acquired as a result of the acquisition of mri 
of the million in intangible assets   was assigned to patents to be amortized over five to ten years and  was assigned to the customer base to be amortized over three years 
adept evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet at least annually and we record a charge for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based on our end of year evaluation and conclusion of the valuation of the approflex software system acquired from cerebellum  for fiscal  we recorded an impairment to intangible assets of  stock compensation expense 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal for our stock option plans  espp and restricted stock grants 
restricted stock awarded at the end of the first quarter of fiscal was more heavily expensed in the earlier quarters of the stock s grant 
table of contents life and was almost fully vested in the second quarter of fiscal  resulting in a decrease in the amount expensed for stock compensation in the fiscal periods 
we did not record an income tax benefit for stock compensation expense in either fiscal or because of the extent of our net operating loss carryforwards 
in fiscal  we expect stock compensation expense to increase from fiscal levels due to the expensing of restricted stock that was issued in connection with our acquisition of mri in june and restricted stock and stock option grants made to our executives and key employees in august see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our recognition of stock based compensation expense 
restructuring charges 
no restructuring expenses were recorded in fiscal we recorded million in net restructuring charges in related to restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter of that continued during the remainder of the fiscal year  as further described under restructuring and cost reduction actions in the overview above 
operating loss 
we recorded an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal lower operating loss in fiscal resulted from higher revenues and gross margin and lower expenses compared with the prior year  as well as the absence of restructuring expenses or impairment charges in fiscal interest income expense  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  was  in fiscal  compared with interest income  net of interest expense  of  in fiscal foreign currency translation and transaction gain loss 
adept s foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains were  in fiscal and foreign currency transaction losses were  in fiscal during  most of adept s intercompany balances were deemed permanent capital investments in its subsidiaries and are no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
in fiscal year  the us dollar denominated accounts in europe experienced gains due to the strengthening value of the us dollar 
these gains were offset by the losses resulting from yen denominated accounts in the us due to the strengthening value of the japanese yen 
the foreign currency transaction losses recorded in the period ended june  were primarily unrealized losses from the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro related to cash  intercompany debt and accounts receivable balances in the company s european subsidiaries 
the loss was also affected by the strengthening of the japanese yen versus the us dollar for inventory purchases sourced in japan 
as we conduct business on a global basis we are continually exposed to adverse or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates  which can vary considerably from period to period 
the dollar euro and the dollar yen markets currently present the largest exchange rate risk for adept 
we do not currently employ a currency hedging strategy 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
adept typically provides for income taxes during interim reporting periods based upon an estimate of our annual effective tax rate 
we also maintain a liability to cover the cost of additional tax exposure items on the filing of federal and state income tax returns as well as filings in foreign jurisdictions 
each of these filing jurisdictions may audit the tax returns filed and propose adjustments 
adjustments arise from a variety of factors  including different interpretations of statutes and regulations 
we recorded a benefit from income taxes of  for fiscal  as compared with a provision for income taxes of  for fiscal in both periods  the tax provision represents federal and state alternative 
table of contents minimum tax requirements as well as foreign tax expense primarily related to our german and french operations 
we have net operating losses that are sufficient to offset a significant portion of our domestic and foreign tax obligations  except when annual net operating loss limitations exist for domestic and foreign jurisdictions that result in some tax expense 
backlog 
our product backlog at june  was approximately million as compared to approximately million at june  the increase in backlog at the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal is due to increased capital investment by our customers 
customers who have placed orders with delivery dates beyond twelve months from the end of the fiscal quarter are not included in backlog  and thus we expect substantially all backlog at june  to ship during fiscal because orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances may be subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer  our backlog at any date may not be indicative of demand for our products or actual revenues for any period in the future 
liquidity and capital resources changes in the company s liquidity during the year ended june  are primarily the net effect of cash generated by operations  cash provided from the company s line of credit  capital expenditures and the acquisition of mri 
cash and cash equivalents were million at june  in fiscal year  net cash generated by operations of million primarily resulted from an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  due primarily to increased inventory purchases and expenses related to our acquisition of mri  partially offset by an increase of million in net accounts receivable from increased sales compared to fiscal year other uses of cash from operations included the net loss for the year ended june  of million and the increase in inventory of million  which were partially offset by non cash items of million of depreciation and million of stock based compensation 
in fiscal year  the company used million of cash in investing activities  including million for the acquisition of mri and  for purchases of property and equipment 
in fiscal year  cash provided from financing activities primarily consisted of the million draw on the company s line of credit offset by payment of debt and stock option activity 
in fiscal  the adept board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to million of adept stock over an unspecified time period 
during fiscal   shares were repurchased for  the program was discontinued on august  silicon valley bank line of credit we have a revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank  or svb 
we originally entered into the loan and security agreement and related agreements for the revolving line in may in june  adept and svb amended the loan and security agreement and certain of the related agreements  and entered into additional related agreements in connection with the acquisition of mri 
when we refer to the loan and security agreement  we refer to the agreement as amended 
under the revolving line  adept may borrow  in us dollars  amounts not to exceed the lesser of million  or the sum of of our eligible accounts receivable  plus of our eligible inventory  plus the amount  if any  by which adept s and certain of our subsidiaries unrestricted cash held in svb accounts exceeds million 
the loan and security agreement specifies the criteria for determining eligible accounts receivable and inventory  and limits the eligibility of foreign accounts receivable and inventory 
adept may enter into foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts with svb up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of million 
we also may use the revolving line for certain cash management services  and request that svb issue letters of credit to others for the company s account 
letters of credit payable in a 
table of contents foreign currency are subject to a reserve equal to of the us dollar equivalent of the face amount of such letters of credit 
the aggregate amount available under the revolving line at any time is equal to the borrowing base minus the face amount of outstanding letters of credit and letter of credit reserve  an amount equal to of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts  any amounts used for cash management services and the principal balance of all outstanding advances 
adept may choose to have borrowings bear interest either at the prime rate announced from time to time by svb plus  or at libor plus 
the procedures for determining libor  and the procedures for and potential impacts of borrowing at libor  are specified in further detail in the loan and security agreement 
adept s ability to make borrowings under the revolving line is subject to ongoing conditions precedent that our representations and warranties in the loan and security agreement are true  in all material respects  on the date on which we request the borrowing and on the funding date  and that svb determines  in its sole discretion  that there has been no material impairment in our business  results of operation  financial condition  or the prospect of repayment of our obligations to svb  or any material adverse deviation from our most recent business plan submitted to svb 
pursuant to the loan and security agreement and related agreements  adept granted svb a security interest in substantially all of the company s assets  and pledged certain of our shares of certain wholly owned subsidiaries to svb 
certain adept subsidiaries also guaranteed adept s obligations under the loan and security agreement  granted svb a security interest in substantially all of their respective assets  and pledged shares of certain indirect  wholly owned adept subsidiaries 
the revolving line will mature on june   unless adept terminates it earlier upon written notice to svb 
adept must meet certain financial covenants during the term of the loan and security agreement 
we are required to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of to the adjusted quick ratio is the ratio of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus accounts receivable net of reserves  to current liabilities 
we also are required to maintain liquidity domestic cash plus up to million of the available borrowing base under the revolving line of at least million 
in addition  our quarterly adjusted ebitda  as defined in the loan and security agreement  must equal or exceed specified amounts which are minimum amounts for financial covenant purposes only  and do not represent projections of adept s financial results 
we also must remain in compliance with various other covenants 
for example  we must maintain our primary operating deposit accounts with svb  and cause our us customers to transmit payments to a lockbox account at svb 
svb will transfer amounts collected from customers in the lockbox account to the company s designated deposit account at svb  unless our adjusted quick ratio is below to  or there is any default under the loan and security agreement  in which case svb will first apply collections from the lockbox account toward repayment of our obligations to svb  and then transfer any excess to svb s designated deposit account 
adept may not permit or suffer any specified change in control  including any change in the beneficial ownership of or more or or more  in the case of shares held by one specified stockholder group of adept s outstanding shares  without svb s consent 
various other covenants restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  our ability to pay dividends  incur additional indebtedness or encumber our assets  the types of transactions including mergers and acquisitions we may enter into and our ability to transfer funds to subsidiaries 
adept would be deemed to be in default under the loan and security agreement if we failed to timely pay any amount owed to svb  if we failed to comply with specified financial and other covenants  including those listed above  if we otherwise materially breached  without cure  any of our representations under or other provisions in the loan documents  if there occurs a material adverse change in our or any guarantor subsidiary s business  operations or condition  or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of our obligations to svb  or a material impairment in the perfection or priority of svb s security interests or the value of svb s security interest in our or any guarantor subsidiary s assets  or if svb determines there is a reasonable likelihood that we will not meet our financial covenants in the next succeeding quarter  if any involuntary lien or attachment is 
table of contents issued against adept s or any guarantor subsidiary s assets  or any judgment or order in excess of  is entered against adept or any guarantor subsidiary  that is not discharged  vacated or satisfied within ten days  if adept or any guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent or is generally not paying its debts as they become due  if adept or any guarantor subsidiary makes any material written misrepresentation to svb  if we fail to pay amounts due under or otherwise materially breaches any agreements with third parties  or if a default occurs under such agreements which permits indebtedness in excess of  to be accelerated  if breaches occur under agreements related to subordinated debt that may be outstanding during the term of the loan  if there is any revocation or termination of  or nonperformance of any obligation or covenant under  any guaranty of adept s obligations  or if we lose government approvals or become subject to certain governmental actions that could materially adversely affect us 
upon a default  svb may  among other things  cease making loans to adept  accelerate and declare all or any part of our obligations to be immediately due and payable  and enforce its security interest against the collateral 
adept was in compliance with the covenants of the loan and security agreement as of june  adept is required to pay a facility fee of  in may or upon early termination of the loan and security agreement prior to such anniversary date 
we must pay a fee  quarterly in arrears  equal to 
per annum of the average unused portion of the credit line 
during periods when there are outstanding balances of principal and interest under the revolving line  svb is entitled to charge a float charge  payable monthly  in an amount equal to one extra day of interest on each payment received by svb from adept during the month 
we must pay a collateral monitoring fee of per month if our adjusted quick ratio as defined above is less than to during the month  and there were outstanding balances of principal and interest or outstanding issued letters of credit during the month 
we also must pay a letter of credit fee of per annum of the us dollar equivalent face amount of issued letters of credit  and all other bank fees and expenses related to the loan transaction 
adept has an outstanding principal balance of million under the revolving line  which was borrowed in connection with the acquisition of mri and bears interest at svb s announced prime rate plus 
based on operating needs  strategic planning and other factors  we may further utilize the line of credit in the future 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  including capitalized software development costs  of million and million net of depreciation at june  and  respectively  and million of goodwill and other intangible assets net of amortization at june  acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal as part of the mri acquisition 
in fiscal  we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles related to the cerebellum acquisition was not supportable because the estimate of future cash flows related to these intangible assets was not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such intangibles 
accordingly  we wrote down the entire value of goodwill and intangible assets related to this acquisition and recorded an impairment of  for these intangibles 
legal proceedings from time to time  we are subject to various other lawsuits and claims relating to issues such as contract disputes  product liability  and employee and other matters 
although the results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters  to the extent not previously provided for  will not have a material adverse effect  individually or in the aggregate  on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole 
we have in the past received communications from third parties asserting that we have infringed certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others  or seeking indemnification against alleged infringement 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the likelihood or outcome of any actual or potential actions from such assertions against us  we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of adept s financial condition and results of operations are based upon adept s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty obligations  bad debt  inventories  cancellation costs associated with long term commitments  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  service contracts  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and it is possible that such changes could occur in the near term 
reclassifications 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to present the financial statements on a consistent basis with current year presentation 
such reclassifications have not changed previously reported net income loss or stockholders equity 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our consolidated financial statements while considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these critical accounting policies described below include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  warranties  capitalization of software development costs  accounting for income taxes  foreign currency accounting  long lived assets and goodwill  valuation of stock based awards  and commitments and contingencies 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of production automation equipment and parts  and to a lesser extent from support and service activities associated with this equipment 
non software product revenue consists primarily of sales of robots  refurbished robots and spare parts 
we recognize non software product revenue when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer  and when an economic exchange has taken place 
we use the signed purchase contract or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
product revenues are normally recognized at the point of shipment from adept facilities since title and risk of loss passes to the customers at that time 
customers generally have no right of return other than for product defects covered by our warranty 
adept maintains a warranty liability based on our historical warranty experience and managements best estimate of our warranty 
table of contents liability at each balance sheet date 
there are no acceptance criteria on our standard non software products 
we do not deem the fee to be fixed or determinable where a significant portion of the price is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from the invoice date 
in recording revenue  management exercises judgment about the collectibility of receivables based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we conclude that collection is not reasonably assured  then the revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed  generally upon receipt of payment 
our experience is that we have been able to reliably determine whether collection is reasonably assured 
adept s robots and controllers have features that are enabled or enhanced through the use of software enabling tools and other software elements  which are embedded within our robot and controller products 
our software enabling tools or other software elements do not operate independently of the robots or controllers  and they are not sold separately and cannot be used without the robots or controllers 
we also sell optional software used to enhance capability of our products 
we believe that the software component of our products is incidental to our products and services taken as a whole 
service and support revenue consists primarily of sales of spare parts and refurbished robots 
service revenue also includes training  consulting and customer support  the latter of which includes all field service activities  ie  maintenance  repairs  system modifications or upgrades 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
these revenues are not essential to the product functionality and  therefore  do not bear on the revenue recognition policy for adept s component products 
deferred revenues represent payments received from customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements enumerated above  as well as cases in which we have invoiced the customer but cannot yet recognize the revenue for the same reasons discussed above 
revenue for robot refurbishment relates to adept owned or customer owned refurbished robots and components 
we receive parts returned from customers under warranty contracts  or we purchase surplus used parts available from customers or suppliers 
these parts traditionally have lower cost  and internal analysis indicates that on average  we pay a percentage of the new part cost to acquire these components 
the standard cost for acquired parts is therefore set at such percentage of cost in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requiring valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market 
by contrast  the cost basis starting point for customer owned refurbished or repaired robots is zero since adept does not own the robots 
for all refurbishment and remanufacturing  we track all related costs and activities materials and labor required to bring the robots up to standard using work orders 
this revenue stream is included within our services and support segment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not request collateral from our customers 
however  we may require customers to make payments in advance of shipment or provide a letter of credit under certain circumstances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our policy is to record specific allowances against known doubtful accounts 
an additional allowance is also calculated based on the greater of of consolidated accounts receivable or of consolidated accounts receivable more than days past due 
specific allowances are netted out of the respective receivable balances for purposes of calculating this additional allowance 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and  should the default rate change or the financial positions of our customers change  we may increase this additional allowance percentage 

table of contents inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or market value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes  among other factors  a review of component demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans  and quality issues 
as a result of this assessment  we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated liquidation value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
manufacturing inventory includes raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
the inventory valuation provisions are based on an excess and obsolete systems report  which captures all obsolete parts and products and all other inventory  which have quantities on hand in excess of one year s projected demand 
individual line item exceptions are identified for either inclusion or exclusion from the inventory valuation provision 
the materials control group and cost accounting function monitor the line item exceptions and make periodic adjustments as necessary 
warranties 
our warranty policy is included in our terms of sale  generally as a two year parts and one year labor limited warranty on most hardware and component products  and states that there are no rights of return  and that a refund may be made at adept s discretion  and only if there is an identified fault in the product and the customer has complied with adept s approved maintenance schedules and procedures  and the product has not been subject to abuse 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and costs per claim for repair or replacement 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our components suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service labor and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  service labor or delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
capitalization of software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs 
we begin capitalizing software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility  which is established upon the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
costs incurred prior to technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization ceases when the product is considered available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs are amortized to costs of revenues over the estimated economic lives of the software products based on product life expectancy 
generally  estimated economic lives of the software products do not exceed three years 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 
our net deferred tax assets relate predominantly to our united states tax jurisdiction 
we currently maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined using an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
our us loss  among other considerations  provides negative evidence and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 

table of contents we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including related interest  is adequate 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
foreign currency accounting 
each of our non us subsidiaries uses its respective local currency as the functional currency 
our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from transactions  including intercompany balances not considered to be a permanent investment  denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we do not currently apply a hedging strategy against our currency positions 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
acquisition related intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their economic lives 
goodwill is measured and tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends  restructuring actions  lower projections of profitability  or a sustained decline in our market capitalization 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its net book value  including goodwill 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  an impairment exists and is recorded 
valuation of stock based awards 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of the individual equity instrument 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes calculation for option grants is based on historical volatility as options on our stock are not traded 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
commitments and contingencies 
we evaluate potential commitments and contingencies based on their anticipated outcome 
if we determine  after consideration of all known facts and consultation with legal counsel  that a loss related to the potential matter is neither probable or cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of issuance of our fiscal period end reports  we do not accrue for the potential liability 
if a loss is reasonably possible related to the matter  we will disclose the relevant facts of the matter along with an estimated loss amount or range if such amount or range can be reasonably estimated
