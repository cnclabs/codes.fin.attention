item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements are not historical facts  but rather are based on current expectations  estimates  assumptions and projections about our industry  business and future financial results 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed under risk factors in part i  item a above 
business overview we design  develop and market innovative networking products that address the specific needs of small business and home users 
we define small business as a business with fewer than employees 
we are focused on satisfying the ease of use  reliability  performance and affordability requirements of these users 
our product offerings enable users to share internet access  peripherals  files  digital multimedia content and applications among multiple networked devices and other internet enabled devices 
our product line consists of wired and wireless devices that enable small business networking  broadband access  network connectivity  network storage and security appliances 
these products are available in multiple configurations to address the needs of our end users in each geographic region in which our products are sold 
we sell our networking products through multiple sales channels worldwide  including traditional retailers  online retailers  wholesale distributors  dmrs  vars  and broadband service providers 
our retail channel includes traditional retail locations domestically and internationally  such as best buy  walmart  fry s electronics  radio shack  staples  argos uk  dixons uk  pc world uk  mediamarkt germany  austria and darty france 
online retailers include amazon 
com  dell  newegg 
com and buy 
com 
our dmrs include cdw corporation  insight corporation and pc connection in domestic markets and misco throughout europe 
in addition  we also sell our products through broadband service providers  such as multiple system operators msos  dsl  and other broadband technology operators domestically and internationally 
some of these retailers and broadband service providers purchase directly from us while others are fulfilled through wholesale distributors around the world 
a substantial portion of our net revenue to date has been derived from a limited number of customers  the largest of which are best buy  ingram micro inc and tech data corporation 
we expect that these customers will continue to contribute a significant percentage of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
we have well developed channels in the united states and europe  middle east and africa  or emea  and are building a strong presence in the asia pacific and latin american regions 
we derive the majority of our net revenue from international sales 
international sales as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in international sales decreased from million in to million in  
table of contents representing a decrease of approximately during that period  primarily due to the relatively stronger us dollar and weakened international economic conditions 
we continue to penetrate new markets such as brazil  russia and eastern europe  india  and the middle east 
our net revenue declined during the year ended december  primarily attributable to lower shipments of our broadband gateway products to traditional resellers and existing service provider customers 
however  we did experience an increase of in net revenue in the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  additionally  we experienced weakening demand for our switch products and wireless g products 
our revenue decline continued to be negatively impacted by the economic downturn and relatively stronger us dollar 
these decreases were partially mitigated by increased sales of wireless n products sold to retailers and existing service provider customers as well as our increased focus on reducing sales incentives that impact revenue 
the small business and home networking markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect our competition to continue to intensify 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the small business and home markets for networking products include product breadth  size and scope of the sales channel  brand name  timeliness of new product introductions  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  ease of installation  maintenance and use  and customer service and support 
to remain competitive  we believe we must invest resources in developing new products and enhancing our current products while continuing to expand our channels and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 
our gross margin decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily attributable to the impact of a relatively stronger us dollar on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
gross margins were also impacted by sales declines of our switch products as well as supply constraints late in the year which resulted in the use of higher cost air freight expense to acquire inventory levels sufficient to support increased demand 
these margin decreases were partially offset by our increased focus on reducing sales incentives that impact net revenue 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in salary and other employee related expenses as well as a million decrease in marketing expenses and other outside service costs pertaining to sales and marketing 
net income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross profit of million 
this decrease was offset by a decrease in operating expenses of million and a decrease in other expense  net of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we have listed below our critical accounting policies which we believe to have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
currently  for some of our customers  title passes to the customer upon delivery to the port or country of destination  upon their receipt of the product  or upon the customer s resale of the product 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  we estimate and defer revenue related to product where title has not transferred 
the revenue continues to be deferred until such time that title passes to the customer 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including general economic and market conditions  past transaction history with the customer  and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of the corresponding receivable is not reasonably assured  then we defer the revenue until receipt of payment 
allowances for product warranties  returns due to stock rotation  sales incentives and doubtful accounts our standard warranty obligation to our direct customers generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable or is found to be damaged or defective 
at the time revenue is recognized  an estimate of future warranty returns is recorded to reduce revenue in the amount of the expected credit or refund to be provided to our direct customers 
at the time we record the reduction to revenue related to warranty returns  we include within cost of revenue a write down to reduce the carrying value of such products to net realizable value 
our standard warranty obligation to end users provides for replacement of a defective product for one or more years 
factors that affect the warranty obligation include product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
the estimated cost associated with fulfilling the warranty obligation to end users is recorded in cost of revenue 
because our products are manufactured by third party manufacturers  in certain cases we have recourse to the third party manufacturer for replacement or credit for the defective products 
we give consideration to amounts recoverable from our third party manufacturers in determining our warranty liability 
our estimated allowances for product warranties can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional revenue reductions or charges to cost of revenue which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to warranty related returns  certain distributors and retailers generally have the right to return product for stock rotation purposes 
every quarter  stock rotation rights are generally limited to of invoiced sales to the distributor or retailer in the prior quarter 
upon shipment of the product  we reduce revenue for an estimate of potential future stock rotation returns related to the current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  channel inventory levels  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for our products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  namely stock rotation returns 
our estimated allowances for returns due to stock rotation can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional revenue reductions which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we accrue for sales incentives as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction of revenues 
our estimated provisions for sales incentives can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional expenses or additional revenue reductions dependent on the classification of the sales incentive 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and consider factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and geographic or country specific risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and adjusted if necessary based on our assessments of our customers ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers should deteriorate or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  additional allowances may be required  which could have an adverse impact on operating expenses 

table of contents valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we continually assess the value of our inventory and will periodically write down its value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and on order under non cancelable purchase commitments  including consignment inventory  in comparison to our estimated forecast of product demand for the next nine months to determine what inventory  if any  are not saleable 
our analysis is based on the demand forecast but takes into account market conditions  product development plans  product life expectancy and other factors 
based on this analysis  we write down the affected inventory value for estimated excess and obsolescence charges 
at the point of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
as demonstrated during prior years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand and we fail to reduce our manufacturing accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative effect on our gross profit 
goodwill and intangibles we apply the authoritative guidance for intangibles and perform an annual goodwill impairment test 
should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests  we will perform the impairment test as those events or indicators occur 
for purposes of impairment testing  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
in the first step  we estimate our fair value and compare the fair value with the carrying value of our net assets 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying value of our net assets  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than our carrying value  then we would perform the second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if we were being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of our assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we would evaluate goodwill for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in the business climate  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group  and slower growth rates 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the annual impairment test of goodwill 
in conducting our impairment test  we determined that our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets by approximately 
no goodwill impairment loss was recognized in the years ended december    or given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing during the year ended december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or earnings are not achieved  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes a triggering event outside of the quarter from when the annual goodwill impairment test is performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 

table of contents purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from two to five years 
purchased intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the carrying value of the asset is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts  both internal and external  that may suggest impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  a key employee responsible for managing the asset group acquired in connection with our acquisition of skipjam corp 
departed the company 
the departure of this employee  along with the recent economic environment  resulted in our decision to reduce efforts geared at marketing the related products 
as a result  we performed an impairment analysis of these long lived assets during the fourth quarter of based on the results of the analysis  we recorded an impairment charge within cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations of  in the year ended december  for the net carrying value of intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisition of skipjam corp 
during the years ended december  and  there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows 
consequently  we did not perform an impairment test or record an impairment of our long lived assets during those periods 
we will continue to evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets and if we determine in the future that there is a potential further impairment  we may be required to record additional charges to earnings which could affect our financial results 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from different treatments for tax versus accounting of certain items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets are recoverable  however  if there were a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would be required to take a charge in the period in which we determined that recovery was not more likely than not 
we adopted updated authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertain income tax positions on january  that clarified the accounting for uncertain income tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
it provides that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the income tax position taken 
income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
we include interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional tax expense

net revenue compared to net revenue net revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue was principally attributable to lower shipments of our broadband gateway products to traditional resellers and existing service provider customers 
additionally  we experienced weakening demand for our switch products and wireless g products 
our revenue decline continued to be negatively impacted by the economic downturn and relatively stronger us dollar 
these decreases were partially mitigated by increased sales of wireless n products sold to retailers and existing service provider customers as well as our increased focus on reducing sales incentives that impact net revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue generated in the united states  emea and asia pacific and rest of world was  and  respectively 
the comparable net revenue for the year ended december  was  and  respectively 
the change in net revenue over the prior year for each region amounted to a increase  a decrease  and a decrease  respectively 

table of contents net revenue compared to net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we experienced lower net revenue in the second half of the year due to the economic downturn and the rapid strengthening of the us dollar 
the increase in total year revenue was attributable to higher sales in several of our product categories 
these include wireless g products sold to existing service provider customers and the full year sales of our readynas products  which were acquired in connection with our acquisition of infrant in may  as well as growth in wireless n router sales 
the growth was partially offset by a decrease in dsl gateway products sold 
sales incentives that are classified as contra revenue grew at a slower rate than overall gross sales  which further contributed to the increased net revenue

cost of revenue and gross margin year ended december  percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentage data cost of revenue gross margin percentage cost of revenue consists primarily of the following the cost of finished products from our third party manufacturers  overhead costs including purchasing  product planning  inventory control  warehousing and distribution logistics  inbound freight  warranty costs associated with returned goods  write downs for excess and obsolete inventory  and amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles 
we outsource our manufacturing  warehousing and distribution logistics 
we believe this outsourcing strategy allows us to better manage our product costs and gross margin 
our gross margin can be affected by a number of factors  including fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  sales returns  changes in net revenues due to changes in average selling prices  end user customer rebates and other sales incentives  and changes in our cost of goods sold due to fluctuations in prices paid for components  net of vendor rebates  warranty and overhead costs  inbound freight  conversion costs  and charges for excess or obsolete inventory

cost of revenue and gross margin compared to cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our gross margin decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  
table of contents the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to sales of products carrying lower gross margins to service providers and the impact on our foreign currency denominated revenues due to the strengthening of the us dollar  as well as higher warranty costs associated with end user warranty returns 
additionally  inventory reserves increased primarily due to selling price declines of certain products 
these declines were primarily attributable to the strengthening of the us dollar in locations where we bill in local currencies 
these negative margin impacts were partially mitigated by reduced air freight expenses as a result of increased on hand inventory levels which allowed us to minimize the amount of higher cost air freight expense  as well as reduced marketing expenses 
additionally  stock based compensation expense increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  operating expenses research and development expense year ended december  percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentage data research and development expense percentage of net revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  payments to suppliers for design services  safety and regulatory testing  product certification expenditures to qualify our products for sale into specific markets  prototypes and other consulting fees 
research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred 
we have invested in building our research and development organization to enhance our ability to introduce innovative and easy to use products 
in the future  we believe that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand into new networking product technologies and broaden our core competencies 
research and development expense compared to research and development expense research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased costs of million related to a reduction in payroll and other employee expenses  including decreased variable compensation and a reduction in travel expenses which was partly in response to our cost cutting initiatives 
included in the million was a decrease of approximately  due to acquisition related contingent compensation 
additionally  stock based compensation expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in costs allocated to research and development from other functional expense categories of  primarily resulting from increased facilities costs and higher information technology costs related to our new enterprise resource planning software

employee headcount increased from employees as of december  to employees as of december  most of our increase in headcount occurred in connection with our expansion in emea and asia pacific 
furthermore  outbound freight increased million  reflecting our higher unit volume sales  and costs allocated to sales and marketing from other functional expense categories increased million due to increased facilities costs primarily related to our new corporate headquarters in san jose  california

additionally  in compared to  tax attributable to foreign operations increased the effective tax rate by percentage points 
this was primarily caused by the tax effect of non deductible losses in foreign jurisdictions where no benefit can be claimed as well as increases in earnings in countries with rates higher than

on october   the board of directors approved plans to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
during the year ended december   we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under this repurchase authorization 
during the year ended december  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market for cash of million 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million shares under the share repurchase plan 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for our common stock repurchases 
the stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on various factors including  but not limited to  such factors as levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for acquisitions  and current stock price 
although we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under this repurchase authorization  we repurchased approximately  shares  or  of common stock  related to the lapse of restricted stock units during the year ended december  based on our current plans and market conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that our planned levels of revenue  costs and expenses will be achieved 
if our operating results fail to meet our expectations or if we fail to manage our inventory  accounts receivable or other assets  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in addition  as we continue to expand our product offerings  channels and geographic presence  we may require additional working capital 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable or commercially acceptable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
backlog as of december   we had a backlog of approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of december   primarily due to supply constraints and greater product demand in the three months ended december  our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and which are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment 
while we expect to fulfill the order backlog within the current year  most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with little or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in product scheduling or order cancellation  our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of net sales for any succeeding period

goodwill will be recorded based on the residual purchase price after allocating the purchase price to the fair market value of intangible assets acquired certain expensed acquisition costs

we have also accrued for the expected loss on certain facilities we do not intend to sublease 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in highly rated short term securities 
our investment policy requires investments to be rated triple a with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
we monitor our interest rate and credit risks  including our credit exposure to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
there were no impairment charges on our investments during fiscal foreign currency transaction risk we invoice some of our international customers in foreign currencies including  but not limited to  the australian dollar  british pound  euro  and japanese yen 
as the customers that are currently invoiced in local currency become a larger percentage of our business  or to the extent we begin to bill additional customers in foreign currencies  the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a more significant impact on our results of operations 
for those customers in our international markets that we continue to sell to in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand for our products could reduce sales and negatively impact our operating results 
certain operating expenses of our foreign operations require payment in the local currencies 
we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international sales and operating activities 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
we began using foreign currency forward contract derivatives in the fourth quarter of to partially offset our business exposure to foreign exchange risk on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
additionally  in the second quarter of we began 
table of contents entering into certain foreign currency forward contracts that have been designated as cash flow hedges under the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging to partially offset our business exposure to foreign exchange risk on portions of our anticipated foreign currency revenue  costs of revenue  and certain operating expenses 
the objective of these foreign currency forward contracts is to reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results by offsetting gains and losses on the forward contracts with increases or decreases in foreign currency transactions 
the contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis with gains and losses included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations  and in cumulative other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
hedging of our balance sheet and anticipated cash flow exposures may not always be effective to protect us against currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  we do not fully hedge our balance sheet and anticipated cash flow exposures  leaving us at risk to foreign exchange gains and losses on the un hedged exposures 
if there were an adverse movement in exchange rates  we might suffer significant losses 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on our foreign currency contracts  which are hereby incorporated by reference into this part ii  item a 
as of december   we had net assets in various local currencies 
a hypothetical movement in foreign exchange rates would result in an after tax positive or negative impact of  to net income  net of our hedged position  at december  actual future gains and losses associated with our foreign currency exposures and positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of december  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the foreign currency exchange rates  and our actual exposures and positions 
for the year ended december   of total net revenue was denominated in a currency other than the us dollar
