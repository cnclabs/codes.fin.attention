item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
management overview fiscal year was a record year comprised of four record quarters 
we believe the continued growth of our pharmaceutical software and services business segment is the result of increasing adoption of simulation and modeling software tools such as those we produce  as well as the expertise we offer as consultants to assist companies involved in the research and development of new medicines  which has resulted in a continuing series of study contracts with pharmaceutical companies ranging from several of the largest in the world to a number of medium sized and smaller companies in the us and europe 
during fy we released major upgrades to three of our four pharmaceutical software offerings  we made substantial progress on our sbir grant from the nih  and we further expanded our life sciences staff 
our financial performance enabled us to continue to increase our cash deposits  remain debt free  and continue to invest in the aggressive marketing and sales activities we began in early in order to reach a wider customer base 
we have not been successful in identifying and completing any acquisitions in spite of a number of investigations and due diligence activities 
in each case  either due diligence revealed undesirable aspects of the potential acquisition  or terms and conditions agreeable to both sides were not able to be reached 
it is our intent to continue to search for acquisition opportunities that would be compatible with our current businesses and that would be immediately accretive  ie  adding to both revenues and earnings 
we have used some of our cash to repurchase shares of our common stock because we believe that reducing the number of fully diluted shares provides greater value to our shareholders than receiving a low interest rate on cash deposits  and because we believe that our cash deposits after such repurchases remain sufficient to accomplish any reasonable potential acquisitions as well as to maintain sufficient cash reserves to ensure meeting operational needs for the foreseeable future 
our words subsidiary has begun to turn around 
although the results for the entire fy were slightly negative  the fourth fiscal quarter resulted in a profit of over  driven partly by the introduction of our new eyepro eyegaze system in may we expect this trend to continue going forward  however  there can be no assurances that it will 
results of operations the following sets forth selected items from our statements of operations in thousands and the percentages that such items bear to net sales for the fiscal years ended august  fy and august  fy 
fy fy net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense miscellaneous income gain on sale of assets gain on currency exchange total other income net income before taxes provision for income taxes net income fy compared with fy net sales consolidated net sales increased  or  to  in fy from  in fy sales from pharmaceutical software and services increased approximately  or  and words s sales increased approximately  or  for the year 
we attribute the increase in pharmaceutical software sales to increases in the number of licenses with new and existing customers  as well as licensing of new modules to existing customers 
a price increase on pharmaceutical software products instituted in the second quarter with the effect being seen primarily in the rd and th quarters is an additional factor re sulting in increased revenues  accounting for approximately of the  increase 
the other increase is a result of increases in number of software licenses  study contracts  and grant revenue 
we attribute the increase in words sales to our conversa product with preloaded say it sam software and our new eyepro product 
increased revenues from these products outweighed decreased revenues from other products 
cost of sales consolidated cost of sales increased  or  to  in fy from  in fy  however  as a percentage of revenue  cost of sales decreased 
for pharmaceutical software and services  cost of sales increased  or  however  as a percentage of revenue  cost of sales decreased to in fy from in fy a significant portion of cost of sales for pharmaceutical software products is the systematic amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is an independent fixed cost rather than a variable cost related to sales 
this amortization cost increased approximately  or  in fy compared with fy royalty expense  another significant portion of cost of sales  increased approximately  or  in fy compared with fy we pay a royalty on gastroplus basic software sales but not on its modules 
we also pay royalties on the enslein metabolism module in our admet predictor software in accordance with our agreement with enslein research  inc for words  cost of sales increased  or  and as a percentage of revenue  cost of sales were almost the same with a slight decrease of to in fy from in fy gross profit consolidated gross profit increased  or  to  in fy from  in fy we attribute this increase to increased sales of pharmaceutical software and services in addition to increased sales of words products  which was greater than the increase in cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fy increased by  or  to  compared to  for fy as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased to from in fy for simulations plus  sg a expenses increased  or 
as a percentage of sales  sg a for simulations plus decreased to from 
the major increases in expenses were accounting fees incurred for filing of amended tax returns  valuation services and travel expenses associated with investigating potential acquisitions  investor relations  selling expenses as we continue to attend more trade shows  and salary and payroll related expenses 
for words  expenses increased by  or due to increases in travel  commissions  salaries and payroll related expenses 
these increases outweighed decreased in allowances for bad debts 
research and development we incurred approximately  of research and development r d costs during fy of this amount   was capitalized and  was expensed as r d 
as we record hours spent for studies   was expensed as cost of sales 
during fy we incurred approximately  of research and development costs  of which approximately  was capitalized and approximately  was expensed 
the hours spent for studies during fy was expensed as cost of sales which amounted  the increase in research and development expenditure from fy to fy was due to new hires and salary increases for existing employees  which outweighed a reduced allocation of part of our ceo s salary that had been spent on r d  reflecting changes in his activities to a greater focus on business development and other administrative duties 
income from operations during fy  we generated income from operations of  as compared to  for fy  an increase of 
we attribute this increase to increases in revenue from both pharmaceutical software and services and words operations  and a decrease in r d expenses  which was greater than the increases in cost of goods sold  sg a expenses  and selling and general administrative expenses 
other income and expense the net of other income over other expense for fy increased by  or  to  compared to  for fy this is due to increased interest income on money market accounts and gains on currency exchange 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for fy increased by  or  to  compared to  for fy due to our estimation of higher provision for income tax in fy the tax rate used in this report is lower than the standard rate because of various tax credits generated during this reporting period 
net income net income for fy increased by  or  to  compared to  for fy we attribute this increase in net income to increased sales for both companies and other income  and decreased r d expense which was greater than the increases in cost of goods sold  sg a expenses  and taxes 
seasonality sales in the pharmaceutical products and services business segment simulations plus in the table below exhibit some seasonal fluctuations  with the fourth fiscal quarter june august generally having the lowest sales over the past three fiscal years because of summer vacations and reduced activities at our customer s sites 
this unaudited net sales information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual information presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k and  in the opinion of management  reflects all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair presentation of the information presented 
net sales for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period  however  because our pharmaceutical software is l icensed on an annual basis  renewals are almost always within the same quarter year after year 
net simulations plus sales in thousands fy first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total sales of our disability products business segment words to schools were slightly seasonal prior to our fiscal year ended august   with greater sales to schools during our third and fourth fiscal quarter march may and june august  as shown in the table below 
net words sales in thousands fy first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total liquidity and capital resources our principal source of capital has been the cash flow from our operations 
we have achieved continuous positive operating cash flow over the last eight fiscal years 
we believe that our existing capital and anticipated funds from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements  we may open a revolving line of credit with a bank  or we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain expanded credit facilities 
in the event such financing is needed in the future  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us  or  if available  that it will be in amounts and on t erms acceptable to us 
if cash flows from operations became insufficient to continue operations at the current level  and if no additional financing was obtained  then management would restructure the company in a way to preserve its pharmaceutical and disability businesses while maintaining expenses within operating cash flows 
we are not aware of any trends or demands  commitments  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in liquidity of our assets 
the trend over the last eight years has been increasing cash deposits from our operating cash flows  and we expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of the end of the latest fiscal period 
we plan to continue our share repurchase program through the ending date of february   however  the exact amount of shares to be repurchased will depend on current market conditions and share prices on the nasdaq stock exchange 
if we repurchase all of the remaining  authorized shares as of november  prior to february   at the current share price as of november   approximately million in cash would be used 
this would be offset by the additional cash flow  if any  generated from operations prior to february  we continue to seek opportunities for strategic acquisitions 
if one or more such acquisition is identified  a substantial portion of our cash reserves may be required to complete it  however  we intend to maintain sufficient cash reserves after any acquisition to provide reasonable assurance that outside financing will not be necessary to continue operations 
if we identify an attractive acquisition that would require more cash to complete than we are willing or able to use from our cash reserves  we will consider financing options to complete the acquisition  including obtaining loans and issuing additional securities 
unusual or infrequent events there have been no unusual or infrequent events or other significant economic changes that have affected reported income 
known trends or uncertainties we are not aware of any trends or uncertainties expected to impact net sales or revenues from continuing operations 
the recent trend toward consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry has not had a negative effect on our sales to that industry  and we believe that the need for improved productivity in the research and development activities directed toward developing new medicines will continue to result in increasing adoption of simulation and modeling tools such as those we produce 
for words  the ability of government agencies to continue to fund assistive technology for the disabled may be impacted by the current financial difficulties within federal  state  and local governments  however  we are not aware of any reductions in such funding to date 
new product developments in both the pharmaceutical and disability business segments could result in increased revenues and earnings if they are accepted by our markets  however  there can be no assurances that new products will result in significant improvements to revenues or earnings 
for competitive reasons  we do not disclose all of our new product development activities 
our continued quest for acquisitions in the pharmaceutical business segment could result in a significant change to revenues and earnings if one or more such acquisitions is completed 
it is our intent to only complete acquisitions that would add to both revenues and earnings  however  there can be no assurances that any acquisitions that may be completed will in fact result in both increased revenues and earnings 
effect of changing prices a price increase on most of our pharmaceutical software products instituted in january has resulted in a contribution to increased revenues in that business segment 
we attribute approximately of the increased revenues in the pharmaceutical business segment for the fourth fiscal quarter of fy to these price increases  and the remaining to new business 
inflation we have not been affected materially by inflation during the periods presented  and no material effect is expected in the near future 
off balance sheet arrangements as of august   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu which amends statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  to exclude tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
asu applies to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early application permitted with emerging issues task force eitf we expect to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact asu will have on our consolidated fin ancial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
asu amends eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to require an entity to use an estimated selling price when vendor specific objective evidence or acceptable third party evidence does not exist for any products or services included in a multiple element arrangement 
the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the products and services based upon their relative selling prices  thus eliminating the use of the residual method of allocation 
asu also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding significant judgments made and changes in applying the guidance 
 asu applies to fiscal years beginning after june   with early application permitted 
we expect to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  accounting for capitalized software development costs  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue related to software licenses and software maintenance in accordance with the fasb accounting standard codification asc product revenue is recorded when the following conditions are met evidence of arrangement exists  such as signed purchase orders from customers or executed contracts  delivery has been made  such as unlocking the software on the customer s computer s  the amount is fixed  and it is collectible 
post contract customer support pcs obligations are insignificant  therefore  revenue for pcs is recognized at the same time  and the costs of providing such support services are accrued and amortized over the obligation period 
as a byproduct of ongoing improvements and upgrades to our software  some modifications are provided to customers who have already licensed software during their license term at no additional charge 
we consider these modifications to be minimal  as they are not changing the basic functionality or utility of the software  but rather adding convenience  such as being able to plot some additional variable on a graph in addition to the numerous variables that had been available before 
such software modifications for any single product have been typically once or twice per year  sometimes more  sometimes less 
thus  they are infrequent 
we provide  for a fee  additional training and service calls to our customers and recognize revenue at the time the training or service call is provided 
we enter into one year license agreements with most of our customers for the use of our pharmaceutical software products 
however  from time to time  we enter into multi year license agreements 
we unlock and invoice software one year at a time for multi year licenses 
therefore  revenue is recognized one year at a time 
we recognize contract study revenue either equally over the term of the contract or using the percentage of completion method  depending upon how the contract studies are engaged  in accordance with fasb asc to recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method  we must determine whether we meet the following criteria there is a long term  legally enforceable contract  it is possible to reasonably estimate the total project costs  and it is possible to reasonably estimate the extent of progress toward completion 
capitalized computer software development costs software development costs are capitalized in accordance with fasb asc capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and is discontinued when the product is available for sale 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment for recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors including  but not limited to  technological feasibility  anticipated future gross revenues  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
capitalized software development costs are comprised primarily of salaries and direct payroll related costs and the purchase of existing software to be used in our software products 
amortization of capitalized software development costs is provided on a product by product basis on the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the products not to exceed five years 
amortization of software development costs amounted to  and  for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
we expect future amortization expense to vary due to increases in capitalized computer software development costs 
we test capitalized computer software costs for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable within a reasonable time 
income taxes we utilize fasb asc which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the provision for income taxes represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock options using the modified prospective method in accordance with fasb asc under this method  compensation costs includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
amortized over the options vesting period  and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of simulations plus  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  words  inc all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  accounting for capitalized software development costs  and accounting for income taxes 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable because the company is a smaller reporting company
