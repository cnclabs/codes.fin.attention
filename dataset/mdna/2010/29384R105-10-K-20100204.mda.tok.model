table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information under part ii  item  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under part i  item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview entropic communications is a leading fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets systems solutions to enable connected home entertainment 
our technologies significantly change the way sd and hd video and other multimedia content such as movies  music  games and photos are brought into and delivered throughout the home 
our products include home networking chipsets based on the moca standard  high speed broadband access chipsets  integrated circuits that simplify and enhance digital broadcast satellite services and silicon tuner integrated circuits 
we use our considerable experience with service provider based deployments to create solutions that address the complex requirements associated with delivering multiple streams of hd video into and throughout the home  while seamlessly coexisting with video  voice and data services that are using the same coaxial cable infrastructure 
in december  we introduced and commenced commercial shipments of our home networking products 
in the first quarter of  we began commercially shipping our broadband access solutions 
in may  we acquired arabella software ltd  or arabella  a developer of embedded software 
in june  we acquired rf magic  a provider of digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit and silicon tuner solutions 
in  we acquired certain specified assets of vativ technologies  inc  or vativ  a provider of high bandwidth  advanced digital processing solutions for digital television and gigabit ethernet markets 
since inception  we have invested heavily in product development and have not yet achieved profitability on an annual basis  although we had net income of million for the three months ended december  our net revenues grew from million in to million in driven primarily by increased demand for our home networking products 
our net revenues decreased to million in driven primarily by softness in demand for our home networking products and  to a lesser extent  by lower demand for our dbs products 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we generate net revenues principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
we also generate service net revenues from development contracts 
we principally sell our products directly to either odms or oems 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and reduce the price of our products over time  as market and competitive conditions change  and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our markets are generally characterized by declining average selling prices over the life of a product and  accordingly  we must reduce costs and successfully introduce new products and enhancements to maintain our gross margins 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenues 
sales to these customers are in turn driven by service providers that purchase our customers products which incorporate our products 
substantially all of our net revenues are dependent upon three major service providers  verizon through its fios deployment  dish network and directv 
in addition  we are dependent on sales outside of the united states for almost all of our net revenues and expect that to continue in the future 

table of contents we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
this outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  sales and marketing of our products and avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility 
a significant portion of our cost of net revenues consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for manufacturing  assembly and test services 
we expect research and development expenses in future years to continue to increase in total dollars as we develop additional products and expand our business  and to fluctuate over the course of the year based on the timing of our fabrication mask costs 
we also anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our domestic and international sales and marketing organization and activities and build brand awareness 
due to the lengthy sales cycles that we face  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur research and development and sales and marketing expenses until the time  if ever  that we generate sales from the related products 
since our inception  we have funded our operations using a combination of preferred stock issuances  cash collections from customers  bank credit facilities  cash received from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our initial public offering 
we intend to continue spending substantial amounts in connection with the growth of our business and we may need to obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy  develop new products  respond to competition and market opportunities  and acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  warranty accrual  inventory valuation  stock based compensation  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for income taxes  and estimation of fair value of warrants to purchase preferred stock 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenues when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is 
table of contents reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment  however  we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met  when applicable 
a portion of our sales is made through distributors  agents or customers acting as agents  some of with which we have agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
product net revenues on sales made through these distributors are not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
we record reductions to net revenues for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and other factors known at the time 
if actual returns differ significantly from our estimates  such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
to date  changes in estimated returns have not been material to net revenues in any related period 
we are party to an inventory hubbing arrangement with a key customer 
pursuant to this arrangement  we deliver products to the designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer removes our products from the third party warehouse to incorporate into its own products 
we derive revenues from development contracts that involve new and unproven technologies 
revenues under these contracts are deferred until customer acceptance is obtained and other contract specific terms have been completed 
provisions for losses related to development contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
the costs associated with development contracts are included in cost of service revenue 
we defer the cost of services provided under our development contracts 
as of december  and  we did not have any capitalized contract costs in inventory 
we receive royalties in exchange for an exclusive right to manufacture and sell certain products 
we have determined that we are not able to reliably estimate the royalties earned in the period the sales occur 
thus  we record net revenues based on cash receipts 
the royalty revenues recorded during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and are included in net revenues on the accompanying statements of operations 
we also have entered into arrangements to license our hardware and software  also referred to as the nodes  to certain members of moca for a period of three years and to provide upgrades when and if they become available 
the agreements limit the rights to use the nodes to test compliance of the members own products to the moca specification 
for these arrangements  we defer all of the license revenues when the nodes are delivered and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over the three year term 
we provide rebates on our products to certain customers 
at the time of the sale  we accrue of the potential rebate as a reduction to revenue and do not apply a breakage factor 
the amount of these reductions is based upon the terms included in various rebate agreements 
we reverse the accrual for unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
for the years ended december   and  we reduced net revenue by million  million and  respectively  in connection with our rebate programs 
we allocate revenue for transactions that include multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value and recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the price charged when the element is sold separately generally 
table of contents determines fair value 
when we have objective evidence of the fair values of undelivered elements but not delivered elements  we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue is then allocated to the delivered elements 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered or services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
warranty accrual we generally provide a warranty on our products for a period of one year  however  it may be longer for certain customers 
accordingly  we establish provisions for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based upon our historical activity and  additionally  for any known product warranty issues 
warranty provisions are recorded as a cost of net revenues 
the determination of such provisions requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to replace or rework the products under warranty 
when the actual product failure rates  cost of replacements and rework costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual are made 
actual claims are charged against the warranty reserve 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include costs related to personnel and third party services  which consist primarily of contract labor services  fabrication masks  architecture licenses  engineering design development software and hardware tools  allocated support expenses and depreciation of equipment used in research and development 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable  leases payable and lines of credit 
our policy is to place our cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions in order to limit our credit exposure 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and a cash deposit is generally not required 
we estimate potential losses on trade receivables on an ongoing basis 
we invest cash in deposits and money market funds with major financial institutions  us government obligations and debt securities of corporations with investment grade credit ratings in a variety of industries 
it is our policy to invest in instruments that have a final maturity of no longer than two years  and to maintain a portfolio weighted average maturity of no longer than months 
guarantees and indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into agreements with customers that include indemnity provisions 
to date  there have been no known events or circumstances that have resulted in any significant costs related to these indemnification provisions and  as a result  no liabilities have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
lower of cost or market adjustments reduce the carrying value of the related inventory and take into consideration reductions in sales prices  excess inventory levels and obsolete inventory 
these adjustments are calculated on a part by part basis and  in general  represent excess inventory value on hand compared to month 
table of contents demand projections 
once established  these adjustments are considered permanent and are not reversed until the related inventory is sold or disposed 
stock based compensation we have stock incentive plans under which incentive stock options have been granted to employees and restricted stock units and non qualified stock options have been granted to employees and non employees 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees 
our stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we have no stock based compensation awards with market or performance conditions 
the stock based compensation expense attributable to awards under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
we also grant awards to non employees and determine the fair value of such stock based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
if the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used  it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached  or the date at which the counterparty s performance is completed 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with stock based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach excluding any indirect effects to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
the following assumptions are used to value options and awards granted under our equity incentive plans for the years ended december   and employee stock options years ended december  expected life years risk free interest rate to to expected volatility to to to expected dividend yield the weighted average grant date fair value per share of employee stock options granted during the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense related to employees for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the total intrinsic value of outstanding options as of december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the stock options granted to non employees was estimated using the black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense related to non employees for the years ended december   and was  million and million  respectively 
in may  we completed an offer to exchange  or the offer to exchange  certain employee stock options to purchase shares of our common stock that were outstanding under our equity 
table of contents incentive plan  or the plan  plan  and rf magic plan on a three for two basis for replacement options granted under the plan at an exercise price of per share  which was the closing price of our common stock on may   as reported by the nasdaq global market 
at the expiration of the offer to exchange  we accepted elections to exchange options to purchase  shares of common stock and  as a result  we granted replacement options to purchase  shares of common stock 
the replacement options have new vesting schedules with vesting dates that are determined by adding an additional vesting period of months  or a shorter duration upon a change of control  to each vesting date under the existing vesting schedule of the options being replaced  however  no replacement option will vest sooner than months from its date of grant  unless a change of control occurs 
the incremental value attributed to the option awards exchanged resulted in approximately  of stock based compensation  which will be recognized over the vesting period of the new option awards 
goodwill and intangible assets we record goodwill and other intangible assets based on the fair value of the assets acquired 
in determining the fair value of the assets acquired  we utilize extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired 
the estimates used to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
we assess goodwill and certain intangible assets for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
we perform an interim goodwill impairment test when it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount 
we operate as one reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including the size and timing of deployments by our customers and related projections and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  stage of products in development  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
during the three months ended march   we implemented a restructuring plan as described in greater detail in note to the notes of the consolidated financial statement included in this annual report 
as part of the restructuring plan  we closed our kfar saba  israel office and terminated all of the employees at that location 
as a result of this location closure  we reassessed the intangible assets associated with our kfar saba  israel office and recorded an impairment charge for the remaining million of developed technology intangible assets associated with our acquisition of arabella 
during december  we lowered the business outlook and both of our revenue and cash flow projections primarily due to the delay of additional service providers in deploying our products and the longer term exposure associated with worsening general economic conditions 
we also saw our market valuation significantly decrease during the fourth quarter of as our share price decreased 
table of contents from at september  to at december  additionally  as a result of the depressed macroeconomic environment and resulting declines in equity values  we saw a perceived increase in the discount rate used in computing the values of the lowered projected cash flows 
this resulted in a discount rate of when we calculated our discounted cash flows attributable to the intangible assets 
as a result of the above impairment indicators  we performed an impairment analysis 
fair value in the impairment analysis was calculated using the expected discounted future cash flows 
expected future cash flows are estimated over the related assets remaining estimated useful lives and consist of the estimated net revenues and expenses associated with those assets 
we determined the estimated future cash flow streams from the various intangible assets were largely independent of one another and  accordingly  estimated future cash flows by individual intangible asset were projected 
in connection with our impairment analysis during the quarter ended december   we determined that goodwill and certain intangible assets were impaired and  accordingly  recorded an impairment charge of million and million  respectively 
we determined our fixed assets were not impaired and therefore a charge was not recorded 
purchase price amounts assigned to acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  are expensed immediately 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded write offs of ipr d of  million and million  respectively 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we also follow accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in any period 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense 
we estimate current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   due to a change in the tax law related to the use of net operating loss 
table of contents carrybacks  we have recorded a receivable for alternative minimum taxes paid in a prior year 
as of the same date  we recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our remaining deferred tax assets  based on the available evidence  as we believed at that time it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize these deferred tax assets in the future 
we intend to maintain the full valuation allowances until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
if our business opportunities outside the united states continue to grow  we may expand our international operations and staff to better support our expansion into international markets 
we anticipate that this expansion would include the implementation of an international organizational structure that could result in an increasing percentage of our consolidated pre tax income being derived from  and reinvested in  our international operations 
we anticipate that this pre tax income would be subject to foreign tax at relatively lower tax rates when compared to the us federal statutory tax rate and as a consequence  our future effective income tax rate may be lower than the us federal statutory rate 
as of december   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire beginning in and  respectively 
as of the same date  we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credit carryforward will expire commencing in while the state of california research tax credits will continue in effect indefinitely 
utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the tax benefits related to future utilization of federal and state net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be limited or lost if cumulative changes in ownership exceed within any three year period 
we have completed an analysis of the impact of our acquisition of rf magic and prior changes in ownership of entropic and rf magic and have determined that such changes in ownership have resulted in limitations on the amount of the companies net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may be utilized in the future  however  we do not anticipate that such annual limitations will preclude the utilization of substantially all of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards described above in the event we become profitable 
our ability to utilize these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be further limited by changes in ownership  the implementation of an international organizational structure  the issuance of common stock in future common stock offerings or transactions  or other future events 
additional limitations on the use of these tax attributes could occur in the event of disputes arising in examinations by various taxing authorities 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
on january   we adopted guidance that prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax year 
for the year ended december   we had recorded a cumulative reserve of approximately million which was recorded as a decrease to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction to the valuation allowance 

table of contents acquisitions year ended december  we made no acquisitions during the year ended december  year ended december  in april  we acquired certain specified assets of vativ  including vativ s intellectual property rights  existing product lines  inventory and equipment 
we paid million in cash for the acquired assets 
the results of operations of vativ have been included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
the acquired assets did not include vativ s cash  cash equivalents  investments or any portion of vativ s accounts receivable 
we assumed certain liabilities of vativ equal to million  including current accounts payable and accrued vacation liabilities for the former employees of vativ hired by us 
in addition  we committed to pay cash retention bonuses in the aggregate amount of million to employees hired from vativ in connection with the acquisition earned over the first days of employment 
the retention bonuses were recorded as expense during the service period and were not included in the assumed liabilities 
in july and january  we paid million and million  respectively  for these retention bonuses 
year ended december  in may  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of arabella in exchange for  shares of our common stock and other consideration for a total purchase price of million 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of rf magic in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
except for stock options held by employees of rf magic s french subsidiary  we also assumed each outstanding option to purchase rf magic common stock and converted these options into options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
pursuant to put and call option agreements  as of december   we may issue up to  shares of our common stock in exchange for the shares of rf magic s common stock issuable upon exercise of the unassumed options 
we also assumed outstanding warrants to purchase rf magic common and preferred stock and converted them into warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price for the rf magic acquisition was million 
the securities we issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the rf magic acquisition represented of the combined company s fully diluted capitalization as of the closing date of the acquisition including shares available for issuance under equity incentive plans and assuming conversion of all outstanding preferred stock and exercise of all outstanding stock options and warrants

we generate net revenues principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
we also generate service revenues from development contracts 
we principally sell our products directly to either odms or oems 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions  and periodically reduce the price of our products as market and competitive conditions change and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our markets are generally characterized by declining average selling prices over the life of a product and  accordingly  we must reduce costs and successfully introduce new products and enhancements to maintain our gross margins 
we currently rely  and expect to continue to rely  on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenues 
for the years ended december  and  four customers accounted for and of our net revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   three customers accounted for of our net revenues 
in addition  we depend on a limited number of service providers that purchase products from our customers that incorporate our products 
to date  only a limited number of major service providers  such as verizon  directv  time warner  cox and bhn have publicly announced their intention to use the moca standard for home networking 
we also primarily rely on two major service providers  dish network and directv  to deploy products using our dbs outdoor unit solutions 
during the year ended december   products sold to our customers that were incorporated into products purchased by verizon  dish network and directv accounted for substantially all of our net revenues 
to date  the fios deployment by verizon has been a major driver of our net revenues 
we expect that we will continue to derive significant revenues from verizon  but our reliance on verizon as a major driver of our net revenues is decreasing as other service providers  such as directv  deploy our home networking products 
since inception  we have derived our net revenues primarily from asia and north america

cost of net revenues 
we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
a significant portion of our cost of net revenues consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for manufacturing  assembly and test services 
to a lesser extent  cost of net revenues includes expenses relating to management of our contractors  the cost of shipping and logistics  royalties  inventory valuation charges taken for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs  changes in product cost due to changes in wafer manufacturing  assembly and test yields  allocated facilities expenses  amortization of inventory step up and acquired developed technology 
we currently outsource the manufacturing of our home networking and broadband access products principally to tsmc and the manufacturing of our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit and silicon tuner products to towerjazz 
our home networking and broadband access products are primarily assembled and tested by amkor  while our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit and silicon tuner products are primarily assembled by amkor and tested by giga solution 
we do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity from any of our subcontractors facilities to produce our products 
gross margin 
our gross margins increased year to year from to  primarily due to decreased unit costs of our home networking chipsets principally as a result of more favorable manufacturing costs and the addition of net revenues as a result of our acquisition of rf magic 
included in cost of net revenues for and was the amortization of developed technology of million and million  respectively  which resulted from the rf magic and vativ acquisitions 
included in cost of net revenues for was the amortization of the inventory step up of million that resulted from the rf magic acquisition 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including declines in selling prices of our products  especially as competition increases over time  product mix  the timing of cost reductions for fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs  inventory valuation charges  purchase accounting related charges  and changes in wafer manufacturing  assembly and test yields 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses primarily include costs related to personnel  third party services that consist primarily of contract labor services  fabrication masks  architecture licenses  engineering design development software and hardware tools  allocated facilities expenses and depreciation of equipment used in research and development 
while a substantial portion of our research and development activities are undertaken in support of our current and anticipated customers  we also invest in research and development to develop our technology 
in the future  we expect some of the services currently performed by contractors to be performed internally 
we expect research and development expenses in future years to continue to increase in total dollars 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses may fluctuate over the course of a year based on the timing of our development tools and supply costs  which include third party services  masks costs and licenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include costs related to personnel  sales commissions  trade shows  marketing programs  depreciation and allocated facilities 
table of contents expenses 
we plan to continue to increase the size of our sales and marketing organization to enable us to expand into existing and new markets 
we also plan to continue to invest in expanding our domestic and international sales and marketing activities and building brand awareness 
due to the lengthy sales cycles that we face  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur research and development and sales expenses until the time  if ever  that we generate sales from these products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily include costs related to personnel  accounting and tax  legal compliance and allocated support expenses 
we expect that in future years our general and administrative expenses will increase as we incur additional costs associated with supporting our business growth 
gain on fair value of warrant liabilities 
gain on fair value of warrant liabilities reflects the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities calculated at the end of each reporting period 
upon the closing of our initial public offering in december  warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock that remained outstanding converted to warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and  as a result  are no longer subject to fair value adjustment 
at that time  the then current aggregate fair value of these warrants was reclassified from current liabilities to additional paid in capital  and we ceased to record any related periodic fair value adjustments 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
our net revenues for were million  as compared to net revenues of million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in net revenues for was primarily driven by lower demand for our home networking products and  to a lesser extent  from lower demand of dbs outdoor unit chips 
gross profit gross margin 
our gross profit and gross margin are impacted by the inclusion of amortization of developed technology in cost of net revenues 
the amortization results from our acquisitions of rf magic and vativ as we used the purchase method of accounting and  as a result of the application of the purchase method  included in cost of net revenues for and was million and million  respectively  of amortization of developed technology  or a decrease of million 
gross profit for was million  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit of million in this decrease was primarily due to lower net revenues from the sales of our home networking chipsets and our dbs outdoor unit products  offset by lower amortization in the developed technology and improvement in the gross margin of our home networking chipsets 
gross margin increased from for to for primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of developed technology 
additionally  gross margin increased due to lower unit costs of our home networking chipsets  principally as a result of more favorable manufacturing costs  and slightly higher contribution to gross margin from the sales of our dbs outdoor unit products

recently issued accounting standards in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  amended authoritative guidance which addresses the initial recognition  measurement and subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination  and requires that such assets acquired or liabilities assumed be initially recognized at fair value at the acquisition date if fair value can be determined during the measurement period 
if the fair value as of the acquisition date cannot be determined  the asset acquired or liability assumed arising from a contingency is recognized only if certain criteria are met 
this guidance also requires that a systematic and rational basis for subsequently measuring and accounting for the assets or liabilities be developed depending on their nature 
this guidance is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is during or after we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements  absent any material business combinations 
in april  the fasb amended existing guidance on determining whether an impairment for investments in debt securities is other than temporary 
we adopted the revised guidance on a prospective basis beginning april  the application of the revised guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance establishing general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur subsequent to the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued  which we adopted on a prospective basis beginning april  the guidance requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for selecting that date 
the application of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after november   with earlier adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements  absent any variable interest entities which require consolidation 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance establishing the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the guidance provides for the fasb accounting standards codification  or codification  to become the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental gaap 
the codification did not change gaap but reorganizes the literature 
the application of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides clarification for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available 
the guidance is intended to reduce potential ambiguity in financial reporting when measuring the fair value of liabilities 
the guidance was effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after issuance 
the application of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the guidance will allow companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics 
the guidance also removes non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products from the scope of existing software revenue guidance 
the new guidance requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption of the guidance is permitted 
we have adopted this guidance effective january  and anticipate that the application of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales have been historically denominated in us dollars and an increase in the value of us dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which our customers operate could materially affect the demand of our non us customers for our products  leading to a reduction in orders placed by these customers  which would adversely affect our business 
our international sales and marketing operations incur expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these expenses could be materially affected by currency fluctuations  however  we do not consider this currency risk to be material as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total spending 
we outsource our wafer manufacturing  assembly  testing  warehousing and shipping operations  however all expenses related thereto are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar decreases relative to the currencies of the countries in which such contractors operate  the prices we are charged for their services may increase  which would adversely affect our business 
currently  we have not implemented any hedging strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

table of contents interest rate risk we typically maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in deposits and money market funds with major financial institutions  us government obligations and debt securities of corporations with strong credit ratings in a variety of industries that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
a change in market interest rates of annualized would have impacted our net income from these investments by million for the year ended december  cash equivalents and marketable securities risk our cash equivalents and marketable securities  consisting of us treasury and agency obligations  commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  time deposits  foreign notes and certificates of deposits  are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
in the past  certain of our short term marketable securities were classified as available for sale and were stated at fair value  which was equal to cost due to the short term maturity of these securities 
in the event that there were to be a difference between fair value and cost in any of our available for sale securities  unrealized gains and losses on these investments would be reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our investment policy for marketable securities requires that all securities mature in two years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than months 
as of december   we did not carry any of these securities  but we may do so in the future 
the fair value of marketable securities we may purchase fluctuates based on changes in market conditions and interest rates and is affected by the credit condition of the us financial sector 
absent the unprecedented turmoil and upheaval in the us financial sector  given the short term maturities of marketable securities we may purchase  we do not believe these instruments to be subject to significant market or interest rate risk 
however  the current unstable credit environment of the us financial sector may lead us to incur significant realized  unrealized or impairment losses associated with our investments 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 

table of contents the carrying value  maturity and estimated fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and  respectively  were as follows in thousands  except interest rates carrying value as of december  maturity fair value as of december  investments cash equivalents weighted average yield carrying value as of december  maturity fair value as of december  investments cash equivalents weighted average yield marketable securities weighted average yield
