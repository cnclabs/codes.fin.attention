park or the company is a global advanced materials company which develops  manufactures  markets and sells high technology digital and rf microwave printed circuit materials products principally for the telecommunications and internet infrastructure and high end computing markets and advanced composite materials products and composite parts and assemblies products principally for the aerospace markets 
park s core capabilities are in the areas of polymer chemistry formulation and coating technology 
park also specializes in the design and manufacture of complex composite aircraft and space vehicle parts 
the company s manufacturing facilities are located in singapore  china  france  connecticut  kansas  arizona  california and washington 
the comparisons of the company s results of operations for its fiscal year ended march  to the company s results of operations for its fiscal year ended march  are impacted by the facts that the fiscal year consisted of weeks and the fiscal year consisted of weeks 
the company s total net sales declined in the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended march  as a result of decreases in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in north america  asia and europe  following a decline in the company s total net sales in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  as a result of decreases in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in all three regions 
while the decrease in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in the fiscal year was accompanied by decreases in sales of the company s advanced composite materials products and its composite parts and assemblies products in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  the decrease in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in the fiscal year was partially offset by an increase in sales of the company s advanced composite materials products in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year and by the addition of sales of the company s advanced composite parts and assemblies products as a result of the company s acquisition of the composite parts and assemblies business of nova composites in lynnwood  washington in the fiscal year first quarter 
despite the declines in the company s total net sales in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  the company s earnings from operations in the fiscal year were higher than in the fiscal year as the company s gross profit margins  measured as percentages of sales  improved to in the fiscal year compared to in the fiscal year 
the company s operating and earnings performances during the fiscal year benefited from higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials during the fiscal year and lower costs resulting from the workforce reductions at the nelco products  inc  neltec  inc 
and nelco products pte 
ltd 
business units and the closures of the new england laminates co  inc and neltec europe sas business units in the fiscal year  all described elsewhere in this discussion 
gross profit margin improvements during the fiscal year were partially offset by costs incurred at the company s park aircraft technologies corp 
business unit in newton  kansas in connection with the start up of its operation 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year were lower than its net earnings for the fiscal year as a result of the lower net sales in the fiscal year and the significantly lower interest income in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year  and the company s net earnings for the fiscal year were significantly increased by the discontinued operations benefit of million described elsewhere in this discussion 
as a result of the declines in the company s total net sales in the compared to the fiscal year  the company s earnings from continuing operations were lower in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the significant decreases in sales of printed circuit materials products  combined with  among other things  substantial losses at the company s neltec europe sas electronic materials business unit in mirebeau  france  resulted in lower gross profits and lower earnings from continuing operations in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
the declines in the company s operating and earnings performances during the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year were partially offset by higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials products during the fiscal year and by the benefits resulting from the restructurings of the company s neltec europe sas and neltec sa business units in the fiscal year and from the workforce reductions at the nelco products  inc  neltec  inc

such resources would also be available for purchases of the company s common stock  appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company s business 
the company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity 
the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as lease agreements  consist only of the operating lease commitments  commitments to purchase equipment for the company s new development and manufacturing facility in newton  kansas and commitments to purchase plant for the expansion of such facility described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the company s obligation to pay up to an additional million over four years in connection with the acquisition of the assets and business of nova composites  inc  described above

environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in the  and fiscal years  the company reversed accruals of   and  respectively  for environmental remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs  which were recorded as reductions to selling  general and administrative expenses for such years  as a result of the company s conclusion that the likelihood of any liability in connection with such accruals was remote 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at february  and march   the amounts recorded in accrued liabilities for environmental matters were  and  respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates in response to financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december  the following information is provided regarding critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that entail  to a significant extent  the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of management s judgment 
general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to sales allowances  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  restructurings  contingencies and litigation  and pensions and other employee benefit programs 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
all material sales transactions are for the shipment of manufactured prepreg and laminate products and advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies 
sales allowances the company provides for the estimated costs of sales allowances at the time such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company s products are made to customer specifications and tested for adherence to such specifications before shipment to customers 
composite parts and assemblies may be subject to airworthiness acceptance by customers after receipt at the customers locations 
there are no future performance requirements other than the products meeting the agreed specifications 
the company s bases for providing sales allowances for returns are known situations in which products may have failed due to manufacturing defects in the products supplied by the company 
the company is focused on manufacturing the highest quality printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies possible and employs stringent manufacturing process controls and works with raw material suppliers who have dedicated themselves to complying with the company s specifications and technical requirements 
the amounts of returns and allowances resulting from defective or damaged products have been approximately of sales for each of the company s last three fiscal years 
allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are due within established payment terms and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than established payment terms are considered past due 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions about future demand for the company s products and market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  the company assesses the impairment of goodwill at least annually 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in the use of the company s assets or strategy of the overall business 
income taxes as part of the processes of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations  or conversely to further reduce the existing valuation allowance resulting in less income tax expense 
the company evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when  in the company s judgment  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances and when new information becomes available 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
the effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by the company 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate 
interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense 
restructurings the company recorded one time pre tax charges of million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  related to the closure of the company s new england laminates co  inc electronic materials business unit located in newburgh  new york and the closure of the company s neltec europe sas electronic materials business unit located in mirebeau  france and related to a workforce reduction and an asset impairment at the company s nelco products pte

contingencies the company is subject to a small number of proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  employment  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company is obligated to pay up to an additional million over four years depending on the achievement of specified earn out objectives in connection with the acquisition by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  park aerospace structures corp  of substantially all the assets and business of nova composites  inc  a manufacturer of composite parts and assemblies and the tooling for such parts and assemblies  located in lynnwood  washington  in addition to a cash purchase price of million paid at the closing of the acquisition on april  and a payment of million paid in the fiscal year second quarter 
pension and other employee benefit programs the company s obligations for workers compensation claims are effectively self insured  although the company maintains individual and aggregate stop loss insurance coverage for such claims 
the company accrues its workers compensation liability based on estimates of the total exposure of known claims using historical experience and projected loss development factors less amounts previously paid out 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries have a non contributory profit sharing retirement plan covering their regular full time employees 
in addition  the company s subsidiaries have various bonus and incentive compensation programs  some of which are determined at management s discretion 
the company s reserves associated with these self insured liabilities and benefit programs are reviewed by management for adequacy at the end of each reporting period
