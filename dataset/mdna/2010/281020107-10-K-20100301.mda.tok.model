both sce and eme are also subject to the reliability standards for the bulk power system required by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc 
edison international is not a public utility under the laws of the state of california or any other state and is not subject to regulation as such by the cpuc or any similar agency 
see southern california edison company regulation of sce below for a description of the regulation of sce by the cpuc 
the cpuc decision authorizing sce to reorganize into a holding company structure  however  contains certain conditions  which  among other things ensure cpuc access to books and records of edison international and its affiliates which relate to transactions with sce  require edison international and its subsidiaries to employ accounting and other procedures and controls to ensure full review by the cpuc and to protect against subsidization of nonutility activities by sce s customers  require that all transfers of market  technological  or similar data from sce to edison international or its affiliates be made at market value  preclude sce from guaranteeing any obligations of edison international without prior written consent from the cpuc  provide for royalty payments to be paid by edison international or its subsidiaries in connection with the transfer of product rights  patents  copyrights  or similar legal rights from sce  and prevent edison international and its subsidiaries from providing certain facilities and equipment to sce except through competitive bidding 
in addition  the decision provides that sce shall maintain a balanced capital structure in accordance with cpuc decisions  that sce s dividend policy shall continue to be established by sce s board of directors as though sce were a stand alone utility company  and that the capital requirements of sce  as deemed to be necessary to meet sce s service obligations  shall receive first priority from the boards of directors of edison international and sce 
the cpuc has also promulgated affiliate transaction rules  which contain similar restrictions that apply to edison international  as a holding company 
financial information about geographic areas financial information for geographic areas for edison international can be found in item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note business segments and note acquisitions 

table of contents southern california edison company regulation cpuc sce s retail operations are subject to regulation by the cpuc 
the cpuc has the authority to regulate  among other things  retail rates  energy purchases on behalf of retail customers  rate of return  rates of depreciation  issuance of securities  disposition of utility assets and facilities  oversight of nuclear decommissioning  and aspects of the construction  planning and project site identification of the electricity transmission system 
resource adequacy requirements the cpuc has established resource adequacy requirements  which require sce to procure adequate electricity to meet its expected customer needs on both a system wide and a local basis 
sce would be subject to penalties if it failed to meet the requirements 
sce complied with the resource adequacy requirements in and expects to comply in procurement of renewable resources california law requires sce to increase its procurement of energy from renewable resources by at least of its annual retail electricity sales per year so that of its annual electricity sales are procured from renewable resources by no later than december  or such later date as flexible compliance requirements may permit 
under the cpuc s current rules  the maximum penalty for inability to achieve renewable procurement targets is million per year 
sce s ability to meet the rps target depends largely on the ability of third parties to meet contractual obligations to deliver power to sce 
flexible compliance rules  such as banking of past surplus and earmarking of future deliveries from executed contracts  are also available 
sce does not believe it will be assessed penalties for or prior years and cannot predict whether it will be assessed penalties for future years 
ferc sce s wholesale operations including sales of electricity into the wholesale markets are subject to regulation by the ferc 
the ferc has the authority to regulate wholesale rates as well as other matters  including unbundled transmission service pricing  accounting practices  and licensing of hydroelectric projects 
cec the construction  planning  and project site identification of sce s power plants within california are subject to the jurisdiction of the california energy commission cec for plants mw or greater 
the cec is responsible for forecasting future energy needs 
these forecasts are used by the cpuc in determining the adequacy of sce s electricity procurement plans 
california law prohibits the cec from siting or permitting a new nuclear power plant in california until it finds a federally approved and demonstrated method for the disposal of nuclear waste 

table of contents nuclear power plant regulation sce is subject to the jurisdiction of the us nuclear regulatory commission nrc with respect to its san onofre and palo verde nuclear generating stations 
nrc requirements govern the granting  amendment  and extension of licenses for the construction and operation of nuclear power plants and subject those power plants to continuing oversight  inspection  and performance assessment with respect to plant operation and related activities 
san onofre is currently addressing a number of regulatory and performance issues 
the nrc is requiring sce to take actions to provide greater assurance of compliance by san onofre personnel with applicable nrc requirements and procedures 
sce is currently implementing plans to address the identified issues 
the nrc has continued to affirm that san onofre has been operated and is being operated safely  however  the cumulative impact of these regulatory and performance issues is an increase in management focus and other resources applied at san onofre 
information about nuclear decommissioning can be found in item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies and note commitments and contingencies 
information about nuclear insurance can be found in item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies 
transmission and substation facilities regulation the construction  planning and project site identification of sce s transmission lines and substation facilities require the approval of many governmental agencies and compliance with various laws 
these agencies include utility regulatory commissions such as the cpuc and other state regulatory agencies depending on the project location  the independent system operator iso  and other environmental  land management and resource agencies such as the bureau of land management  the us forest service  and the california department of fish and game  and regional water quality control boards 
in addition  to the extent that sce transmission line projects pass through lands owned or controlled by native american tribes  consent and approval from the affected tribes and the bureau of indian affairs will also be necessary for the project to proceed 
relationship with certain affiliated companies sce is subject to cpuc and ferc affiliate transaction rules and compliance plans governing the relationship between sce and its affiliates 
overview of ratemaking mechanisms sce sells electricity to retail customers at rates authorized by the cpuc 
sce sells transmission service and wholesale power at rates authorized by the ferc 
base rates base rates authorized by the cpuc and the ferc are intended to provide sce a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its net investment in generation  
table of contents transmission and distribution facilities or rate base 
these base rates provide for recovery of operations and maintenance costs  capital related carrying costs depreciation  taxes and interest and a return or profit  on a forecast basis 
cpuc base rates base rates for sce s generation and distribution functions provide a rate of return and are authorized by the cpuc through triennial grc proceedings 
the cpuc sets an annual revenue requirement for the base year which is made up of the carrying cost on capital investment depreciation  return and taxes  plus the authorized level of operation and maintenance expense 
the return is established by multiplying an authorized rate of return  determined in the separate cost of capital proceedings as discussed below  by the generation and distribution rate base 
in the grc proceedings  the cpuc also approves capital spending on a forecast basis 
adjustments to the revenue requirement for the remaining two years of a typical three year grc cycle are requested  based on criteria established in the grc proceeding  which generally  among other items  include annual allowances for escalation in operation and maintenance costs  forecasted changes in capital related investments and the timing and number of expected nuclear refueling outages 
sce s most recent grc decision for the period was issued in march and was effective as of january  sce expects to begin proceedings for the grc in the third quarter of as part of the grc  the cpuc has authorized a revenue decoupling mechanism  which allows for the difference between the revenue authorized and the actual volume of electricity sales to be collected from or refunded to ratepayers 
accordingly  sce does not bear the volumetric risk related to electricity sales 
the cpuc regulates sce s capital structure and authorized rate of return 
sce s current authorized capital structure is common equity  long term debt and preferred equity 
sce s current authorized cost of capital consists of cost of long term debt of  authorized cost of preferred equity of and authorized return on common equity of 
in  the cpuc approved a multi year cost of capital mechanism  which allows for annual adjustments if certain thresholds are reached 
sce s earnings may be impacted when actual financing costs are above or below its authorized costs for long term debt and preferred equity financings 
ferc base rates base rates for sce s transmission functions provide a rate of return and are authorized by the ferc  in periodic proceedings that are similar to the cpuc grc proceeding 
requested rate changes at the ferc are generally implemented before final approval of the application  with revenue collected prior to a final ferc decision being subject to refund 
ferc approved base rate revenues that vary from forecast are not subject to balancing account mechanisms  or otherwise recoverable or refundable and will therefore impact earnings 
cost recovery rates cost recovery mechanisms allow sce to recover its costs  but do not allow a return or profit 
these mechanisms are used to recover sce s costs of fuel  purchased power  demand side management programs  nuclear decommissioning  public purpose programs  certain operation 
table of contents and maintenance expenses  and depreciation expense related to certain projects 
although the cpuc authorizes balancing account mechanisms for such costs to refund or recover any differences between forecasted and actual costs  under or over collections in these balancing accounts do impact cash flows and can build rapidly 
the cpuc also uses a mechanism known as a balancing account to eliminate the effect on earnings that differences in revenue resulting from actual and forecast electricity sales may have 
under this mechanism  the difference in revenue between actual and forecast electricity sales is recovered from or refunded to ratepayers and therefore does not impact sce s earnings 
sce s balancing account for fuel and power procurement related costs is established under the energy resource recovery account erra mechanism 
sce files annual forecasts of the costs that it expects to incur during the following year and sets rates using forecasts 
the cpuc has established a trigger mechanism for the erra balancing account that allows for a rate adjustment if the balancing account over collection or under collection exceeds of sce s prior year s generation revenue 
the majority of costs eligible for recovery through cost recovery rates are subject to cpuc reasonableness reviews  and thus could negatively impact earnings and cash flows if found to be unreasonable and disallowed 
energy efficiency shareholder risk reward incentive mechanism the cpuc has adopted an energy efficiency risk reward incentive mechanism which allows for both financial incentives and economic penalties based on sce s performance toward meeting goals set by the cpuc for energy efficiency 
under this mechanism  sce has the opportunity to earn an incentive if it achieves or more of its energy efficiency goals for the three year period 
economic penalties would be imposed in the event sce achieves less than of its goals 
the mechanism allows for two annual progress payments  subject to holdback percentages  for progress towards meeting the goals and a third payment for final performance on the goals  which includes the payment of any holdbacks 
sce may retain the first and second progress payments as long as it meets a minimum of of the goals 
if sce does not meet the level  the amount of the progress payments and economic penalties would be deducted from future incentive payments 
both incentives and economic penalties for each three year period are capped at million 
in january  the cpuc issued a new rulemaking intended to review the framework of the energy efficiency risk reward incentive mechanism 
the cpuc has yet to release a decision on a new framework 
cdwr related rates as a result of the california energy crisis  in the california department of water resources cdwr entered into contracts to purchase power for sale at cost directly to sce s retail customers and issued bonds to finance those power purchases 
the cdwr s total statewide power charge and bond charge revenue requirements are allocated by the cpuc among the customers of the investor owned utilities 
sce bills and collects from its customers the costs of power purchased and sold by the cdwr  cdwr bond related charges 
table of contents and direct access exit fees 
the cdwr related charges and a portion of direct access exit fees that are remitted directly to the cdwr are not recognized as electric utility revenue by sce and therefore have no impact on sce s earnings  however  they do impact customer rates 
competition because sce is an electric utility company operating within a defined service territory pursuant to authority from the cpuc  sce faces competition only to the extent that federal and california laws permit other entities to provide electricity and related services to customers within sce s service territory 
while california law provides only limited opportunities for customers to choose to purchase power directly from an energy service provider other than sce  a california law was adopted in that permits a limited  phased in expansion of customer choice direct access for nonresidential customers 
sce also faces some competition from cities and municipal districts that create municipal utilities or community choice aggregators 
in addition  customers may install their own on site power generation facilities 
competition with sce is conducted mainly on the basis of price  as customers seek the lowest cost power available 
the effect of competition on sce generally is to reduce the number of customers purchasing power from sce  but those customers typically continue to utilize and pay for sce s transmission and distribution services 
in the area of transmission infrastructure  sce may experience increased competition from merchant transmission providers 
purchased power and fuel supply sce obtains the power needed to serve its customers from its generating facilities and from purchases from qualifying facilities qfs  independent power producers  renewable power producers  the caiso  and other utilities 
in addition  power is provided to sce s customers through purchases by the cdwr under contracts with third parties 
sources of power to serve sce s customers during were approximately purchased power  cdwr  and sce owned generation 
natural gas supply sce requires natural gas to meet contractual obligations for power tolling agreements power contracts in which sce has agreed to provide the natural gas needed for generation under those power contracts and to serve demand for gas at mountainview and sce s peaker plants  which are supplemental plants that only operate when demand for power is high 
all of the physical gas purchased by sce in was purchased through competitive bidding 

table of contents nuclear fuel supply for san onofre units and  contractual arrangements are in place covering of the projected nuclear fuel requirements through the years indicated below uranium concentrates conversion enrichment fabrication for palo verde  contractual arrangements are in place covering of the projected nuclear fuel requirements through the years indicated below uranium concentrates conversion enrichment fabrication spent nuclear fuel information about spent nuclear fuel appears in item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies 
coal supply on january   sce and the other four corners participants entered into a restated and amended four corners fuel agreement with the bhp navajo coal company  under which coal will be supplied to four corners units and until july  the restated and amended agreement contains an option to extend for not less than five additional years or more than years 
caiso wholesale energy market in california and other states  wholesale energy markets exist through which competing electricity generators offer their electricity output to electricity retailers 
each state s wholesale electricity market is generally operated by its state iso or a regional rto 
california s wholesale electricity market is operated by the caiso 
in  the caiso began its market redesign and technology upgrade mrtu program to redesign and upgrade the wholesale energy market across its controlled grid 
the mrtu market design allows the caiso to schedule power in hourly increments with hourly prices through a real time and day ahead market that combines energy  ancillary services  unit commitment and congestion management 
these mrtu features became effective in march and sce began participating in the day ahead and real time markets for the sale of its generation and purchases of its load requirements 
the mrtu structure uses a nodal locational pricing model  which sets wholesale electricity prices at  different system points nodes that reflect local generation and delivery costs  as opposed to the previous system of three broad zonal prices 
generally  sce schedules its 
table of contents electricity generation to serve its load but when it has excess generation or the market price of power is more economic than its own generation  sce may sell power from utility owned generation assets and existing power procurement contracts on  or buy generation and or ancillary services to meet its load requirements from  the day ahead market 
sce will offer to buy its generation at nodes near the source of the generation  but will take delivery at nodes throughout sce s service territory 
congestion may occur when available energy cannot be delivered to all loads due to transmission constraints  which results in transmission congestion charges and differences in prices at various nodes 
the caiso also offers congestion revenue rights or crrs  a commodity that entitles the holder to receive or pay the value of transmission congestion between specific nodes  acting as an economic hedge against transmission congestion charges 
properties sce supplies electricity to its customers through extensive transmission and distribution networks 
its transmission facilities  which are located primarily in california but also in nevada and arizona  deliver power from generating sources to the distribution network and consist of kv  kv  kv  kv  kv  kv and kv lines  and substations 
sce s distribution system  which takes power from substations to customers  includes over  circuit miles of overhead lines   circuit miles of underground lines  million poles  over distribution substations  approximately  transformers  and  area lights and streetlights  all of which are located in california

certain of the documents evidencing such rights obligate sce  under specified circumstances and at its expense  to relocate such transmission  distribution  and communication facilities located on lands owned or controlled by federal  state  or local governments 
thirty one of sce s hydroelectric plants and related reservoirs  are located in whole or in part on us owned lands pursuant to to year ferc licenses that expire at various times between and such licenses impose numerous restrictions and obligations on sce  including the right of the united states to acquire projects upon payment of specified compensation 
when existing licenses expire  the ferc has the authority to issue new licenses to third parties that have filed competing license applications  but only if their license 
table of contents application is superior to sce s and then only upon payment of specified compensation to sce 
new licenses issued to sce are expected to contain more restrictions and obligations than the expired licenses because laws enacted since the existing licenses were issued require the ferc to give environmental objectives greater consideration in the licensing process 
substantially all of sce s properties are subject to the lien of a trust indenture securing first and refunding mortgage bonds  of which approximately billion in principal amount was outstanding on february  sce s rights in four corners  which is located on land of the navajo nation under an easement from the united states and a lease from the navajo nation  may be subject to possible defects 
these defects include possible conflicting grants or encumbrances not ascertainable because of the absence of  or inadequacies in  the applicable recording law and record systems of the bureau of indian affairs and the navajo nation  the possible inability of sce to resort to legal process to enforce its rights against the navajo nation without congressional consent  the possible impairment or termination under certain circumstances of the easement and lease by the navajo nation  congress  or the secretary of the interior  and the possible invalidity of the trust indenture lien against sce s interest in the easement  lease  and improvements on four corners 
insurance sce has property and casualty insurance policies  which include excess liability insurance covering liabilities to third parties for bodily injury or property damage resulting from operations 
severe wildfires in california have given rise to large damage claims against california utilities 
additionally  california law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that imposes strict liability including liability for a claimant s attorneys fees for fire damage caused to private property by a utility s electric facilities that serve the public 
these damage claims and the related doctrine may affect sce s liability insurance levels and cost 
on september   sce renewed its insurance coverage  which included coverage for wildfire liabilities up to a reduced limit of million with an increased self insured retention of million per wildfire occurrence 
various coverage limitations within the policies that make up the insurance coverage could result in substantially higher self insured costs in the event of multiple wildfire occurrences during the policy period september  to august  
sce may experience further coverage reductions and or increased insurance costs in future years 
no assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of sce s insurance coverage

federal energy regulation federal power act the federal power act fpa grants the ferc exclusive jurisdiction over the rates  terms and conditions of wholesale sales of electricity and transmission services in interstate commerce other than transmission that is bundled with retail sales  including ongoing  as well as initial  rate jurisdiction 
this jurisdiction allows the ferc to revoke or modify previously approved rates after notice and opportunity for hearing 
these rates may be based on a cost of service approach or  in geographic and product markets determined by the ferc to be workably competitive  may be market based 
the fpa also grants the ferc jurisdiction over the sale or transfer of specified assets  including wholesale power sales contracts and generation facilities  and in some cases  jurisdiction over the issuance of securities or the assumption of specified liabilities and some interlocking directorates 
dispositions of eme s jurisdictional assets or certain types of financing arrangements may require ferc approval 
deregulation of the electric generating sector began with the enactment of purpa  which established a regulatory scheme for certain qualifying facilities 
most qualifying facilities  as that term is defined in purpa  are exempt from the ratemaking and several other provisions of the fpa 
it was further expanded with the passage of the energy policy act of  which established a regulatory scheme for ewgs and foreign utility companies 
ewgs are subject to the fpa and to the ferc s ratemaking jurisdiction thereunder  but the ferc typically grants ewgs the authority to sell power at market based rates to purchasers which are not affiliated electric utility companies as long as the absence of market power is shown 
more recently  in epact  the us congress recognized that a significant market for electric power generated by independent power producers  such as eme  has developed in the united states and indicated that competitive wholesale electricity markets have become accepted as a fundamental aspect of the electricity industry 
each of eme s us generating facilities has either been determined by the ferc to qualify as a qualifying facility  or the subsidiary owning the facility has been determined to be an ewg 
in addition  eme s power marketing subsidiaries  including emmt  have been authorized by the ferc to make wholesale market sales of power at market based rates and are subject to the ferc ratemaking regulation under the fpa 
public utility regulatory policies act of purpa provides two primary benefits to qualifying facilities 
first  all cogeneration facilities that are qualifying facilities are exempt from certain provisions of the fpa and regulations of the ferc thereunder 
second  the ferc regulations promulgated under purpa initially required electric utilities to purchase electricity generated by qualifying facilities at a price based on the purchasing utility s avoided cost and to sell back up power to the qualifying 
table of contents facility on a nondiscriminatory basis 
epact provides for the elimination of a utility s obligation to purchase power from qualifying facilities at its avoided cost if the ferc determines that the relevant market meets certain conditions for competitive  nondiscriminatory access 
the ferc s regulations also permit qualifying facilities and utilities to negotiate agreements for utility purchases of power at prices different from the utility s avoided costs  but do not require utilities to purchase power at such prices 
several of eme s projects  including the big projects  are qualifying cogeneration facilities 
qualifying cogeneration facilities must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facility s total energy output  and must meet certain efficiency standards 
if one of the projects in which eme has an interest were to lose its qualifying facility status  the project would no longer be entitled to the qualifying facility related exemptions from regulation and could become subject to rate regulation by the ferc under the fpa and additional state regulation 
loss of qualifying facility status could also trigger defaults under covenants to maintain qualifying facility status in the project s power sales agreements  steam sales agreements and financing agreements and result in refund claims from utility customers  termination  penalties or acceleration of indebtedness under such agreements 
eme endeavors to monitor regulatory compliance by its qualifying facility projects in a manner that minimizes the risks of losing these projects qualifying facility status 
transmission of wholesale power generally  projects that sell power to wholesale purchasers other than the local utility to which the project is interconnected require the transmission of electricity over power lines owned by others 
the prices and other terms and conditions of transmission contracts are regulated by the ferc when the entity providing the transmission service is subject to ferc jurisdiction pursuant to the fpa 
the energy policy act of laid the groundwork for a competitive wholesale market for electricity by  among other things  expanding the ferc s authority to order electric utilities to transmit third party electricity over their transmission lines  thus allowing qualifying facilities  power marketers and ewgs to more effectively compete in the wholesale market 
state energy regulation illinois power procurement the illinois power agency act regulates the procurement of power by commonwealth edison and the ameren illinois utilities for their bundled rate customers 
in june  the newly created illinois power agency became responsible for the administration  planning and procurement of power for commonwealth edison and the ameren illinois utilities bundled rate customers using a portfolio managed approach that is to include competitively procured standard wholesale products and renewable energy resources 
the illinois commerce commission  which continues in its role of oversight and approval of the power planning and procurement for utilities bundled retail customers  approved in january  a procurement plan for that was proposed by the illinois power agency 
the plan  which was based on five year demand forecasts  uses a laddered procurement strategy for the period 
in  the illinois power agency acquired through a 
table of contents single request for proposals roughly one third of the forecasted demand for bundled load for commonwealth edison and the ameren illinois utilities 
renewable requirements  in the first year  were purchased by way of one year renewable energy credits  longer contracts may be included in future procurements if required by law or if approved by the illinois commerce commission 
in december  the illinois power agency s procurement plan for supply for the utilities bundled customers for the period was approved by the illinois commerce commission 
markets for generation the united states electric industry  including companies engaged in providing generation  transmission  distribution and retail sales and service of electric power  has undergone significant deregulation over the last three decades  which has led to increased competition  especially in the generation sector 
see further discussion of regulations under regulation of eme united states federal energy regulation 
in areas where isos and rtos have been formed  market participants have open access to transmission service typically at a system wide rate 
isos and rtos may also operate real time and day ahead energy and ancillary service markets  which are governed by ferc approved tariffs and market rules 
the development of such organized markets into which independent power producers are able to sell has reduced their dependence on bilateral contracts with electric utilities 
in various regional wholesale power markets  market administrators and independent market monitors have acknowledged that generators historically have not been provided adequate compensation in the energy markets to avoid the retirement of existing generation or provide adequate financial incentives to attract new investment when needed to ensure system reliability 
as a result  capacity markets have emerged to provide additional financial incentives for electric capacity by compensating supply resources for the capability to supply electricity when needed  and demand resources  for electricity they avoid using 
capacity markets are expected to provide additional revenues for independent power producers 
wholesale markets eme s largest power plants are its fossil fuel power plants located in illinois  which are collectively referred to as the midwest generation plants  and the homer city electric generating station located in pennsylvania  which is referred to as the homer city facilities 
collectively  both the midwest generation plants and homer city facilities are referred to as the fossil fueled facilities in this annual report 
the fossil fueled facilities are merchant generating stations that sell power primarily into pjm  an rto which includes all or parts of delaware  illinois  indiana  kentucky  maryland  michigan  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
pjm operates a wholesale spot energy market and determines the market clearing price for each hour based on bids submitted by participating generators indicating the minimum prices at which a bidder is willing to dispatch energy at various incremental generation levels 
pjm conducts both day ahead and real time energy markets 
pjm s energy markets are based on locational marginal pricing  which establishes hourly prices at specific locations throughout 
table of contents pjm by considering a number of factors  including generator bids  load requirements  transmission congestion and transmission losses 
it can also be affected by  among other things  price caps and other market rules intended to facilitate competition and discourage the exercise of market power 
pjm requires all load serving entities to maintain prescribed levels of capacity  including a reserve margin  to ensure system reliability 
pjm also determines the amount of capacity available from each generator and operates capacity markets 
pjm s capacity markets have a single market clearing price 
in june  pjm implemented the reliability pricing model rpm for capacity  under which capacity commitments are made in advance to provide a long term pricing signal for capacity resources 
the rpm is intended to provide a mechanism for pjm to meet the region s need for generation capacity  while allocating the cost to load serving entities through a locational reliability charge 
pjm also implemented marginal losses for transmission for its competitive wholesale electric market 
load serving entities and generators  such as eme s subsidiaries  midwest generation with respect to the midwest generation plants and homer city with respect to the homer city facilities  may participate in pjm s capacity markets or transact capacity sales on a bilateral basis 
sales may also be made from pjm into the midwest iso miso rto  which includes all or parts of illinois  wisconsin  indiana  michigan  ohio  and other states in the region  and into the new york iso nyiso  which controls the transmission grid and energy and capacity markets for new york state 
two of eme s wind projects sell electricity into rtos as merchant generators 
the lookout wind project sells power into the pjm market  and the goat wind wind project sells power into the electric reliability council of texas market 
the rest of eme s wind power generation facilities currently sell capacity  energy and or ancillary services pursuant to bilateral contracts with electric utilities  regional cooperatives and public power authorities 
competition eme is subject to intense competition from energy marketers  investor owned utilities  government owned power agencies  industrial companies  financial institutions  and other independent power producers 
some of eme s competitors have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and  in the case of utilities  are often able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms  allowing them to build  buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments 
these companies may also have competitive advantages as a result of their scale  the location of their generation facilities  and their contractual arrangements with affiliated entities 
environmental regulations  particularly those that impose stringent state specific emission limits  could put eme s coal fired plants at a disadvantage compared with competing power plants operating in nearby states and subject only to federal emission limits 
potential future climate change regulations could also put eme s coal fired plants at a disadvantage compared to both power plants utilizing other fuels and utilities that may be able to recover climate change compliance costs through rate mechanisms 
in addition  the ability of eme s fossil fuel fired plants to compete may be affected by governmental and regulatory activities

marketing and trading activities eme s power marketing and trading subsidiary  emmt  markets the energy and capacity of eme s merchant generating fleet and  in addition  trades electric power and related commodity and financial products  including forwards  futures  options and swaps 
emmt segregates its marketing and trading activities into two categories marketing emmt engages in the sale of energy and capacity and the purchase of fuels  including coal  natural gas and fuel oil  through intercompany contracts with eme s subsidiaries that own or lease the fossil fueled facilities and eme s merchant wind energy facilities 
eme uses derivatives to reduce its exposure to market risks that arise from fluctuations in the prices of electricity  capacity  fuel  emission allowances  and transmission rights 
the objective of these activities is to sell the output of the power plants on a forward basis or to hedge the risk of future changes in prices  thereby increasing the predictability of earnings and cash flows 
hedging activities include on peak and off peak periods and may include load service requirements contracts with local utilities 
transactions entered into related to hedging activities are designated separately from emmt s trading activities and are recorded in what emmt calls its hedge book 
not all contracts entered into by emmt for hedging purposes qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
trading as an extension of its marketing and hedging activities  emmt seeks to generate trading profits from volatility in the price of electricity  capacity  fuels  and transmission congestion by buying and selling contracts in wholesale markets under limitations approved by eme s risk management committee

environmental regulation of edison international and subsidiaries because edison international does not own or operate any assets  other than the stock of its subsidiaries  it does not have any direct environmental obligations or liabilities 
however  legislative and regulatory activities by federal  state  and local authorities in the united states relating to energy and the environment impose numerous restrictions on the operation of existing facilities and affect the timing  cost  location  design  construction  and operation of new facilities by edison international s subsidiaries  as well as the cost of mitigating the environmental impacts of past operations 
many of these laws  regulations and other activities affect both sce and eme s subsidiaries  although not always to the same extent 
the environmental regulations and other developments discussed below have the largest impact on fossil fuel fired power plants  and therefore the discussion in this section focuses on regulations applicable to the states of california  new mexico  illinois  and pennsylvania  where such facilities are located

table of contents climate change there have been a number of efforts at both the federal and state legislative and regulatory levels to adopt or enact regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
any climate change regulation or other legal obligation that would require substantial reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases or that would impose additional costs or charges for the emission of greenhouse gases could significantly increase the cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels  especially coal  as well as the cost of purchased power  which could adversely affect edison international s business 
federal legislative regulatory developments in june  the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act 
the bill  which was endorsed by edison international  would establish a cap and trade system for greenhouse gas emissions commencing in under the cap and trade system  a cap to reduce aggregate greenhouse gas emissions from all covered entities would be established and decline over time 
emitters of greenhouse gases would be required to have allowances for greenhouse gas emissions during a relevant measurement period 
the bill would provide for stated portions of required allowances to be allocated free of charge in declining amounts over time 
emitters of greenhouse gases would have to purchase the remainder of their required allowances in the open market  although a portion may be provided by so called offset credits for alternative greenhouse gas reduction efforts 
similar legislation was introduced in the us senate in september edison international cannot predict whether legislation imposing limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the us will be passed in  and the timing  content and potential effects on edison international of any legislation that may be enacted remain uncertain 
even if congress does not pass legislation mandating greenhouse gas emissions reductions  regulatory developments under the clean air act caa may also result in greenhouse gas emissions requirements that could affect edison international s subsidiaries 
in april  the us supreme court held  in massachusetts  et al 
v 
environmental protection agency  that greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the caa and that that the us epa has a duty to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to climate change or offer a reasoned explanation for its failure to make such a determination 
in response to this decision  in december  the us epa issued a finding that certain greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  endanger the public health and welfare  which enables the us epa to establish greenhouse gas emissions limits for new light duty vehicles 
it is expected that the us epa will issue the final light duty vehicle emissions limits in march the december endangerment finding will trigger future regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gases  such as power plants  which the us epa plans to phase in beginning in in addition  when the regulation of greenhouse gases from light duty vehicles is finalized  greenhouse gas emissions will become subject to review under the caa s prevention of significant deterioration psd construction or modification of major sources permit program 
sources subject to a psd review for greenhouse gases would be required to use best available control technology bact to control greenhouse gas emissions 
because carbon 
table of contents dioxide is emitted in greater quantities than other caa regulated pollutants  regulating it under the psd program would cover a large number of sources 
to avoid the regulatory and enforcement consequences of such an outcome  in november the us epa proposed a regulation  known as the greenhouse gas tailoring rule 
the greenhouse gas tailoring rule would redefine the psd program to increase the threshold emission limit of carbon dioxide equivalents in a year from tons to  metric tons 
whether or not this regulation is finalized  it is likely that eme s and sce s fossil fueled generating facilities would be major sources for purposes of the psd programs 
however  because the current psd proposal affects only new or modified sources  it is not expected to have an immediate effect on eme s or sce s existing generating plants 
if eme or sce are required to install pollution controls in the future or otherwise modify their operations in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions  the impact will depend on the nature and timing of the controls to be applied  both of which remain uncertain 
edison international does not believe that currently there are commercially and technically feasible  full scale methods to control greenhouse gas emissions from its subsidiaries existing fossil fueled generating facilities 
state legislative regulatory developments california has enacted two laws regarding greenhouse gas emissions 
the first law  the california global warming solutions act of also referred to as ab  establishes a comprehensive program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
ab requires the california air resources board carb to develop regulations  potentially including market based compliance mechanisms  targeted to reduce california s greenhouse gas emissions to levels by the carb s mandatory program will commence in and will implement incremental reductions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to levels by the carb has released preliminary draft regulations establishing a california cap and trade program  which include revisions to the carb s mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting regulation and are expected to be finalized by the carb in october the second law  sb  required the cpuc and the california energy commission cec to adopt greenhouse gas emission performance standards that restrict the ability of investor owned and publicly owned utilities  respectively  to enter into long term arrangements for the purchase of electricity 
the standards must equal the performance of a combined cycle gas turbine generator 
the standards that have been adopted prohibit california load serving entities  including sce  from entering into long term financial commitments with generators that emit more than  pounds of co per mwh  which includes most coal fired plants 
utility purchases of power generated by eme s facilities in california are subject to the emissions performance standards established in sb at this time  eme believes that all of its facilities in california meet the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard adopted under sb  but eme will continue to monitor the regulations  as they are developed  for potential impact on its existing facilities and its projects under development 
sb also affects the ability of utilities to make long term capital investments in generators that do not meet the emission performance standards 
sb may prohibit sce from making emission control expenditures at four corners 

table of contents california law also requires sce to increase its procurement of electricity generated from renewable resources by at least of its annual retail electricity sales per year so that of its annual electricity sales are procured from such resources by no later than december  or such later date as flexible compliance requirements permit 
in addition  in september  governor schwarzenegger issued an executive order directing the carb to adopt a regulation consistent with of retail sellers annual electricity sales being obtained from renewable energy sources by the executive order provides that the regulation may accelerate or expand the timeframe for compliance as well as increase the targeted percentage of annual electricity sales to be obtained from renewable resources  based on a thorough assessment of relevant factors 
regional initiatives there are a number of regional initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions 
implementing regulations for such regional initiatives are likely to vary from state to state and may be more stringent and costly than federal legislative proposals currently being debated in congress 
it cannot yet be determined whether or to what extent any federal legislation would preempt regional or state initiatives  because these initiatives are in varying stages of development and implementation 
if state and or regional initiatives remain in effect after federal legislation is enacted  generators could be required to satisfy them in addition to federal standards 
seven northeastern states have entered into a memorandum of understanding to establish a regional cap and trade greenhouse gas program for electric generators  referred to as the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi 
the rggi states now numbering have passed laws and or regulations to implement the rggi program 
illinois and pennsylvania are not signatories to the rggi  although pennsylvania participated in the process as an observer 
illinois is a party to the midwestern greenhouse gas reduction accord  by which six midwestern states and the canadian province of manitoba agreed to develop regional greenhouse gas emission reduction goals within one year using a multi sector cap and trade program to be implemented within months 
in june  the midwestern greenhouse gas reduction accord advisory group released its recommendations for emissions reduction targets and the design of a regional cap and trade program 
the group is also drafting a framework for the cap and trade program that will serve as a basis for individual state legislative or regulatory action to implement the program 
arizona  california  montana  new mexico  oregon  utah  washington  and the canadian provinces of british columbia  manitoba  ontario and quebec have launched the western climate initiative to develop strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the region to below levels by in september  the initiative partners released recommendations for a regional cap and trade program to help achieve that reduction goal 
in february  arizona gave notice that it would not take part in the western climate initiative s cap and trade program 

table of contents litigation developments in  three courts issued decisions in cases involving the question of whether power plants and other large sources could constitute public nuisances  making the sources potentially liable for damages or other remedies 
in october  a california federal district court dismissed the complaint that had been filed by the native alaskan village of kivalina and the kivalina tribe in february against defendants  including edison international  who directly or indirectly engaged in the electric generating  oil and gas  or coal mining lines of business 
plaintiffs had alleged greenhouse gas emissions from the defendants business activities contributed to global warming impacts that are melting the arctic sea ice that protects the village from winter storms and that the village would soon need to be abandoned or relocated at a cost of between million and million 
the court dismissed the plaintiffs federal nuisance claims stating that they were inappropriate for judicial resolution because they required policy choices that were reserved to the legislative or executive branches of the government the political question doctrine 
the court also held that the plaintiffs did not have standing under federal law to bring the case  in part because of the lack of connection between the defendants conduct and the harm that plaintiffs alleged was occurring 
the court also dismissed plaintiffs state law nuisance claims  but without prejudice to those claims being re filed in state court 
the plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal order to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
in contrast to the district court decision in kivalina  the us court of appeals for the second circuit  in september  and the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit  in october  reversed and remanded lower court decisions that had dismissed complaints filed in new york and mississippi  respectively  against electric utilities and others  for injunctive relief and or damages allegedly arising as a result of greenhouse gas emissions 
these courts held that plaintiffs had standing and that their claims sounding in various common law theories  including public nuisance in the new york case and public nuisance  private nuisance  trespass and negligence in the mississippi case were not barred by the political question doctrine 
neither edison international nor its subsidiaries was named as a defendant in the new york case 
at the time the action was dismissed by the court in mississippi  the plaintiffs were seeking to amend their complaint to include edison international and several affiliates of edison international  including eme and sce  as defendants 
each of these differing rulings remains subject to appeal  rehearing  or potential review by the us supreme court  and thus the ultimate impact of these cases remains uncertain 
in addition  edison international cannot predict whether the appellate decisions will result in the filing of new actions with similar claims or whether congress  in considering climate legislation  will address directly the availability of courts for these sorts of claims 

table of contents emissions data reporting sce s independently certified greenhouse gas emission data for  as reported to the california climate action registry  showed that sce emitted approximately million metric tons from sce owned generation 
sce s reported emissions are pro rated to its ownership interests in the emitting facilities 
eme s greenhouse gas emissions were approximately million metric tons  although they were not independently verified 
beginning with data  sce will be reporting to tcr as described below and to the carb 
edison international and its subsidiaries will begin reporting data to the us epa in sce reported greenhouse gas emission data to the carb in june the carb reporting is done in three parts greenhouse gas emissions from sce owned generation  sulfur hexafluoride sf emissions from sce owned or operated equipment  and transaction reporting of mwhs purchased and resource types from which the carb calculates total greenhouse gas emissions 
the carb has not yet published its calculations on sce s data 
edison international became a founding reporter to the climate registry tcr  formed in may tcr is a multi national organization  which allows organizations to voluntarily inventory  verify  and publicly report their greenhouse gas emissions 
edison international filed initial emissions data for in september with tcr 
this information did not cover all of edison international s owned generation  as allowed under the tcr transitional reporter rules that apply for the first two years that an entity reports its emissions with tcr 
verified emissions data for edison international is expected to be released publicly by tcr at the end of the second quarter of in september  the us epa issued its final mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule  which requires all energy sources within specified categories  including electric generation facilities  to begin monitoring greenhouse gas emissions in january  and to submit annual reports to the us epa by march of each year  with the first report due on march  responses to energy demands and future greenhouse gas emission constraints irrespective of the outcome of current federal or state legislative deliberations  edison international believes that regulation of greenhouse gas emissions is likely to develop through increased costs  mandatory emission limits or other mechanisms  and that demand for energy from renewable sources will also continue to increase 
as a result  sce is creating a generation profile from wind  solar  geothermal  biomass and small hydro plants  that will be adaptable to a variety of regulatory and energy use environments 
its renewables portfolio of owned and procured sources currently consists of  mw from wind  mw from geothermal  mw from solar  mw from biomass  and mw from small hydro 
eme is developing several renewables projects and is the seventh largest wind power generator in the united states 
sce has developed and promoted several energy efficiency and demand response initiatives in the residential market  including an ongoing meter replacement program to help reduce peak energy demand  a rebate program to encourage customers to invest in more efficient appliances  subsidies for purchases of energy efficient lighting products  appliance recycling 
table of contents programs  widely publicized tips to customers for saving energy  and a voluntary demand response program which offers customers financial incentives to reduce their electricity use 
sce is also replacing its electro mechanical grid control systems with computerized devices that allow more effective grid management 
corporate governance processes the boards of directors of edison international and sce regularly receive reports from senior management regarding environmental issues that affect the companies  including climate change issues 
air quality the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation s air quality by regulating certain air emissions from mobile and stationary sources 
the states implement and administer many of these programs and may impose additional or more stringent requirements under the caa scheme 
the federal caa  state clean air acts  and federal and state regulations implementing such statutes apply to plants owned by eme and sce  as well as to plants from which sce purchases power  but have their largest impact on the operation of coal fired plants 
the federal environmental regulations require states to adopt state implementation plans for certain pollutants  known as sips  which are equal to or more stringent than the federal requirements 
these plans detail how the state will attain the standards that are mandated by the relevant law or regulation 
the caa requires the us epa to review the available scientific data for six criteria pollutants and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect public health and welfare 
these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards  or naaqs 
the six criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide  lead  nitrogen dioxide  ozone  particulate matter  and sulfur dioxide 
each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not non attainment areas  and must develop a sip both to bring non attainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and to maintain good air quality in attainment areas 
all sips are submitted to the us epa for approval 
if a state fails to develop adequate plans  the us epa will develop and implement a plan 
the attainment status of areas can change  and states may be required to develop new sips that address these changes 
many of eme s facilities are located in counties that have not attained naaqs for ozone and fine particulate matter 
nox emissions from power plants impact ambient air ozone levels and so emissions from power plants impact ambient air fine particulate matter levels 
as described further below  on december   midwest generation entered into an agreement with the illinois epa to reduce mercury  noxand nox emissions at the midwest generation plants 
the agreement requires midwest generation to achieve air emission reductions for nox and nox  and those reductions should contribute to or effect compliance with various existing us epa ambient air quality standards 
it is possible that if lower ozone  particulate matter  nox or nox naaqs are finalized by us epa in the future  illinois may implement regulations that are more stringent than those required by midwest generation s existing agreement with illinois epa 

table of contents nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide clean air interstate rule the cair  issued by the us epa on march   was intended to address ozone and fine particulate matter attainment issues by reducing regional nox and nox emissions 
the cair had mandated significant reductions in nox and nox emission allowance caps under the caa in the eastern states and the district of columbia where compliance with the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter was at issue 
there is substantial uncertainty as to how the us epa will address the deficiencies identified in decisions by the us court of appeals for the us circuit that resulted in the remand of the cair to the us epa for the issuance of a revised rule 
the cair will remain in effect until the us epa issues a revised rule  which is currently expected to be proposed in as a result of the dc circuit court s decisions  it is unclear whether the us epa will be able to design a cap and trade program for nox and so that is consistent with the caa 
it is also unclear whether existing sips in certain states  particularly illinois and pennsylvania  will be sufficient to comply with the caa 
the fossil fueled facilities may be subject to additional requirements  which could result in increased capital expenditures and operating expenses to comply with a revised cair or alternative regulations under the caa 
in the case of the midwest generation plants  these new requirements could exceed those applicable under the cps 
proposed naaqs for sulfur dioxide in november  the us epa proposed a new one hour naaqs for so the new standard is proposed to be between and parts per billion 
the us epa is required by a consent decree to take final action by june  the proposed rule would require states to submit sips in  with compliance by illinois on december   midwest generation entered into an agreement with the illinois epa to reduce mercury  nox and nox emissions at the midwest generation plants 
the agreement has been embodied in an illinois rule called the cps 
all of midwest generation s illinois coal fired electric generating units are subject to the cps 
the principal emission standards and control technology requirements for nox and nox under the cps are as described below nox emissions beginning in calendar year and continuing in each calendar year thereafter  midwest generation must comply with an annual and seasonal nox emission rate of no more than lbs million btu 
in addition to these standards  midwest generation must install and operate sncr equipment on units and at the crawford station by december  so emissions midwest generation must comply with an overall so annual emission rate beginning with lbs million btu in and decreasing annually until it reaches lbs million btu in and thereafter 

table of contents midwest generation has not decided upon a particular combination of retrofits to meet the required step down in emission rates and continues to review alternatives  including interim compliance solutions 
the cps also specifies that specific control technologies are to be installed on some units by specified dates 
in these cases  midwest generation must either install the required technology by the specified deadline or shut down the unit 
the cps also requires midwest generation to shut down units and at the will county station by december  during  midwest generation also conducted tests of nox removal technology based on sncr that may be employed to meet cps requirements 
based on this testing  midwest generation has concluded that installation of sncr technology on multiple units will meet the nox portion of the cps 
capital expenditures for installation of sncr equipment are expected to be approximately million in and approximately million in testing of fgd technology based on dry sodium sorbent injection demonstrated significant reductions in so when using the low sulfur coal employed by midwest generation  however  further analysis and evaluation are required to determine the appropriate method to comply with the so portion of the cps 
use of fgd technology based on injection of dry sodium sorbent in combination with midwest generation s use of low sulfur coal is expected to require substantially less capital and installation time than dry scrubber technology  but would likely result in higher ongoing operating costs than dry scrubber technology and may consequently result in lower dispatch rates and reduced competitiveness 
midwest generation may also combine the use of dry sorbent injection technology with upgrades to its particulate removal systems to meet environmental regulations 
midwest generation cannot predict what specific method of so removal will be used or the total costs that will be incurred to comply with the cps 
a decision whether or not to proceed with the above or other approaches to compliance remains subject to further analysis and evaluation of several factors  such as market conditions  regulatory and legislative developments  and forecasted capital and operating costs 
midwest generation could elect to shut down units when required in order to comply with the so removal requirements of the cps 
due to existing uncertainties about the factors noted above  midwest generation may defer final decisions about particular units as long as possible 
accordingly  final decisions on whether to install controls  the particular controls that will be installed and the resulting capital commitments may not occur for up to two years for some of the units and potentially later for others 
midwest generation continues to evaluate various scenarios and cannot predict the extent of shut downs and retrofits or the particular combination of retrofits and shut downs it may ultimately employ to comply with the cps 
pennsylvania the homer city facilities were subject to cair during and complied with both the nox and nox requirements using existing equipment and purchasing of so allowances 
pennsylvania adopted a state version of cair  which the us epa approved in december homer city expects to comply with the pennsylvania cair  which is substantially similar to the federal cair  in the same manner in which it complies with the federal cair 

table of contents mercury clean air mercury rule until new federal standards are developed to replace the camr  eme will not be able to determine whether it will be necessary to undertake mercury emission control measures beyond those required by state regulations 
the camr was established by the us epa as an attempt to reduce mercury emissions from existing coal fired power plants using a cap and trade program 
eme s and sce s coal fired electric generating facilities sce currently has a ownership interest in units and at four corners emit mercury and other regulated emissions 
as a result of the decision by the us court of appeals for the us circuit in february that rejected both the camr and the related decision by the us epa to remove oil and coal fired plants from the list of sources to be regulated under section of the caa until camr is replaced by a new mercury rule  mercury regulation will come from state regulatory bodies 
as described below  eme s coal fired electric generating facilities are already subject to significant unit specific mercury emission reduction requirements under illinois and pennsylvania law although  as noted below  pennsylvania s mercury regulations have been invalidated 
illinois midwest generation s compliance with the cps supersedes the illinois mercury regulations that would otherwise be applicable to the midwest generation plants 
the cps requires that  beginning in calendar year  and continuing thereafter on a rolling month basis  midwest generation must either achieve an emission standard of 
lbs mercury gwh gross electrical output or a minimum reduction in mercury for each unit except unit at the will county station  which shall be included in calendar year 
in addition to these standards  midwest generation was required to install and operate carbon injection equipment on all operating units 
installation of the equipment was completed in capital expenditures relating to these controls were million 
midwest generation will also be required to install cold side electrostatic precipitator or baghouse equipment on unit at the waukegan station by december   and on unit at the will county station by december  pennsylvania until new legislation is passed authorizing the adoption of revised mercury regulations  the homer facilities will not be required to comply with pennsylvania mercury limitations 
the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep attempted to implement regulations reducing the mercury emissions at coal fired power plants by by and by  as embodied in the pennsylvania camr sip 
the pennsylvania supreme court upheld a decision by the commonwealth court declaring pennsylvania s mercury rule unlawful  invalid and unenforceable  and enjoining pennsylvania from continued implementation and enforcement of the rule 

table of contents ozone and particulates national ambient air quality standards in september  the us epa issued a final rule that would significantly reduce the hour fine particulate standard from ug m to ug m  but in february  the us court of appeals for the dc circuit remanded the annual fine particulate matter standard to the us epa for further review 
in march  the us epa issued a final rule revising the primary and secondary naaqs for ozone  reducing the level of the hour standard to parts per million ppm 
in january  the us epa proposed revisions that would further lower the hour primary ozone standard to a level in the range of ppm and impose a cumulative  seasonal secondary standard in the range of ppm hours 
final standards are expected in august eme and sce anticipate that any such further emission reduction obligations would not be imposed under this standard until at the earliest 
illinois the illinois sip for hour ozone was submitted to the us epa on march  the sip for fine particulates was to be submitted to the us epa by april   but is currently expected to be submitted in as the fine particulate and ozone standards are finalized  as described above  illinois may be required to implement additional emission control measures to address emissions of nox  nox and volatile organic compounds 
pennsylvania in august  the us epa accepted padep s maintenance plan  which indicated that the existing and upcoming regulations controlling emissions of volatile organic compounds and nox will result in continued compliance with the hour ozone standard 
however  in march  the padep recommended to the us epa that indiana county where the homer city facilities are located be designated non attainment under the us epa s revised hour ozone standard 
until the us epa completes its revision to the hour ozone standard  redesignations are finalized  and additional regulations are developed to achieve attainment with the revised standard  eme will not know what specific requirements it will have to meet 
however  eme expects that its currently installed scrs will be capable of meeting these new requirements 
effective april   the padep changed its air opacity policy  eliminating many exemptions and reducing the allowable exceedance rate to of a unit s operating time 
homer city undertook optimization of unit ramp rates and combustion parameters at the homer city facilities to reduce the deratings required to meet the opacity standards 
additional capital improvements may also be required 
homer city operated below the exceedance rate during the second  third and fourth quarters of with respect to fine particulates  in november  the us epa indicated that indiana county  homer city township is not in compliance with applicable standards 
the padep 
table of contents must now submit an updated sip by november  eme cannot determine the potential effects of the sip at this time 
regional haze the regional haze rules under the caa are designed to prevent impairment of visibility in certain federally designated areas 
the goal of the rules is to restore visibility in mandatory federal class i areas  such as national parks and wilderness areas  to natural background conditions by sources such as power plants that are reasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in class i areas may be required to install best available retrofit technology bart or implement other control strategies to meet regional haze control requirements 
the us epa issued a final rulemaking on regional haze in requiring emission controls that constitute bart for industrial facilities that emit air pollutants which reduce visibility by causing or contributing to regional haze 
these amendments required states to develop implementation plans to comply with bart by december  to identify the facilities that will have to reduce so 
nox and particulate matter emissions  and then to set bart emissions limits for those facilities 
failure to do so results in a federal implementation plan 
illinois and pennsylvania neither illinois nor pennsylvania has submitted a sip that addresses regional haze issues under the caa  and so  beginning on december  both states became subject to a two year deadline after which a federal implementation plan will govern related emission issues 
as a result of this uncertainty and the questions surrounding the cair program  eme cannot predict whether it will be required to install bart or implement other control strategies at the midwest generation plants and or the homer city facilities  what specific measures will be required or how much they will cost 
the cps  discussed above in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide illinois  addresses emissions reductions at bart affected sources 
in pennsylvania  the padep considers the cair to meet the bart requirements  and the homer city facilities are only required to consider reductions in emissions of suspended particulate matter pm  which at this time are being evaluated by the state 
new mexico in relation to four corners  the us epa requested that the arizona public service company aps perform a regional haze bart analysis 
aps submitted the analysis to the us epa  proposing the installation of certain combustion control equipment as bart for four corners 
however  the us epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking that called for post combustion controls in the form of selective catalytic reduction scr pollution control equipment 
a final us epa determination on this matter is expected in late until the final determination is issued  sce cannot predict what pollution control equipment will be required at four corners and thus cannot accurately estimate the expenditures that would be necessary for such equipment 
in any case  due to the investment constraints of sb  the california law on greenhouse gas emission performance standards discussed above in climate change state legislative regulatory developments  sce does not expect to 
table of contents be able to participate in any investment in scr post combustion controls or combustion controls at four corners 
sce thus does not expect to enter into any long term ownership arrangements for its share of four corners units and after the expiration of the current participant agreements due to the investment constraints of sb new source review requirements nsr the nsr regulations impose certain requirements on facilities  such as electric generating stations  if modifications are made to air emissions sources at the facility 
since  the us epa has pursued a coordinated compliance and enforcement strategy to address caa compliance issues at the nation s coal fired power plants 
the strategy has included both the filing of suits against a number of power plant owners  and the issuance of administrative novs to a number of power plant owners alleging nsr violations 
illinois and pennsylvania on august   midwest generation received an nov from the us epa alleging that midwest generation and commonwealth edison violated various provisions of the nsr rules as well as state air regulations at the midwest generation plants 
after attempts at settlement failed  on august   the us epa and the state of illinois filed a complaint in the northern district of illinois against midwest generation  but not commonwealth edison  based in part on the allegations in the nov and alleging that construction projects undertaken prior to midwest generation s ownership violated various provisions of the nsr rules and title v requirements 
on june   homer city received an nov from the us epa  which alleges that certain construction projects  all completed before homer city acquired the homer city facilities  violated various provisions of the nsr rules and title v permit requirements 
see item legal proceedings midwest generation new source review lawsuit and homer city new source review notice of violation for further discussion 
new mexico in april  aps  as operating agent of four corners  received a us epa request pursuant to section of the caa for information about four corners 
the us epa requested information about four corners and its operations  including information about four corners capital projects from to the present 
aps has responded to the us epa request 
sce understands that in other cases the us epa has utilized similar section letters for examining whether power plants have triggered nsr requirements under the caa and are therefore potentially subject to more stringent air pollution control requirements 
no nsr enforcement related proceedings have been initiated by the us epa with respect to four corners 
sce cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry 
water quality clean water act regulations under the federal clean water act require permits for the discharge of pollutants into united states waters and permits for the discharge of storm water from certain facilities 

table of contents the clean water act also regulates the temperature of effluent discharges and the location  design  and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities 
california has a us epa approved program to issue individual or group general permits for the regulation of clean water act discharges 
california also regulates certain discharges not regulated by the us epa 
in january  the us court of appeals for the second circuit rejected the us epa rule on cooling water intake structures and remanded it to the us epa 
among the key provisions remanded by the court were the use of cost benefit analysis for determining the best technology available and the use of restoration to achieve compliance with the rule 
on july  the us epa suspended the requirements for cooling water intake structures  pending further rulemaking 
in april  the us supreme court reversed the second circuit and held that the us epa may consider  but is not required to use  cost benefit analysis in formulating regulations under clean water act section b 
the court did not review the second circuit s rejection of the use of restoration as compliance with section b  which means the second circuit decision on this issue remains valid 
the us epa is currently rewriting the rule  and it is unknown whether revised regulations will use cost benefit analysis 
eme has collected data at its potentially affected midwest generation plants in illinois to begin determining what corrective actions might have been needed under the previous rule 
because there are no defined compliance targets absent a new rule  eme and sce are reviewing a wide range of possible control technologies 
although the new rule could have a material impact on eme and sce  until the final compliance criteria have been published  neither eme nor sce can reasonably determine the financial impact 
illinois in october  the illinois epa filed a proposed rule with the illinois pollution control board pcb that would establish more stringent thermal and effluent water quality standards for the chicago area waterway system and lower des plaines river 
midwest generation s fisk  crawford and will county stations use water from the chicago area waterway system and its joliet station uses water from the lower des plaines river for cooling purposes 
the rule  if implemented  is expected to affect the manner in which those stations use water for station cooling 
the proposed rule is the subject of an administrative proceeding before the illinois pcb and must be approved by the illinois pcb and the illinois joint committee on administrative rules as well as the us epa 
hearings began in january  and are continuing in midwest generation is a party in those proceedings 
it is not possible to predict the timing for resolution of the proceeding  the final form of the rule  or how it would impact the operation of the affected stations  however  significant capital expenditures may be required depending on the form of the final rule 
pennsylvania the discharge from the treatment plant receiving the wastewater stream from eme s unit wet scrubbing system at the homer city facilities has exceeded the stringent water quality based limits for selenium in the station s npdes permit 
homer city and the padep entered 
table of contents into a consent order and agreement related to selenium discharge  effective july   under which homer city paid a civil penalty of  and agreed to install modifications to its wastewater system to achieve consistent compliance with discharge limits 
prohibition on the use of ocean based once through cooling california in june the california state water resources control board issued a draft statewide water quality control policy on the use of coastal and estuarine waters for power plant cooling 
the policy would establish closed cycle wet cooling as the best technology available for retrofitting existing once through cooled plants  such as sce s san onofre  which use ocean water for cooling purposes 
if the draft policy is adopted  it may significantly impact both operations at san onofre and sce s ability to procure timely generating capacity from fossil fuel plants that use ocean water in once through cooling systems 
it may also impact system reliability and the cost of electricity to the extent other coastal power plants in california are forced to shut down or limit operations 
the policy has the potential to adversely affect california s nineteen once through cooled power plants  which provide over  mw of combined  in state generation capacity  including over  mw of capacity interconnected within sce s service territory 
hazardous substances and hazardous waste under various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of any facility may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products located at that facility  and may be held liable for property damage  personal injury  natural resource damages  and investigation and remediation costs incurred by governmental entities and third parties in connection with these releases or threatened releases 
many of these laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  cercla  impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances  and courts have interpreted liability under these laws to be strict and joint and several 
in connection with the ownership and operation of its facilities  edison international may be liable for costs associated with hazardous waste compliance and remediation required by laws and regulations 
through an incentive mechanism  the cpuc allows sce to recover in retail rates paid by its customers some of the environmental remediation costs at certain sites 
additional information about these laws and regulations appears in item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies 
coal combustion wastes us epa regulations currently classify coal combustion wastes as solid wastes that are exempt from hazardous waste requirements 
the exemption applies to fly ash  bottom ash  slag  and flue gas emission control wastes generated from the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels 
the us epa has studied coal combustion wastes extensively and in concluded that fossil fuel combustions wastes do not warrant regulation as a hazardous waste 
the current classification of coal combustion wastes as exempt from hazardous waste requirements enables 
table of contents beneficial uses of coal combustion wastes  such as for cement production and fill materials 
midwest generation currently provides a portion of its coal combustion wastes for beneficial uses 
midwest generation is also examining the impact of current and proposed emission control technologies on ash quality for beneficial use 
the us epa is expected to publish proposed regulations relating to coal combustion waste in additional regulation of the storage  disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion waste could affect the management of such wastes and could require eme and sce to incur additional capital and operating costs  with no assurance that the additional costs could be recovered 
additionally  sce may be prohibited from making such expenditures under sb  the california law on greenhouse gas emission performance standards see climate change state legislative regulatory developments above for a description of sb

risk factors risks relating to edison international edison international s subsidiaries are subject to extensive environmental regulations that may involve significant and increasing costs and adversely affect them 
edison international s subsidiaries are subject to extensive environmental regulation and permitting requirements that involve significant and increasing costs 
sce and emg devote significant resources to environmental monitoring  pollution control equipment and emission allowances to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulatory requirements 
however  the current trend is toward more stringent standards  stricter regulation  and more expansive application of environmental regulations 
the us congress is considering several proposals to regulate greenhouse gas emissions 
the us environmental protection agency us epa has issued a finding that certain greenhouse gases endanger the public health and welfare and are air pollutants that are subject to the clean air act 
in addition  the attorneys general of several states  including california  certain environmental advocacy groups  and numerous state regulatory agencies in the united states have been focusing considerable attention on greenhouse gas emissions from coal fired power plants and their potential role in climate change 
the adoption of laws and regulations to implement greenhouse gas controls could adversely affect operations  particularly of the coal fired plants 
the continued operation of sce and emg facilities  particularly the coal fired facilities  may require substantial capital expenditures for environmental controls 
in addition  future environmental laws and regulations  and future enforcement proceedings by environmental authorities could affect the costs and the manner in which these subsidiaries conduct business 
current and future state laws and regulations in california also could increase the required amount of power that must be procured from renewable resources 
furthermore  changing environmental regulations could make some units uneconomical to maintain or operate 
if the affected subsidiaries cannot comply with all applicable regulations  they could be required to retire or suspend operations at such facilities  or to restrict or modify the operations of these facilities  and their business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents edison international may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds for an extended period to edison international 
edison international is a holding company and  as such  it has no operations of its own 
edison international s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock at the current rate is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to make upstream distributions or to repay funds to edison international 
prior to funding edison international  edison international s subsidiaries have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied  including  among others  debt service and preferred stock dividends 
financial market and economic conditions may have an adverse effect on edison international s subsidiaries 
see risks relating to sce and risks relating to emg below for further discussion 
risks relating to sce regulatory risks sce s financial viability depends upon its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates 
sce is a regulated entity subject to cpuc and ferc jurisdiction in almost all aspects of its business  including the rates  terms and conditions of its services  procurement of electricity for its customers  issuance of securities  dispositions of utility assets and facilities  aspects of project site identification and the operations of its electricity distribution systems 
sce s ongoing financial viability depends on its ability to recover from its customers in a timely manner its costs  including the costs of electricity purchased for its customers  through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the cpuc  and its ability to pass through to its customers in rates its ferc authorized revenue requirements 
sce s financial viability also depends on its ability to recover through the rates it is allowed to charge an adequate return on capital  including long term debt and equity 
if sce is unable to recover material amounts of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital  its financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
sce s energy procurement activities are subject to regulatory and market risks that could adversely affect its financial condition and liquidity 
sce obtains energy  capacity  renewable attributes and ancillary services needed to serve its customers from its own generating plants  as well as through contracts with energy producers and sellers 
california law and cpuc decisions allow sce to recover through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers reasonable procurement costs incurred in compliance with an approved procurement plan 
nonetheless  sce s cash flows remain subject to volatility resulting from its procurement activities 
in addition  sce is subject to the risks of unfavorable or untimely cpuc decisions about the compliance of procurement activities with sce s procurement plan and the reasonableness of certain procurement related costs 
many of sce s power purchase contracts are tied to market prices for natural gas 
some of its contracts also are subject to volatility in market prices for electricity 
sce seeks to hedge 
table of contents its market price exposure to the extent authorized by the cpuc 
sce may not be able to hedge its risk for commodities on favorable terms or fully recover the costs of hedges through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers  which could adversely affect sce s liquidity and results of operation 
in its power purchase contracts and other procurement arrangements  sce is exposed to risks from changes in the credit quality of its counterparties  many of whom may be adversely affected by the conditions in the financial markets 
if a counterparty were to default on its obligations  sce could be exposed to potentially volatile spot markets for buying replacement power or selling excess power and this could have a material adverse effect on sce s liquidity and financial condition if such costs cannot be recovered in a timely manner 
sce is subject to extensive regulation and the risk of adverse regulatory decisions and changes in applicable regulations or legislation 
sce operates in a highly regulated environment 
sce s business is subject to extensive federal  state and local energy  environmental and other laws and regulations 
the cpuc regulates sce s retail operations  and the ferc regulates sce s wholesale operations 
the nuclear regulatory commission regulates sce s nuclear power plants 
the construction  planning  and project site identification of sce s power plants and transmission lines in california are also subject to the jurisdiction of the california energy commission for plants mw or greater  and the cpuc 
the construction  planning and project site identification of transmission lines that are outside of california are subject to the regulation of the relevant state agency 
sce must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders 
should sce be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on sce  sce s business could be adversely affected 
existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to sce or sce s facilities in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on sce s business or result in significant additional costs because of sce s need to comply with those requirements 
operating risks sce s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if it is unable to successfully manage the risks inherent in operating and improving its facilities 
sce owns and operates extensive electricity facilities that are interconnected to the united states western electricity grid 
sce is also undertaking large scale new infrastructure construction  which involves risks related to permitting  governmental approvals  and construction delays 
the operation of sce s facilities and the facilities of third parties on which it relies involves numerous risks  including operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements  
table of contents imposition of operational performance standards by agencies with regulatory oversight of sce s facilities  environmental and personal injury liabilities caused by the operation of sce s facilities  interruptions in fuel supply  blackouts  employee work force factors  including strikes  work stoppages or labor disputes  weather  storms  earthquakes  fires  floods or other natural disasters  acts of terrorism  and explosions  accidents  mechanical breakdowns and other events that affect demand  result in power outages  reduce generating output or cause damage to sce s assets or operations or those of third parties on which it relies 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in lower revenues or increased expenses and liabilities  or both  which may not be fully recovered through insurance  rates or other means in a timely manner or at all 
there are inherent risks associated with operating nuclear power generating facilities 
spent fuel storage capacity could be insufficient to permit long term operation of sce s nuclear plants 
sce operates and is majority owner of san onofre nuclear generating station and is part owner of palo verde nuclear generating station 
the us department of energy has defaulted on its obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear industry participants by january  if sce or the operator of palo verde were unable to arrange and maintain sufficient capacity for interim spent fuel storage now or in the future  it could hinder the operation of the plants and impair the value of sce s ownership interests until storage could be obtained  each of which may have a material adverse effect on sce 
existing insurance and ratemaking arrangements may not protect sce fully against losses from a nuclear incident 
federal law limits public liability claims from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection which is currently approximately billion 
sce and other owners of the san onofre and palo verde nuclear generating stations have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available of million per site 
if this public liability limit is insufficient  federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by congress 
this could include an additional assessment on all licensed reactor operators as a measure for raising further revenue 
if this were to occur  tension could exist between the federal government s attempt to impose revenue raising measures upon sce and the cpuc s willingness to allow sce to pass this liability along to its customers  resulting in under collection of sce s costs 
there can be no assurance of sce s ability to recover uninsured costs in the event federal appropriations are insufficient 

table of contents sce s insurance coverage may not be sufficient under all circumstances and sce may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance 
sce s insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which it may be subject 
a loss for which sce is not fully insured could materially and adversely affect sce s financial condition and results of operations 
further  due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets  insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to sce 
financing risks sce relies on access to the capital markets 
if sce were unable to access capital markets or the cost of capital was to substantially increase  its liquidity and operations could be adversely affected 
sce s ability to fund operations and planned capital expenditure projects  as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest depends on its cash flow and access to the capital markets 
sce s ability to arrange financing and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors  including sce s levels of indebtedness  maintenance of acceptable credit ratings  its financial performance  liquidity and cash flow  and other market conditions 
market conditions which could adversely affect sce s financing costs and availability include current state and liquidity of financial markets  market prices for electricity or gas  changes in interest rates and rates of inflation  terrorist attacks or the threat of terrorist attacks on sce s facilities or unrelated energy companies  and the overall health of the utility industry 
sce may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons 
the failure to obtain additional capital from time to time may have a material adverse effect on sce s liquidity and operations 

table of contents risks relating to emg environmental and regulatory risks eme is subject to extensive environmental regulation and permitting requirements that may involve significant and increasing costs 
eme s operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations with respect to  among other things  air quality  water quality  waste disposal  and noise 
eme is required to obtain  and comply with conditions established by  licenses  permits and other approvals in order to construct  operate or modify its facilities 
failure to comply with these requirements could subject eme to civil or criminal liability  the imposition of liens or fines  or actions by regulatory agencies seeking to curtail operations of eme s projects 
see risks relating to edison international 
the controls imposed on the midwest generation plants as a result of the combined pollutant standard may require material expenditures or unit shutdowns 
midwest generation has entered into an agreement with the illinois epa to reduce mercury  nox and nox emissions at the midwest generation plants 
the agreement has been embodied in an illinois rule called the combined pollutant standard 
all of midwest generation s illinois coal fired electric generating units are subject to the combined pollutant standard 
capital expenditures relating to controls contemplated by the combined pollutant standard could be significant and could make some units uneconomic to maintain or operate 
midwest generation may ultimately decide to comply with combined pollutant standard requirements by shutting down units rather than making improvements 
midwest generation is evaluating technology and unit shutdown combinations and compliance solutions  to determine the economic effects of compliance with the combined pollutant standard and optimal methods of compliance

eme is subject to extensive energy industry regulation 
eme s operations are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies 
eme s projects are subject to federal laws and regulations that govern  among other things  transactions by and with purchasers of power  including utility companies  the development and construction of generation facilities  the ownership and operations of generation facilities  and access to transmission 
under limited circumstances where exclusive federal jurisdiction is not applicable or specific exemptions or waivers from state or federal laws or regulations are otherwise unavailable  federal and or state utility regulatory commissions may have broad jurisdiction over non utility owned electric power plants 
the ferc may impose various forms of market mitigation measures  including price caps and operating restrictions  where it determines that potential market power might exist and that 
table of contents the public interest requires mitigation 
in addition  many of eme s facilities are subject to rules  restrictions and terms of participation imposed and administered by various regional transmission operators and independent system operators 
for example  independent system operators and regional transmission operators may impose bidding and scheduling rules  both to curb the potential exercise of market power and to facilitate market functions 
such actions may materially affect eme s results of operations 
generation facilities are also subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that govern  among other things  the geographical location  zoning  land use and operation of a project 
eme in the course of its business must obtain and periodically renew licenses  permits and approvals for its facilities 
there is no assurance that the introduction of new laws or other future regulatory developments will not have a material adverse effect on eme s business  results of operations or financial condition  nor is there any assurance that eme will be able to obtain and comply with all necessary licenses  permits and approvals for its projects 
if projects cannot comply with all applicable regulations  eme s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
market risks eme has substantial interests in merchant energy power plants which are subject to market risks related to wholesale energy prices 
eme s merchant energy power plants do not have long term power purchase agreements 
because the output of these power plants is not committed to be sold under long term contracts  these projects are subject to market forces which determine the amount and price of energy  capacity and ancillary services sold from the power plants 
the market price for energy  capacity and ancillary services is influenced by multiple factors beyond eme s control  which include changes in the demand for electricity or in patterns of electricity usage as a result of factors such as regional economic conditions and the implementation of conservation programs  weather conditions prevailing in surrounding areas from time to time  the availability  reliability and operation of competing power generation facilities  including nuclear generating plants where applicable  and the extended operation of such facilities beyond their presently expected dates of decommissioning  the extent of additional supplies of capacity  energy and ancillary services from current competitors or new market entrants  including the development of new generation facilities or technologies that may be able to produce electricity at a lower cost than eme s generating facilities and or increased access by competitors to eme s markets as a result of transmission upgrades  prevailing market prices for coal  natural gas and fuel oil  and associated transportation  the cost and availability of emission credits or allowances  transmission congestion within and to each market area and the resulting differences in prices between delivery points  
table of contents the ability of regional pools to pay market participants settlement prices for energy and related products  the market structure rules established for each market area and regulatory developments affecting the market areas  including any price limitations and other mechanisms adopted to address volatility or illiquidity in these markets or the physical stability of the system  and legal and political challenges to the rules used to calculate capacity payments in the markets in which eme operates 
in addition  unlike most other commodities  electric power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced when it is to be used 
as a result  the wholesale power markets are subject to significant and unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time 
due to the volume of sales into pjm from the fossil fueled facilities  eme has concentrated exposure to market conditions and fluctuations in pjm 
there is no assurance that eme s merchant energy power plants will be successful in selling power into their markets or that the prices received for their power will generate positive cash flows 
if eme s merchant energy power plants do not meet these objectives  they may not be able to generate enough cash to service their own debt and lease obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on eme 
eme s financial results can be affected by changes in fuel prices  fuel transportation cost increases  and interruptions in fuel supply 
eme s business is subject to changes in fuel costs  which may negatively affect its financial results and financial position by increasing the cost of producing power 
fuel costs can be influenced by many factors outside eme s control  including weather  market liquidity  transportation inefficiencies  demand for energy commodities both as fuel and as feedstock for manufacturing processes  natural gas  crude oil and coal production levels  natural disasters  wars  embargoes and other catastrophic events  governmental regulation and legislation  and the creditworthiness  liquidity and willingness of fuel suppliers and transporters to do business with eme and its subsidiaries 
the fuel markets can be volatile  and actual fuel prices can differ from eme s expectations 
although eme attempts to purchase fuel based on its expected requirements  it is still subject to the risks of supply interruptions  transportation cost increases  and fuel price volatility 
in addition  fuel deliveries will not exactly match energy sales  due in part to the need to purchase fuel inventories in advance for reliability and dispatch requirements 
the price at which eme can sell its energy may not rise or fall at the same rate as a corresponding rise or fall in fuel costs 
all of these factors may have an adverse effect on eme s financial condition and results of operations 
eme may not hedge market risks effectively 
eme is exposed to market risks through its ownership and operation of merchant energy power plants and through its power marketing business 
these market risks include  among others  volatility arising from the timing differences associated with buying fuel  converting fuel into energy and delivering energy to a buyer 
eme uses forward contracts and derivative 
table of contents instruments  such as futures contracts and options  to manage market risks and exposure to fluctuating electricity and fuel prices 
however  eme cannot provide assurance that these strategies will successfully mitigate market risks 
eme s hedging activities may not cover the entire exposure of its assets or positions to market price volatility  and the level of coverage will vary over time 
amounts hedged at any given time are not indicative of amounts that may be hedged in the future 
fluctuating commodity prices may affect eme s financial results  either favorably or unfavorably  to the extent that assets and positions have not been hedged 
in addition  eme s risk management strategies may not be as effective as anticipated 
the effectiveness of eme s hedging activities may depend on the amount of credit available to post collateral  either in support of performance guarantees or as a cash margin 
the amount of credit support that must be provided typically is based on the difference between the contract price of the commodity and its current market price 
significant movements in market prices can result in a requirement to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in very large amounts 
without adequate liquidity to meet margin and collateral requirements  eme could be exposed to the following a reduction in the number of counterparties willing to enter into bilateral contracts  which would result in increased reliance on short term and spot markets instead of bilateral contracts  increasing eme s exposure to market volatility  and a failure to meet a margin requirement  which could permit the counterparty to terminate the related bilateral contract early and demand immediate payment for the replacement value of the contract 
as a result of these and other factors  eme cannot predict the effect that risk management decisions may have on its business  operating results or financial position 
competition could adversely affect eme s business 
eme has numerous competitors in all aspects of its business some of whom may have greater liquidity  greater access to credit and other financial resources  lower cost structures  larger staffs or more experience than eme 
eme s competitors may be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to new laws and regulations or emerging technologies  or to devote greater resources to the development  operation  and maintenance of their power generation facilities than eme 
multiple participants in the wholesale markets  including many regulated utilities  have a lower cost of capital than most merchant generators and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms  allowing them to build  buy and upgrade generation assets without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments 
these factors could affect eme s ability to compete effectively in the markets in which those entities operate 
newer plants owned by eme s competitors are often more efficient than eme s facilities and may also have lower costs of operation 
over time  some of eme s merchant facilities may become obsolete in their markets  or be unable to compete with such plants 

table of contents in addition to the competition already existing in the markets in which eme presently operates or may consider operating in the future  eme is likely to encounter significant competition as a result of further consolidation of the power industry by mergers and asset reallocations  which could create larger competitors  as well as new market entrants 
financing risks eme may not be able to raise capital on favorable terms  which could adversely affect its results of operation 
liquidity is essential to eme s business 
eme cannot provide assurance that its projected sources of capital will be available when needed or that its actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected 
lack of available capital may affect eme s ability to complete environmental improvements at the fossil fueled facilities  which could lead to the eventual shutdown of a material part of such facilities 
lack of available capital could also affect eme s ability to complete the development of sites for renewable projects deploying current turbine commitments  which could lead to postponement or cancellation of the turbine commitments subject to the provisions of the related contracts 
eme cannot provide assurance that its projected sources of capital will be available when needed or that its actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected 
eme and its subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness  including long term lease obligations 
as of december   eme s consolidated debt was approximately billion 
in addition  eme s subsidiaries had billion of long term  power plant lease obligations that are due over a period ranging up to years 
the substantial amount of consolidated debt and financial obligations presents the risk that eme and its subsidiaries might not have sufficient cash to service their indebtedness or long term lease obligations and that the existing corporate debt  project debt and lease obligations could limit the ability of eme and its subsidiaries to grow their business  to compete effectively  to operate successfully under adverse economic conditions  to comply with evolving environmental regulations  or to plan for and react to business and industry changes 
if cash flows and capital resources were insufficient to cover scheduled debt payments  eme or its subsidiaries might have to reduce or delay capital expenditures including environmental improvements required by the cps  which could in turn lead to unit shutdowns  sell assets  seek additional capital  or restructure or refinance the debt 
the terms of eme s or its subsidiaries debt may not allow these alternative measures  the debt or equity may not be available on acceptable terms  and these alternative measures may not satisfy all scheduled debt service obligations 
eme conducts a substantial portion of its operations through its subsidiaries and may be limited in its ability to access funds from these subsidiaries to service its debt 
eme depends to a large degree upon dividends and other intercompany transfers of funds from its subsidiaries to meet debt service and other obligations 
in addition  the ability of eme s subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to eme may be restricted by  among other things  applicable corporate and other laws  potentially adverse tax 
table of contents consequences  and agreements entered into by the subsidiaries 
if eme is unable to access the cash flow of its subsidiaries  it may have difficulty meeting its own debt obligations 
restrictions in the instruments governing eme s indebtedness and the indebtedness and lease obligations of its subsidiaries limit eme s and its subsidiaries ability to enter into specified transactions that they otherwise might enter into 
the instruments governing eme s indebtedness and the indebtedness and lease obligations of its subsidiaries contain financial and investment covenants 
restrictions contained in these documents or documents eme or its subsidiaries enter in the future could affect  and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit  eme s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to  among other things  incur  refinance  and prepay debt  make capital expenditures  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments  create liens  sell assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  issue equity interests  enter into transactions with affiliates  create restrictions on the ability to pay dividends or make other distributions and engage in mergers and consolidations 
these restrictions may significantly impede eme s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise  to grow its business or to compete effectively 
in addition  these restrictions may significantly impede the ability of eme s subsidiaries to make distributions to eme 
in connection with the entry into new financings or amendments to existing financing arrangements  eme s financial and operational flexibility may be further reduced as a result of more restrictive covenants  requirements for security and other terms that are often imposed on sub investment grade entities 
operating risks eme s development projects or future acquisitions may not be successful 
eme s development activities are subject to risks including  without limitation  risks related to the identification of project sites  financing  construction  permitting  governmental approvals and the negotiation of project agreements  including power purchase agreements 
as a result of these risks  eme may not be successful in developing new projects  or the timing of such development may be delayed beyond the date that turbines are ready for installation 
projects under development may be adversely affected by delays in turbine deliveries or start up problems related to turbine performance  and agreements with off takers may contain damages and termination provisions related to failures to meet specified milestones 
moreover  recent economic conditions may affect the willingness of local utilities to enter into new power purchase agreements due to uncertainties over future load requirements  among other factors 
if a project under development is abandoned  eme would expense all capitalized costs incurred in connection with that project  and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities 
in support of its development activities  eme has entered into commitments to purchase wind turbines for future projects and may make substantial additional commitments in the future 
if eme is not successful in developing new projects  it may be required to cancel turbine orders or sell turbines that were purchased 
such cancellations and or sales may result in substantial losses and  under certain circumstances  may give rise to disputes with the turbine vendor 
in 
table of contents addition  eme cannot provide assurance that its development projects or acquired assets will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or to fund the capital expenditures needed to develop them  or that eme will ultimately realize a satisfactory rate of return 
eme s projects may be affected by general operating risks and hazards customary in the power generation industry 
eme may not have adequate insurance to cover all these hazards 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many operating risks  including performance below expected levels of output  efficiency or availability  interruptions in fuel supply  disruptions in the transmission of electricity  curtailment of operations due to transmission constraints  breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  shortages of equipment or spare parts  imposition of new regulatory  permitting  or environmental requirements  or violations of existing requirements  restrictions on emissions  releases of hazardous substances to air  soil  surface water or groundwater  inability to transport and dispose of coal ash at reasonable prices  employee work force factors  including strikes  work stoppages or labor disputes  operator contractor error  and catastrophic events such as terrorist activities  fires  tornadoes  earthquakes  explosions  floods or other similar occurrences affecting power generation facilities or the transmission and distribution infrastructure over which power is transported 
these and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  plant and equipment  contamination of or damage to the environment  and suspension of operations 
the occurrence of one or more of the events listed above could decrease or eliminate revenues generated by eme s projects or significantly increase the costs of operating them  and could also result in eme being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages  potentially including environmental cleanup costs  personal injury  property damage  fines and penalties 
unplanned outages typically increase operation and maintenance expenditures and reduce revenues 
eme could also be required to purchase replacement power in the open market to satisfy contractual commitments 
equipment and plant warranties  guarantees and insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances to cover lost revenues or increased expenses 
a decrease or elimination in revenues generated by the facilities or an increase in the costs of operating them could decrease or eliminate funds available to meet eme s obligations as they become due and could have a material adverse effect on eme 
a default 
table of contents under a financing obligation of a project entity could cause eme to lose its interest in the project 
the creditworthiness of eme s customers  suppliers  transporters and other business partners could affect eme s business and operations 
eme is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of its key customers  suppliers and business partners  many of whom may be adversely affected by the current conditions in the financial markets 
deterioration in the financial condition of eme s counterparties increases the possibility that eme may incur losses from the failure of counterparties to perform according to the terms of their contractual arrangements 
eme s operations depend on contracts for the supply and transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of its generation facilities and are exposed to the risk that counterparties to contracts will not perform their obligations 
if a fuel supplier or transporter failed to perform under a contract  eme would need to obtain alternate supplies or transportation  which could result in higher costs or disruptions in its operations 
if the defaulting counterparty is in poor financial condition  damages related to a breach of contract may not be recoverable 
accordingly  the failure of counterparties to fulfill their contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on eme s financial results

edison international s earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the united states 
management uses core earnings by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance 
core earnings by principal operating subsidiary are also used when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company s performance from period to period 
core earnings is a non gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies 
core earnings are defined as earnings attributable to edison international shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings  such as settlement of prior year tax liabilities  exit activities  including lease terminations  asset impairments  sale of certain assets  early debt extinguishment costs and other activities that are no longer continuing  and non recurring regulatory or legal proceedings 
sce s core earnings increased from primarily due to higher operating income associated with the cpuc and ferc general rate case decisions  partially offset by higher income taxes 
in addition  core earnings were favorably impacted from lower than planned financings during the year  primarily from cash received for tax related timing differences and other benefits 

table of contents during  sce received general rate case decisions from the cpuc and ferc  as follows the cpuc issued a decision in sce s grc  authorizing a billion revenue requirement for  an increase of million from sce s revenue requirement  effective january  the cpuc also authorized a methodology that would result in an approximate revenue requirement of billion in and billion in the ferc approved a settlement to the rate case effective march  the settlement provides for a transmission revenue requirement of million  an increase of million over the previously authorized amount 
emg core earnings were significantly lower than primarily due to the following lower wholesale energy prices reduced revenues from eme s merchant coal fired generation and trading operations 
the effects of the economic recession and mild weather during the summer months contributed to declines in electrical demand for the northern illinois and pjm west locations during electrical load  calculated from data published by pjm  for these locations declined and  respectively  during compared to in addition  the price of natural gas  which often serves as the marginal fuel source in the region  declined significantly 
the reduction in natural gas prices together with lower electrical demand resulted in significantly lower wholesale energy prices 
the average hour pjm real time price for energy at the northern illinois hub and the pjm west hub declined to mwh and mwh  respectively  during as compared to mwh and mwh  respectively  during lower electrical load contributed to decreased transmission congestion in the eastern power grid  thereby resulting in million lower trading income in as compared to higher costs were incurred at midwest generation to comply with the cair annual nox emission program that began in and new mercury emission controls 
partially offsetting these higher costs were cost reductions at midwest generation and homer city due in part to the deferral of plant overhaul activities 
lower earnings occurred at edison capital primarily due to a decline in lease income following the termination of cross border leases  which occurred as part of the global settlement with the internal revenue service 
consolidated changes in non core items for edison international include the following an after tax loss of million in resulted from the global settlement with the internal revenue service and termination of edison capital s cross border leases 
the loss is net of a million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter from a revised estimate of federal interest related to the settlement

environmental developments midwest generation environmental compliance plans and costs midwest generation is subject to various requirements with respect to environmental compliance for the midwest generation plants 
in  midwest generation entered into an agreement with the illinois epa  which has been embodied in an illinois rule called the cps  to control emission of mercury  nox and nox from its coal fired plants 
during and  midwest generation installed equipment to reduce its mercury emissions 
during  midwest generation also conducted tests of nox removal technology based on sncr and nox removal using flue gas desulfurization technology based on dry sodium sorbent injection that may be employed to meet cps requirements 
based on this testing  midwest generation has concluded that installation of sncr technology on multiple units will meet the nox 
table of contents portion of the cps 
capital expenditures for installation of sncr technology are expected to be approximately million in and million in testing of flue gas desulfurization technology based on injection of dry sodium sorbent demonstrated significant reductions in so emissions when using low sulfur coal employed by midwest generation  however  further analysis and evaluation are required to determine the appropriate method to comply with the so portion of the cps 
use of flue gas desulfurization technology based on injection of dry sodium sorbent in combination with midwest generation s use of low sulfur coal is expected to require substantially less capital and installation time than dry scrubber technology  but would likely result in higher ongoing operating costs and may consequently result in lower dispatch rates and competitiveness of the plants 
midwest generation may also combine the use of dry sorbent injection technology with upgrades to its particulate removal systems to meet environmental regulations 
midwest generation does not yet know what specific method of so removal will be used or the total costs that will be incurred to comply with the cps 
any and a decision regarding whether or not to proceed with the above or other approaches to compliance remains subject to further analysis and evaluation of several factors  including market conditions  regulatory and legislative developments and forecasted capital and operating costs 
due to existing uncertainties about these factors  midwest generation may defer final decisions about particular units for the maximum time available 
accordingly  final decisions on whether to install controls  the particular controls that will be installed  and the resulting capital commitments may not occur for up to two years for some of the units and potentially further out for others 
midwest generation could elect to shut down units when required in order to comply with the so removal requirements of the cps 
midwest generation continues to evaluate various scenarios and cannot predict the extent of shutdowns and retrofits or the particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns it may ultimately employ to comply with cps 
midwest generation new source review lawsuit in august  the us epa and the state of illinois filed a lawsuit against midwest generation in illinois federal court based on claims contained in a nov regarding alleged violations of the new source performance standards of the caa  the caa s title v operating permit requirements and applicable opacity and particulate matter standards 
midwest generation is contesting such claims 
the lawsuit seeks  among other things  substantial monetary penalties and an injunction requiring midwest generation to install controls sufficient to meet bact emissions rates as determined by the court at all units subject to the lawsuit 
see item legal proceedings midwest generation new source review lawsuit for further discussion 
should liability of midwest generation be established  remedies ordered by the court could go beyond what is required for compliance with the cps 
homer city environmental issues and capital resource limitations homer city operates scr equipment on all three units to reduce nox emissions  operates flue gas desulfurization equipment on unit to reduce so emissions  and uses coal cleaning equipment onsite to reduce the ash and sulfur content of raw coal to meet both combustion and environmental requirements 
homer city may be required to install additional 
table of contents environmental equipment on unit and unit to comply with environmental regulations under the cair and pennsylvania mercury regulations 
if required  the timing of such compliance remains uncertain 
homer city projects that if flue gas desulfurization equipment becomes required  it would need to make capital commitments for such equipment three to four years in advance of the effectiveness of such requirements 
homer city continues to review technologies available to reduce so and mercury emissions and to monitor developments related to mercury and other environmental regulations 
restrictions under the agreements entered into as part of homer city s sale leaseback transaction could affect  and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit  homer city s ability to incur indebtedness or make capital expenditures 
homer city will have limited ability to obtain additional outside capital for such projects without amending its lease and related agreements 
eme is under no contractual or other obligation to provide funding to homer city 
greenhouse gas regulation developments the nature of future environmental regulation and legislation will have a substantial impact on edison international 
edison international believes that resolution of current uncertainties about the future  through well balanced and appropriately flexible regulation and legislation  is needed to support the necessary evolution of the electric industry into using cleaner  more efficient infrastructure and to attract the capital ultimately needed for this effort 
legislative  regulatory  and legal developments related to potential controls over greenhouse gas emissions in the united states are ongoing 
actions to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels as well as the cost of purchased power 
in the case of utilities  like sce  these costs are generally borne by customers  whereas the increased costs for competitive generators  like eme  must be recovered through market prices for electricity 
recent significant developments include the following legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions continues to be considered by congress  however  the timing  content  and potential effects on edison international and its subsidiaries of any greenhouse gas legislation that may be enacted remain uncertain 
in december  the us epa issued a final finding that certain greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  threaten the public health and welfare 
the us epa has issued a proposed rule  known as the greenhouse gas tailoring rule  under which all new and major modifications of existing stationary sources emitting  metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually  including power plants  would be required to include bact to minimize their greenhouse gas emissions 
since the current proposal affects only new or modified sources  it is not expected to have any immediate effect  if adopted  on existing fossil fuel generating stations of sce  midwest generation or homer city  but it could affect the cost of new construction or modifications 
us epa could also use its authority in the future to regulate existing sources of greenhouse gas emissions 
if controls are required to be installed at the facilities of edison international subsidiaries in the future in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to regulations issued by the us epa or others  the potential impact will depend on the nature of the controls applied  which remains uncertain 

table of contents three recent court cases addressed the question of whether power plants that emit greenhouse gases constituted public nuisances that could be held liable for damages or other remedies 
in one case in which edison international is a named defendant a california federal district court dismissed the plaintiffs claims 
in the other two  federal courts of appeals permitted the suits to go forward 
each of these differing results remains subject to appeal and thus the ultimate impact of these cases remains uncertain 
edison international cannot predict whether these recent decisions will result in the filing of new actions with similar claims or whether congress  in considering climate legislation  will address directly the availability of courts for these sorts of claims 
governor schwarzenegger issued an executive order to increase california s renewable energy goals from to and has directed the carb to adopt a regulation consistent with of retail sellers annual electricity sales being obtained from renewable energy sources by achieving a renewables portfolio standard in this timeframe is highly ambitious  given the magnitude of the infrastructure build out required and the slow pace of transmission permitting and approvals 
the carb is also considering a number of direct regulations to reduce greenhouse gases in california  which requirements could go beyond those ultimately imposed by congress or the us epa 
once through cooling last year  the california state water resources board released a draft policy  which would establish closed cycle wet cooling as required technology for retrofitting existing once through cooled plants like san onofre and many of the existing gas fired power plants along the california coast 
if the policy is adopted by the board  it may result in significant capital expenditures at san onofre and may affect its operations 
it may also significantly impact sce s ability to procure generating capacity from fossil fuel plants that use ocean water in once through cooling systems 
it may also impact system reliability and the cost of electricity to the extent other coastal power plants in california are forced to shut down or limit operations 
the policy has the potential to adversely affect california s nineteen once through cooled power plants  which provide over  mw of combined  in state generation capacity  including over  mw of capacity interconnected within sce s service territory 
eme renewable program eme has a development pipeline of potential wind projects with projected installed capacity of approximately  mw at january  compared to approximately  mw at december  the decline in the pipeline is primarily due to the transfer of projects into construction and cost containment efforts resulting in the reduction in the number of projects funded under our joint development agreements 
eme had purchase contracts for mw of wind turbines for future projects as of december  eme plans to deploy these wind turbines when projects meet acceptable financial thresholds  have long term power sales agreements  and can attract long term project financing 
if eme is unable to develop such projects on acceptable terms and conditions  certain turbine orders may be terminated 
such an event would likely result in a material charge 
at december   eme had two projects under construction the mw big sky wind project  and the mw cedro hill wind project  which are scheduled for completion in 
table of contents early and late  respectively 
eme has obtained financing for the big sky wind project million 
during the first quarter of  eme commenced construction of the mw taloga wind project located in oklahoma and executed a power sales agreement for an mw project located in nebraska  referred to as the laredo ridge wind project

table of contents southern california edison company results of operations sce s results of operations are derived mainly through two sources utility earning activities  which mainly represent cpuc and ferc authorized base rates  which allow a reasonable return  and cpuc authorized incentive mechanisms  and utility cost recovery activities  which mainly represent cpuc authorized balancing accounts  which allow recovery of costs incurred or provide mechanisms to track and recover or refund differences in forecasted and actual amounts 
balancing accounts do not allow for a return 
utility earning activities include base rates that are designed to recover forecasted operation and maintenance costs  certain capital related carrying costs  interest  taxes and a return  including the return on capital projects recovered through balancing account mechanisms 
differences between authorized and actual results impact earnings 
also  included in utility earning activities are revenues or penalties related to incentive mechanisms  other operating revenue  and regulatory charges or disallowances  if any 
utility cost recovery activities include rates which provide for recovery  subject to reasonableness review  of fuel costs  purchased power costs  public purpose related program costs including energy efficiency and demand side management programs  nuclear decommissioning expense  certain operation and maintenance expenses  and depreciation expense related to certain projects

solar rooftop program in june  the cpuc approved sce s solar photovoltaic program to develop up to mw of utility owned solar photovoltaic generating facilities generally ranging in size from to mw each  on commercial and industrial rooftops and other space in sce s service territory 
the decision allows sce to recover its reasonable costs in customer rates and its cpuc authorized rate of return on its investment 
sce expects to spend billion over the period on this project 

table of contents regulatory proceedings cost of capital mechanism in  the cpuc granted sce s request to forgo an expected cost of capital increase under the annual adjustment provision and extended sce s existing capital structure and authorized rate of return of through december  absent any future potential annual adjustments 
the revised mechanism will be subject to cpuc review in for the cost of capital set for and beyond 
ferc rate case on september   ferc issued an order allowing sce to implement its proposed rates  subject to refund and settlement procedures  effective march  the proposed rates would increase sce s revenue requirement by million  or  over the revenue requirement primarily due to an increase in transmission rate base and would result in an approximate increase to sce s overall system average rate 
sce is currently in settlement negotiations with the ferc staff and multiple intervenors 
dividend restrictions the cpuc regulates sce s capital structure and limits the dividends it may pay edison international 
in sce s most recent cost of capital proceeding  the cpuc set an authorized capital structure for sce which included a common equity component of 
sce may make distributions to edison international as long as the common equity component of sce s capital structure remains at or above the authorized level on a month weighted average basis 
at december   sce s month weighted average common equity component of total capitalization was resulting in the capacity to pay million in additional dividends 
during  sce made a total of million of dividend payments to its parent  edison international and declared a million dividend to edison international which was paid in january future dividend amounts and timing of distributions are dependent upon several factors including the actual level of capital investments  operating cash flows and earnings 
income tax matters sce is included in the consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns of edison international and participates in tax allocation payments with other subsidiaries of edison international in accordance with the terms of intercompany tax allocation agreements among the edison international affiliated companies 
significant activities occurred during that will have an impact on sce s future cash flows

table of contents repair deductions during the fourth quarter of  edison international made a voluntary election to change its tax accounting method for certain repair costs incurred on sce s transmission  distribution and generation assets 
the change in tax accounting method resulted in an initial million cash benefit realized in the fourth quarter of this benefit was based primarily on an estimated cumulative catch up deduction for certain repair costs that were previously capitalized and depreciated over the tax depreciable life of the property 
additional information and analysis is required to determine the actual deduction that will ultimately be reflected on the income tax return due to be filed in september which may result in additional cash benefits 
the current income tax benefit from the change in accounting for repair costs represents a timing difference which will reverse over the remaining tax life of the assets 
this method change did not impact sce s results of operations 
recovery of the future increase in income taxes related to this matter is expected to be addressed in sce s grc 
due to the uncertainty over this recovery  sce did not recognize an earnings benefit or regulatory asset in margin and collateral deposits certain derivative instruments and power procurement contracts under sce s power and natural gas hedging activities contain collateral requirements 
sce has historically provided collateral in the form of cash and or letters of credit for the benefit of counterparties 
collateral requirements can vary depending upon the level of unsecured credit extended by counterparties  changes in market prices relative to contractual commitments  and other factors 
future collateral requirements may be higher or lower than requirements at december   due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements  if any  and the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on sce s contractual obligations 
certain of these power contracts contain a provision that requires sce to maintain an investment grade credit rating from the major credit rating agencies 
if sce s credit rating were to fall below investment grade  sce may be required to pay the liability or post additional collateral 
the table below illustrates the amount of collateral posted by sce to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would be required as of december  in millions collateral posted as of december  incremental collateral requirements resulting from a potential downgrade of sce s credit rating to below investment grade total posted and potential collateral requirements collateral posted consisted of million in cash reflected in margin and collateral deposits on the consolidated balance sheets and million in letters of credit 
total posted and potential collateral requirements may increase by an additional million  based on sce s forward position as of december   due to adverse market price movements over the remaining life of the existing contracts using a confidence level 

table of contents in the table above  there was zero collateral posted as of december  related to derivative liabilities  and million of incremental collateral requirements related to derivative liabilities 
sce s incremental collateral requirements are expected to be met from liquidity available from cash on hand and available capacity under sce s credit facilities  discussed above

market risk exposures sce s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  commodity prices and volumes  and counterparty credit 
fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows 
fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes and counterparty credit losses may temporarily affect cash flows  but are not expected to affect earnings due to expected recovery through regulatory mechanisms 
sce uses derivative financial instruments  as appropriate  to manage its market risks 
interest rate risk sce is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing and short term investing activities used for liquidity purposes  to fund business operations and to fund capital investments 
the nature and amount of sce s long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors

sce recovers its related hedging costs  through the erra balancing account  subject to reasonableness review  and as a result  exposure to commodity price is not expected to impact earnings  but may impact cash flows 
electricity price exposure arises from the following activities energy purchased and sold in the mrtu market as a result of differences between sce s load requirements versus the amount of energy delivered from sce s generating facilities  existing bilateral contracts  and cdwr contracts allocated to sce 
in march  sce began participating in the mrtu day ahead and real time markets which uses nodal locational marginal prices and is subject to price caps 
the volume purchased in the mrtu market may vary due to outages at sce s generating facilities  new or expired bilateral contracts and changes in customer demand resulting from  among other things  growth or decline in customer base and weather 
natural gas price exposure arises from the following activities natural gas purchased for generation at mountainview and peaker plants 
the volume purchased may vary due to outages and dispatch based on sce s management of its load requirements 
bilateral contracts where pricing is based on natural gas prices 
contract energy prices for some qfs are based on the monthly index price of natural gas delivered at the southern california border 
approximately of sce s purchased power supply is subject to natural gas price volatility 
power contracts in which sce has agreed to provide the natural gas needed for generation  referred to as tolling arrangements 
volume may vary due to dispatch based on sce s management of its load requirements or if the existing cdwr power contracts  which have related natural gas supply contracts  are novated or replaced and sce becomes a party to such contracts 
sce is currently unable to predict which or how many existing cdwr contracts will be novated or replaced 
however  due to the expected recovery through regulatory mechanisms these power procurement expenses are not expected to affect earnings 
natural gas and electricity price risk sce s hedging program reduces ratepayer exposure to variability in market prices 
as part of this program  sce enters into energy options  swaps  forward arrangements  tolling arrangements  and congestion revenue rights crrs 
the transactions are pre approved by the cpuc or executed in compliance with cpuc approved procurement plans 
in addition  sce s risk management committee monitors exposure related to these instruments 
sce records its derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value unless they meet the definition of a normal purchase or sale or are classified as vies or leases 
the derivative instrument fair values are marked to market at each reporting period 
any fair value changes are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and therefore  sce s fair value changes have no impact on purchased power expense or earnings 
sce does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment 

table of contents fair value of derivative instruments sce follows the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value measurements 
for further discussion see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements 
the following table summarizes the fair values of outstanding derivative instruments used at sce to mitigate its exposure to spot market prices december  december  in millions assets liabilities assets liabilities electricity options  swaps and forward arrangements natural gas options  swaps and forward arrangements congestion revenue rights and firm transmission rights tolling arrangements netting and collateral total the caiso created a commodity  crrs  which entitles the holder to receive or pay the value to transmission congestion between specific nodes  acting as an economic hedge against transmission congestion charges 
in september and november  the caiso allocated crrs for the period april through december based on sce s load requirements 
in addition  sce participated in caiso auctions for the procurement of additional crrs 
the crrs meet the definition of a derivative 
in compliance with a cpuc mandate  sce held an open  competitive solicitation that produced agreements with different project developers who have agreed to construct new southern california generating resources 
the contracts provide for fixed capacity payments as well as pricing for energy delivered based on a heat rate and contractual operation and maintenance prices 
however  due to uncertainty regarding the availability of required emission credits  some of the generating resources may not be constructed and the contracts associated with these resources could therefore terminate  at which time sce would no longer account for these contracts as derivatives 
in millions fair value of derivative contracts  net at january  total realized unrealized net gains included in regulatory assets and liabilities purchases and settlements  net netting and collateral fair value of derivative contracts  net at december  due to regulatory mechanisms  sce s realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities 
sce recognizes realized gains and losses on derivative instruments as purchased power expense and recovers these costs from ratepayers 
as a result  realized gains and losses do not affect earnings  but may temporarily affect cash flows 
due to expected future recovery from ratepayers  unrealized gains and losses are deferred and are not recognized as purchased power expense  and therefore do not affect earnings 
realized losses on economic hedging activities were primarily due to settled natural gas prices being significantly lower than transactional average fixed prices 
unrealized gains on economic hedging activities were primarily due to changes in the expected forward prices of the crrs  the rising volatilities related to sce s contracts from the new generation contracts  and settlement of gas contracts during the period 

table of contents the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair values of outstanding derivative financial instruments as of december   if the electricity prices or gas prices were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant in millions increase in electricity prices by decrease in electricity prices by increase in gas prices by decrease in gas prices by electricity options  swaps and forward arrangements natural gas options  swaps and forward arrangements congestion revenue rights and firm transmission rights tolling arrangements credit risk as part of sce s procurement activities  sce contracts with a number of utilities  energy companies  financial institutions  and other companies  collectively referred to as counterparties 
if a counterparty were to default on its contractual obligations  sce could be exposed to potentially volatile spot markets for buying replacement power or selling excess power 
in addition  sce would be exposed to the risk of non payment of accounts receivable  primarily related to sales of excess energy and realized gains on derivative instruments 
however  all of the contracts that sce has entered into with counterparties are either entered into under sce s short term or long term procurement plan which has been approved by the cpuc  or the contracts are approved by the cpuc before becoming effective 
as a result of regulatory recovery mechanisms  losses from non performance are not expected to affect earnings  but may temporarily affect cash flows 
to manage credit risk  sce looks at the risk of a potential default by counterparties 
credit risk is measured by the loss that would be incurred if counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
sce measures  monitors and mitigates credit risk to the extent possible 
sce manages the credit risk on the portfolio based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information  such as financial statements  regulatory filings  and press releases  to guide it in the process of setting credit levels  risk limits and contractual arrangements  including master netting agreements 
sce s risk management committee regularly reviews and evaluates procurement credit exposure and approves credit limits for transacting with counterparties 
despite this  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be wholly successful in mitigating credit risk or that collateral pledged will be adequate 
sce anticipates future delivery of energy by counterparties  but given the current market condition  sce cannot predict whether the counterparties will be able to continue operations and deliver energy under the contractual agreements 
the credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable accounts receivable less accounts payable and the current fair value of net derivative assets derivative assets less derivative liabilities reflected on the balance sheet 
sce enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of setoff 
accordingly  sce s credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements 

table of contents as of december   the amount of balance sheet exposure as described above  broken down by the credit ratings of sce s counterparties  was as follows december  in millions exposure collateral net exposure s p credit rating a or higher a bbb bbb bbb below investment grade and not rated total sce assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty s s p or moody s rating 
for ease of reference  the above table uses the s p classifications to summarize risk  but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings 
exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchase and sales and non derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  except for any related net accounts receivable 
the credit risk exposure set forth in the above table is comprised of million of net account receivables and million representing the fair value  adjusted for counterparty credit reserves  of derivative contracts 
the caiso comprises of the total net exposure above and is mainly related to the crrs fair value see commodity price risk for further information

non gaap disclosures fossil fueled facilities adjusted operating income loss aoi is equal to operating income plus other income expense for the fossil fueled facilities 
aoi is a non gaap performance measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies 
management believes that inclusion of other income expense is meaningful for investors as the components of other income expense are integral to the results of the fossil fueled facilities 
seasonal disclosure fossil fueled facilities in  the seasonal fluctuations in electric demand normally occurring for the fossil fueled facilities were minimized by milder winter conditions and cooler than normal summer months 
normally  due to fluctuations in electric demand resulting from warmer weather during the summer months and cold weather during the winter months  electric revenues from the fossil fueled facilities vary substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  maintenance outages generally are scheduled during periods of lower projected electric demand spring and fall further reducing generation and increasing major maintenance costs which are recorded as an expense when incurred 
accordingly  aoi from the fossil fueled facilities are seasonal and have significant variability from quarter to quarter 
seasonal fluctuations may also be affected by changes in market prices

accounting for derivative instruments eme uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks that arise from fluctuations in the prices of electricity  capacity  fuel  emission allowances  and transmission rights 
for derivative instruments recorded at fair value  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings at the end of each accounting period unless the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting 
for derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  changes in their fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item settles and is recognized in earnings 
however  the ineffective portion of a derivative that qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting is recognized currently in earnings 

table of contents eme classifies unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments as part of operating revenues or fuel expenses

non trading derivative instruments the fair value of outstanding non trading commodity derivative instruments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
in assessing the fair value of eme s non trading commodity derivative instruments  eme uses quoted market prices and forward market prices adjusted for credit risk 
the fair value of commodity price contracts takes into account quoted market prices  time value of money  volatility of the underlying commodities and other factors 
the decrease in the fair value of commodity contracts at december  as compared to december  is attributable to the settlement of contracts in that were entered into in at higher prices than contracts outstanding at december  a change in the market price of the underlying commodity at december  would increase or decrease the fair value of outstanding non trading commodity derivative instruments by approximately million 
since these non trading commodity derivative instruments are economic hedges  an increase or decrease in fair value would be offset by an increase or decrease in the cash flows of the underlying asset 
the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in cash flows from the economically hedged item may not be recognized in operating revenues in the same periods

laredo ridge wind project the laredo ridge wind project is an mw wind project in nebraska scheduled for completion in late in february  eme allocated turbines under one of its existing turbine supply agreements for wind turbines to complete the laredo ridge wind project 
the remaining costs to complete the project  including turbine payments  construction  and turbine transportation and installation  are expected to be approximately million 
the laredo ridge wind project is being developed under a joint development agreement 
eme intends to purchase the project in the second quarter of the project has contracted to sell power to the nebraska public power district under a year power sales contract 

table of contents estimated expenditures for future projects eme had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with projected installed capacity of approximately  mw at january  the development pipeline represents potential projects with respect to which eme either owns the project rights or has exclusive acquisition rights 
eme has wind turbines in storage and on order for wind projects under construction and to be used for future wind projects turbine commitments are reflected separately in the preceding capital expenditure table 
successful completion of development of a wind project depends upon obtaining permits and agreements necessary to support an investment and may take a number of years due to factors that include local permit requirements  willingness of local utilities to purchase renewable power at sufficient prices to earn an appropriate rate of return  and availability and prices of equipment 
walnut creek project walnut creek energy  a subsidiary of eme  was awarded by sce  through a competitive bidding process  a year power sales contract starting in for the output of a mw gas fired peaking facility located in the city of industry  california  which is referred to as the walnut creek project 
in july  the los angeles superior court found that actions taken by the scaqmd  in promulgating rules that had made available a priority reserve of emissions credits for new power generation projects  did not satisfy california environmental laws 
in a november decision  the los angeles superior court enjoined scaqmd from issuing priority reserve emission credits to walnut creek and other projects 
legal challenges related to the priority reserve emission credits are continuing 
legislation that passed the state assembly and is currently pending in the senate would provide access to the credits for walnut creek  subject to further regulatory steps and litigation risk 
in the air basins regulated by scaqmd  the need for particulate matter pm and so emission credits exceeds available supply  and it is difficult to create new qualifying credits 
construction on the walnut creek project will not begin until its access to the priority reserve emission credits is restored or another source of credits is identified 
the capital costs to construct this project  excluding interest  are estimated in the range of million to million

condensed consolidated statement of cash flows years ended december  in millions operating cash flow from continuing operations operating cash flow from discontinued operations net cash provided used by operating activities net cash provided used by financing activities net cash provided used by investing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents consolidated cash flows used by operating activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the impacts of the global settlement which resulted in net tax allocation payments to edison international of billion by edison capital related to the termination of edison capital s interests in cross border leases 
lower realized revenues due to lower market prices in  compared to and a decrease in margin deposits received from counterparties at december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily attributable to million in margin deposits received from counterparties at december   partially offset by the purchase of annual nox emission allowances in by midwest generation 
consolidated cash flows used by financing activities the increase in cash used by financing activities from continuing operations was attributable to repayments of million and million under eme s corporate credit facility and midwest generation s working capital facility  respectively 
these repayments were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of a million term loan as part of a million project financing completed in june the increase in cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was attributable to an increase in borrowings in under eme s corporate credit facility and midwest generation s working capital facility 
in addition  eme received million from the minority shareholders of the elkhorn ridge wind project 

table of contents consolidated cash flows used by investing activities cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to billion of net proceeds from termination of the cross border leases at edison capital 
excluding this impact and the impact of changes in short term investments described below  cash provided by investing activities is related to capital expenditures and investments in other assets primarily turbine deposits and pre construction costs 
the amount of capital expenditures and investment in other assets were million in  million in and million in the changes in the level of expenditures are primarily due to investments for renewable energy projects 
included in investments in other assets were turbine deposits for wind projects prior to the commencement of construction of million in  million in  and million in the change in short term investments is reflected as investing activities in the cash flow statement 
investments with maturity dates less than days are considered cash equivalents and are classified as part of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet 
maturities of short term investments are included as a source of cash from investing activities and have decreased during the past two years primarily due to eme curtailing its purchase of short term investments 
other factors that impacted investing activities included payments of million and million during and  respectively  toward the purchase price of wind projects  proceeds of million from the sale of of eme s membership interest in the elkhorn ridge wind project during the second quarter of  and payments of million during towards the purchase price of new wind projects  payment of million during to acquire an option to purchase specific projects  and payments of million towards the purchase price of the wildorado wind project during credit ratings overview credit ratings for eme  midwest generation and emmt are as follows moody s rating s p rating fitch rating eme b b bb midwest generation ba bb bbb emmt not rated b not rated senior unsecured rating 
first priority senior secured rating 
the s p and fitch ratings are on negative outlook  while the moody s rating outlook is stable 
eme cannot provide assurance that its current credit ratings or the credit ratings of its 
table of contents subsidiaries will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered 
eme notes that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold its securities and may be revised at any time by a rating agency 
eme does not have any rating triggers contained in subsidiary financings that would result in it being required to make equity contributions or provide additional financial support to its subsidiaries  including emmt 
however  coal contracts at midwest generation include provisions that provide the right to request additional collateral to support payment obligations for delivered coal and may vary based on midwest generation s credit ratings 
furthermore  emmt also has hedge contracts that do not require margin  but contain the right of each party to request additional credit support in the form of adequate assurance of performance in the case of an adverse development affecting the other party 
for discussions of contingent features related to energy contracts  see margin  collateral deposits and other credit support for energy contracts 
credit rating of emmt the homer city sale leaseback documents restrict homer city s ability to enter into derivative activities  as defined in the documents  with emmt to sell forward the output of the homer city facilities if emmt does not have an investment grade credit rating from s p or moody s or  in the absence of those ratings  if it is not rated as investment grade pursuant to eme s internal credit scoring procedures 
these documents also include a requirement that homer city s counterparty to such transactions  whether it is emmt or another party  and homer city  if acting as seller to an unaffiliated third party  be investment grade 
eme currently sells all the output from the homer city facilities through emmt  which has a below investment grade credit rating  and homer city is not rated 
in order to continue to sell forward the output of the homer city facilities through emmt  eme has obtained a consent from the sale leaseback owner participants that allows homer city to enter into such sales  under specified conditions  through march  homer city continues to be in compliance with the terms of the consent  however  because emmt s credit rating has dropped below bb  the consent is revocable by the sale leaseback owner participants at any time 
the sale leaseback owner participants have not indicated that they intend to revoke the consent  however  there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future 
an additional consequence of emmt s lowered credit rating is that outstanding accounts receivable between emmt and homer city have been reduced to zero  as required under the terms of the consent 
revocation of the consent would not affect trades between emmt and homer city that had been entered into while the consent was still in effect 
eme is permitted to sell the output of the homer city facilities into the spot market on the terms set forth in the homer city sale leaseback documents

table of contents support 
eme has entered into guarantees in support of emmt s hedging and trading activities  however  eme has historically also provided collateral in the form of cash and letters of credit for the benefit of counterparties related to the net of accounts payable  accounts receivable  unrealized losses  and unrealized gains in connection with these hedging and trading activities 
at december   emmt had deposited million in cash with clearing brokers in support of futures contracts and had deposited million in cash with counterparties in support of forward energy and congestion contracts 
cash collateral provided to others offset against derivative liabilities totaled million at december  in addition  eme had received cash collateral of million at december   to support credit risk of counterparties under margin agreements  million of which is classified as restricted cash 
the liability for margin deposits received from counterparties has been offset against net derivative assets 
future cash collateral requirements may be higher than the margin and collateral requirements at december   if wholesale energy prices change or additional transactions are entered into 
eme estimates that margin and collateral requirements for energy and congestion contracts outstanding as of december  could increase by approximately million over the remaining life of the contracts using a confidence level 
this increase may not be offset by similar changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged items in the same periods 
certain emmt hedge contracts do not require margin  but contain provisions that require eme or midwest generation to comply with the terms and conditions of their credit facilities 
the credit facilities contain financial covenants which are described further in dividend restrictions in major financings 
furthermore  the hedge contracts include provisions relating to a change in control or material adverse effect resulting from amendments or modifications to the related credit facility 
emmt also has hedge contracts that do not require margin  but contain the right of each party to request additional credit support in the form of adequate assurance of performance in the case of an adverse development affecting the other party 
the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features is in an asset position on december  and  accordingly  the contingent features described above do not currently have a liquidity exposure 
future increases in power prices could expose eme or midwest generation to termination payments or additional collateral postings under the contingent features described above 
midwest generation has cash on hand and a credit facility to support margin requirements specifically related to contracts entered into by emmt related to the midwest generation plants 
in addition  eme has cash on hand and a credit facility to provide credit support to subsidiaries

a rent default event is defined as the failure to pay the equity portion of the rent within five business days of when it is due 
eme has not guaranteed homer city s obligations under the leases 
corporate credit facility restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries eme s corporate credit agreement contains covenants that restrict its ability and the ability of several of its subsidiaries to make distributions 
this restriction impacts the subsidiaries that own interests in the westside projects  the sunrise project  the fossil fueled facilities  and the big projects 
these subsidiaries would not be able to make a distribution to eme s shareholder if an event of default were to occur and be continuing under eme s secured credit agreement after giving effect to the distribution

off balance sheet transactions emg has off balance sheet transactions in three principal areas investments in projects accounted for under the equity method  operating leases resulting from sale leaseback transactions and leveraged leases 
investments accounted for under the equity method eme has a number of investments in power projects that are accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method  the project assets and related liabilities are not consolidated on eme s consolidated balance sheet 
rather  eme s financial statements reflect its investment in each entity and it records only its proportionate ownership share of net income or loss 
eme owns a number of domestic energy projects through partnerships in which it has a or less ownership interest 
entities formed to own these projects are generally structured with a management committee in which eme exercises significant influence but cannot exercise unilateral control over the operating  funding or construction activities of the project entity 
two of these projects have long term debt that is secured by a pledge of the assets of the project entity  but do not provide for any recourse to eme 
accordingly  a default on a long term financing of a project could result in foreclosure on the assets of the project entity resulting in a loss of some or all of eme s project investment  but would not require eme to contribute additional capital 
at december   entities which eme has accounted for under the equity method had indebtedness of million  of which million is proportionate to eme s ownership interest in these projects 
edison capital has invested in affordable housing projects utilizing partnership or limited liability companies in which edison capital is a limited partner or limited liability member 
in these entities  edison capital usually owns a interest 
with a few exceptions  an unrelated general partner or managing member exercises operating control  voting rights of edison capital are limited by agreement to certain significant organizational matters 
edison capital has subsequently sold a majority of these interests to unrelated third party investors through syndication partnerships in which edison capital has retained an interest  with one

each lease sets forth a termination value payable upon termination for default and in certain other circumstances  which generally declines over time and in the case of default may be reduced by the proceeds arising from the sale of the repossessed power plant 
a default under the terms of the powerton and joliet or homer city leases could result in a loss of eme s ability to use such power plant 
in addition  a default under the terms of the powerton and joliet leases would trigger obligations under eme s guarantee of such leases

table of contents market risk exposures emg s primary market risk exposures are associated with the sale of electricity and capacity from  and the procurement of fuel for  its merchant power plants 
these market risks arise from fluctuations in the prices of electricity  capacity  fuel  emission allowances  and transmission rights 
additionally  eme s financial results can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
eme manages these risks in part by using derivative instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
commodity price risk eme s merchant operations create exposure to commodity price risk  which reflects the potential impact of a change in the market value of a particular commodity 
commodity price risks are actively monitored  with oversight provided by a risk management committee  to ensure compliance with eme s risk management policies 
policies are in place which define risk management processes  and procedures exist which allow for monitoring of all commitments and positions with regular reviews by eme s risk management committee 
despite this  there can be no assurance that all risks have been accurately identified  measured and or mitigated 
in addition to prevailing market prices  eme s ability to derive profits from the sale of electricity will be affected by the cost of production  including costs incurred to comply with environmental regulations 
the costs of production of the units vary and  accordingly  depending on market conditions  the amount of generation that will be sold from the units may vary 
eme uses estimates of the variability in gross margin to help identify  measure  monitor and control its overall market risk exposure and earnings volatility with respect to hedge positions at the fossil fueled facilities  and the merchant wind projects  and uses value at risk metrics to help identify  measure  monitor and control its overall risk exposure with respect to its trading positions 
these measures allow management to aggregate overall commodity risk  compare risk on a consistent basis and identify changes in risk factors 
value at risk measures the possible loss  and variability in gross margin measures the potential change in value  of an asset or position  in each case over a given time interval  under normal market conditions  at a given confidence level 
given the inherent limitations of these measures and reliance on a single type of risk measurement tool  eme supplements these approaches with the use of stress testing and worst case scenario analysis for key risk factors  as well as stop loss triggers volumetric exposure limits 
energy price risk affecting sales from the fossil fueled facilities energy and capacity from the fossil fueled facilities are sold under terms  including price  duration and quantity  arranged by emmt with customers through a combination of bilateral agreements resulting from negotiations or from auctions  forward energy sales and spot market sales 
power is sold into pjm at spot prices based upon locational marginal pricing 
hedging transactions related to generation are generally entered into at the northern illinois hub or the aep dayton hub  both in pjm  for the midwest generation plants and generally 
table of contents at the pjm west hub for the homer city facilities 
these trading hubs have been the most liquid locations for hedging purposes 
see basis risk below for further discussion 
the following table depicts the average historical market prices for energy per megawatt hour at the locations indicated hour average historical market prices midwest generation plants northern illinois hub homer city facilities pjm west hub homer city busbar energy prices were calculated at the respective delivery points using historical hourly real time prices as published by pjm or provided on the pjm web site 
the following table sets forth the forward market prices for energy per megawatt hour as quoted for sales into the northern illinois hub and pjm west hub at december  hour forward energy prices northern illinois hub pjm west hub calendar strip calendar strip energy prices were determined by obtaining broker quotes and information from other public sources relating to the northern illinois hub and pjm west hub delivery point 
market price for energy purchases for the entire calendar year 
forward market prices at the northern illinois hub and pjm west hub fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including natural gas prices  transmission congestion  changes in market rules  electricity demand which in turn is affected by weather  economic growth  and other factors  plant outages in the region  and the amount of existing and planned power plant capacity 
the actual spot prices for electricity delivered by the fossil fueled facilities into these markets may vary materially from the forward market prices set forth in the preceding table 

table of contents emmt engages in hedging activities for the fossil fueled facilities to hedge the risk of future change in the price of electricity 
the following table summarizes the hedge positions as of december  for electricity expected to be generated in and mwh in thousands average price mwh mwh in thousands average price mwh midwest generation plants northern illinois and aep dayton hubs homer city facilities pjm west hub total the above hedge positions include forward contracts for the sale of power and futures contracts during different periods of the year and the day 
market prices tend to be higher during on peak periods and during summer months  although there is significant variability of power prices during different periods of time 
accordingly  the above hedge positions are not directly comparable to the hour northern illinois hub or pjm west hub prices set forth above 
furthermore  the average price mwh for homer city s hedge position is based on the pjm west hub 
energy prices at the homer city busbar have been lower than energy prices at the pjm west hub 
in addition  as of december   emmt has entered into billion cubic feet of natural gas futures contracts equivalent to approximately gwh of energy only contracts using a ratio of mmbtu to mwh for the midwest generation plants to economically hedge energy price risks during at an average price of mwh 
capacity price risk on june   pjm implemented the rpm for capacity 
under the rpm  capacity commitments are made in advance to provide a long term pricing signal for capacity resources 
the rpm is intended to provide a mechanism for pjm to meet the region s need for generation capacity  while allocating the cost to load serving entities through a locational reliability charge 

table of contents the following table summarizes the status of capacity sales for midwest generation and homer city at december  rpm capacity sold in base residual auction other capacity sales  net of purchases installed capacity mw unsold capacity mw capacity sold mw mw price per mw day mw average price per mw day aggregate average price per mw day january  to may  midwest generation homer city june  to may  midwest generation homer city june  to may  midwest generation homer city june  to may  midwest generation homer city capacity not sold arises from i capacity retained to meet forced outages under the rpm auction guidelines  and ii capacity that pjm does not purchase at the clearing price resulting from the rpm auction 
other capacity sales and purchases  net includes contracts executed in advance of the rpm base residual auction to hedge the price risk related to such auction  participation in rpm incremental auctions and other capacity transactions entered into to manage capacity risks 
the rpm auction capacity prices for the delivery period of june  to may  varied between different areas of pjm 
in the western portion of pjm  affecting midwest generation  the price of per mw day was substantially lower than previous capacity prices 
the decrease in forward capacity prices was attributable to a substantial increase in demand side management resources 
the impact of lower capacity prices for this period will have an adverse effect on midwest generation s revenues unless such lower capacity prices are offset by an unavailability of competing resources and increased energy prices  which is uncertain 
revenues from the sale of capacity from midwest generation and homer city beyond the periods set forth above will depend upon the amount of capacity available and future market prices either in pjm or nearby markets if eme has an opportunity to capture a higher value associated with those markets 
under pjm s rpm system  the market price for capacity is generally determined by aggregate market based supply conditions and an administratively set aggregate demand curve 
among the factors influencing the supply of capacity in any particular market are plant forced outage rates  plant closings  plant delistings due to plants being removed as capacity resources and or to export capacity to other markets  capacity imports from other markets  demand side management activities and the cost of new entry 

table of contents basis risk sales made from the fossil fueled facilities in the real time or day ahead market receive the actual spot prices or day ahead prices  as the case may be  at the busbars delivery points of the individual plants 
in order to mitigate price risk from changes in spot prices at the individual plant busbars  eme may enter into cash settled futures contracts as well as forward contracts with counterparties for energy to be delivered in future periods 
currently  a liquid market for entering into these contracts at the individual plant busbars does not exist 
a liquid market does exist for a settlement point at the pjm west hub in the case of the homer city facilities and for settlement points at the northern illinois hub and the aep dayton hub in the case of the midwest generation plants 
eme s hedging activities use these settlement points and  to a lesser extent  other similar trading hubs to enter into hedging contracts 
to the extent that  on the settlement date of a hedge contract  spot prices at the relevant busbar are lower than spot prices at the settlement point  the proceeds actually realized from the related hedge contract are effectively reduced by the difference 
this is referred to as basis risk 
during  transmission congestion in pjm has resulted in prices at the homer city busbar being lower than those at the pjm west hub by an average of  compared to during and during during  transmission congestion in pjm has resulted in prices at the individual busbars of the midwest generation plants being lower than those at the aep dayton hub and northern illinois hub by an average of and less than  respectively  compared to and  respectively  during by entering into cash settled futures contracts and forward contracts using the pjm west hub  the northern illinois hub  and the aep dayton hub or other similar trading hubs as settlement points  eme is exposed to basis risk as described above 
in order to mitigate basis risk  eme may purchase financial transmission rights and basis swaps in pjm for homer city and midwest generation 
a financial transmission right is a financial instrument that entitles the holder to receive the difference between actual spot prices for two delivery points in exchange for a fixed amount 
accordingly  eme s hedging activities include using financial transmission rights alone or in combination with forward contracts and basis swap contracts to manage basis risk 
coal and transportation price risk the midwest generation plants and homer city facilities purchase coal primarily obtained from the southern prb of wyoming and from mines located near the facilities in pennsylvania  respectively 

table of contents coal purchases are made under a variety of supply agreements 
the following table summarizes the amount of coal under contract at december  for the following three years amount of coal under contract in millions of equivalent tons midwest generation plants homer city facilities the amount of coal under contract in tons is calculated based on contracted tons and applying an  btu equivalent for the midwest generation plants and  btu equivalent for the homer city facilities

prices of napp coal  which are related to the price of coal purchased for the homer city facilities  decreased during from and increased substantially during from the price of napp coal with  btu per pound heat content and pounds of so per mmbtu sulfur content decreased to a price of per ton at december   compared to a price of per ton at january   as reported by the eia 
in  the price of napp coal ranged from per ton to per ton  as reported by the eia 
the decrease in napp coal prices was due in part to current global economic conditions that have lessened demand for coal  high levels of inventories and fuel switching 
in  the price of napp coal ranged from per ton to per ton  as reported by the eia 
in  the price of napp coal fluctuated between per ton to per ton  which was the price per ton at december   as reported by the eia 
prices of prb coal with  btu per pound heat content and pounds of so per mmbtu sulfur content purchased for the midwest generation plants declined during from year end prices and increased during from year end prices 
the price of prb coal fluctuated between per ton and per ton during  with a price of per ton at december   as reported by the eia 
the decrease in prb coal prices was due to lower demand and higher levels of inventory 
in  the price of prb coal fluctuated between per ton to per ton  with a price of per ton at january   as reported by the eia 
in  the price of prb coal ranged from per ton to per ton  which was the price per ton at december   as reported by the eia 
eme has contractual agreements for the transport of coal to its facilities 
the primary contract is with union pacific railroad and various short haul carriers  which extends through eme is exposed to price risk related to higher transportation rates after the expiration of its existing transportation contracts 
current transportation rates for prb coal 
table of contents are higher than the existing rates under contract transportation costs are approximately half of the delivered cost of prb coal to the midwest generation plants 
based on eme s anticipated coal requirements in in excess of the amount under contract  eme expects that a change in the price of coal at december  would increase or decrease pre tax income in by approximately million 
emission allowances price risk the federal acid rain program requires electric generating stations to hold so allowances sufficient to cover their annual emissions 
pursuant to pennsylvania s and illinois implementation of the cair  electric generating stations also are required to hold seasonal and annual nox allowances beginning january  as part of the acquisition of the fossil fueled facilities  eme obtained emission allowance rights that have been or are allocated to these plants 
eme purchases or sells emission allowances based on the amounts required for actual generation in excess of or less than the amounts allocated under these programs 
for further discussion of the cair  see item business environmental matters and regulations air quality nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide 
in the event that actual emissions required are greater than allowances held  eme is subject to price risk for purchases of emission allowances 
the market price for emission allowances may vary significantly 
the average purchase price of so allowances was per ton in  per ton in and per ton in the average purchase price of annual nox allowances was  per ton in based on broker s quotes and information from public sources  the spot price for so allowances and annual so allowances was per ton and per ton  respectively  at december  based on eme s anticipated annual and seasonal nox requirements for beyond those allowances already purchased  eme expects that a change in the price of annual and seasonal nox emission allowances at december  would increase or decrease pre tax income in by approximately million 
credit risk in conducting eme s hedging and trading activities  eme enters into transactions with utilities  energy companies  financial institutions  and other companies  collectively referred to as counterparties 
in the event a counterparty were to default on its trade obligation  eme would be exposed to the risk of possible loss associated with market price changes occurring since the original contract was executed if the nonperforming counterparty were unable to pay the resulting damages owed to eme 
further  eme would be exposed to the risk of non payment of accounts receivable accrued for products delivered prior to the time a counterparty defaulted 
to manage credit risk  eme evaluates the risk of potential defaults by counterparties 
credit risk is measured as the loss that eme would expect to incur if a counterparty failed to perform pursuant to the terms of its contractual obligations 
eme measures  monitors and mitigates credit risk to the extent possible 
to mitigate credit risk from counterparties  master netting agreements are used whenever possible and counterparties may be required to pledge 
table of contents collateral when deemed necessary 
eme also takes other appropriate steps to limit or lower credit exposure 
eme has established processes to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties 
eme manages the credit risk of its counterparties based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information  such as financial statements  regulatory filings  and press releases  to guide it in the process of setting credit levels  risk limits and contractual arrangements  including master netting agreements 
a risk management committee regularly reviews the credit quality of eme s counterparties 
despite this  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be wholly successful in mitigating credit risk or that collateral pledged will be adequate 
the credit risk exposure from counterparties of merchant energy hedging and trading activities is measured as the sum of net receivables accounts receivable less accounts payable and the current fair value of net derivative assets 
eme s subsidiaries enter into master agreements and other arrangements in conducting such activities which typically provide for a right of setoff in the event of bankruptcy or default by the counterparty 
at december   the balance sheet exposure as described above  broken down by the credit ratings of eme s counterparties  was as follows december  in millions exposure collateral net exposure credit rating a or higher a bbb bbb bbb below investment grade total eme assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty s s p or moody s rating 
for ease of reference  the above table uses the s p classifications to summarize risk  but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings 
exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchase and sales and non derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  except for any related accounts receivable 
the credit risk exposure set forth in the above table is comprised of million of net accounts receivable and payables and million representing the fair value of derivative contracts 
the exposure is based on master netting agreements with the related counterparties 
due to developments in the financial markets  credit ratings may not be reflective of the actual related credit risks 
in addition to the amounts set forth in the above table  eme s subsidiaries have posted a million cash margin in the aggregate with pjm  nyiso  miso  clearing brokers and other counterparties to support hedging and trading activities 
the margin posted to support these activities also exposes eme to credit risk of the related entities 

table of contents the majority of eme s consolidated wind projects and unconsolidated affiliates that own power plants sell power under power purchase agreements 
generally  each project or plant sells its output to one counterparty 
a default by the counterparty  including a default as a result of a bankruptcy  would likely have a material adverse effect on the operations of the project or plant 
coal for the fossil fueled facilities is purchased from suppliers under contracts which may be for multiple years 
a number of the coal suppliers to the fossil fueled facilities do not currently have an investment grade credit rating and  accordingly  eme may have limited recourse to collect damages in the event of default by a supplier 
eme seeks to mitigate this risk through diversification of its coal suppliers and through guarantees and other collateral arrangements when available 
despite this  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in mitigating credit risk from coal suppliers 
the fossil fueled facilities sell electric power generally into the pjm market by participating in pjm s capacity and energy markets or transact in capacity and energy on a bilateral basis 
sales into pjm accounted for approximately of eme s consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december  moody s rates pjm s debt aa pjm  an iso with over member companies  maintains its own credit risk policies and does not extend unsecured credit to non investment grade companies 
losses resulting from a pjm member default are shared by all other members using a predetermined formula 
at december   eme s account receivable due from pjm was million 
for the year ended december   a second customer  constellation energy commodities group  inc  accounted for of eme s consolidated operating revenues 
sales to constellation are primarily generated from the fossil fueled facilities and consist of energy sales under forward contracts 
the contract with constellation is guaranteed by constellation energy group  inc  which at december  had a senior unsecured debt rating of bbb by s p and baa by moody s 
at december   eme s account receivable due from constellation was million 
the terms of eme s wind turbine supply agreements contain significant obligations of the suppliers in the form of manufacturing and delivery of turbines  and payments for delays in delivery and for failure to meet performance obligations and warranty agreements 
eme s reliance on these contractual provisions is subject to credit risks 
generally  these are unsecured obligations of the turbine manufacturer 
a material adverse development with respect to eme s turbine suppliers may have a material impact on eme s wind projects and development efforts 
interest rate risk interest rate changes can affect earnings and the cost of capital for capital improvements or new investments in power projects 
emg mitigates the risk of interest rate fluctuations by arranging for fixed rate financing or variable rate financing with interest rate swaps  interest rate options or other hedging mechanisms for a number of its project financings 
the fair market values of long term fixed interest rate obligations are subject to interest rate risk 
the fair market value of emg s consolidated long term obligations including current portion was billion at december   compared to the carrying value of billion 
a increase in market interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in the fair value of total long term obligations by approximately million 
a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase in the fair value of total long term obligations by approximately million

critical accounting estimates and policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of edison international s consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or  the use of alternative estimates  that could have a material impact on edison international s results of operations or financial position 
for more information on edison international s accounting policies  see item edison international s notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
rate regulated enterprises nature of estimate required 
sce follows the accounting principles for rate regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service  plus a return on net investment  or rate base 
regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives 
due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue  these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates  conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred 
key assumptions and approach used 
sce s management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment  the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to sce or other rate regulated entities in california  
table of contents and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for rate making purposes 
using these factors  management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement 
this determination reflects the current regulatory climate in california and is subject to change in the future 
effect if different assumption used 
significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund  as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  all or part of the regulatory assets and liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings 
at december   the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of billion and regulatory liabilities of billion 
if different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition  sce s earnings and cash flows may vary from the amounts reported 
derivatives nature of estimates required 
management s judgment is required to determine if a transaction meets the definition of a derivative and  if it does  whether the normal sales and purchases exception applies or whether individual transactions qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
certain of edison international s long term power sales and fuel supply agreements related to its generation activities either do not meet the definition of a derivative  or qualify as normal purchases and sales and are  therefore  recorded on an accrual basis 
sce s fair value changes are expected to be recovered from or refunded to ratepayers  and therefore sce s fair value changes have no impact on earnings  but may temporarily affect cash flows 
sce has elected not to use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment 
eme uses derivative instruments for hedging activities and trading purposes 
derivative instruments are mainly utilized by eme to manage exposure to changes in electricity and fuel prices and interest rates 
derivative commodity instruments include forward sales transactions entered into on a bilateral basis with third parties  futures contracts  full requirements services contracts or load requirements services contracts  and capacity transactions 
financial derivative instruments include interest rate swaps entered into on a bilateral basis with counterparties 
eme follows authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging  which requires derivative instruments to be recorded at fair value unless an exception applies 
authoritative guidance also requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument  if any  is recognized currently in earnings 
eme records derivative instruments used for trading utilizing the fair value model 
eme s derivative instruments with a short term duration less than one year are normally valued 
table of contents using quoted market prices 
in the absence of quoted market prices  derivative instruments with a short term duration are valued considering the time value of money  volatility of the underlying commodity  and other factors as determined by eme 
resulting gains and losses are recognized in operating revenues on the accompanying consolidated income statements 
derivative assets include open derivative positions recorded at fair value  including cash flow hedges  that are in the money and the present value of net amounts receivable from structured transactions 
derivative liabilities include open derivative positions  including cash flow hedges  that are out of the money 
where eme enters into master agreements and other arrangements in conducting hedging and trading activities with a right of setoff in the event of bankruptcy or default by the counterparty  these types of transactions are reported net on the balance sheet 
key assumptions and approach used 
eme determines the fair value of its derivatives based on forward market prices in active markets adjusted for nonperformance risk 
if quoted market prices are not available  internally developed models are used to determine the fair value 
when actual market prices  or relevant observable inputs are not available  it is appropriate to use unobservable inputs which reflect management assumptions  including extrapolating limited short term observable data and developing correlations between liquid and non liquid trading hubs 
in assessing nonperformance risks  eme reviews credit ratings of counterparties and related default rates based on such credit ratings and prices of credit default swaps 
the market price or premium for credit default swaps represents the price that a counterparty would pay to transfer the risk of default  typically bankruptcy  to another party 
a credit default swap is not directly comparable to the credit risks of derivative contracts  but provides market information of the related risk of nonperformance 
in addition  a fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
for further information  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements 
effect if different assumptions used 
as described above  fair value is determined using a combination of market information or observable data and unobservable inputs which reflect management s assumptions 
changes in observable data would impact results 
in addition  unobservable inputs could have an impact on results 
fair value for level derivatives is derived using observable and unobservable inputs 
as of december   eme and sce level derivatives had a net fair value of million and million  respectively 
while it is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one input  if the fair value of eme and sce level derivatives were increased or decreased by  the impact would be a million and million increase or decrease to operating revenues  respectively 
for edison international s derivative instruments that are measured at fair value using quantitative pricing models  a significant change in estimate could affect edison international s results of operations 
for further sensitivities in edison international s assumptions used to calculate fair value  see emg results of operations fair value measurements and sce market risk exposures natural gas and electricity price risk

table of contents nuclear decommissioning aro nature of estimate required 
regulations by the nrc require sce to decommission its nuclear power plants which is expected to begin after the plants operating licenses expire 
in accordance with authoritative guidance  sce is required to record an obligation to decommission its nuclear facilities 
nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in utility rates through contributions that are reviewed every three years by the cpuc 
due to regulatory accounting treatment  nuclear decommissioning activities are not expected to affect sce earnings 
key assumptions and approach used 
the liability to decommission sce s nuclear power facilities is based on site specific studies performed in which estimate that sce will spend approximately billion through to decommission its active nuclear facilities 
decommissioning cost estimates are updated in each nuclear decommissioning triennial proceeding 
a site specific study was performed in which is currently awaiting cpuc approval 
once a cpuc decision is rendered the updated cost estimate is established and accreted over the lives of san onofre and palo verde 
the current estimate is based on the following assumptions from the site specific study decommissioning costs 
the estimated costs for labor  dismantling and disposal costs  energy and miscellaneous costs 
escalation rates 
annual escalation rates are used to convert the decommissioning cost estimates in base year dollars to decommissioning cost estimates in future year dollars 
escalation rates are primarily used for labor  material  equipment  and low level radioactive waste burial costs 
sce s current estimate is based on sce s decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes  escalated at rates ranging from to depending on the cost element annually 
timing 
cost estimates are based on an assumption that decommissioning will commence promptly after the current nrc operating licensees expire 
the operating licenses currently expire in for san onofre units and  and in  and for the palo verde units 
spent fuel dry storage costs 
cost estimates are based on an assumption that the doe will begin to take spent fuel in  and will remove the last spent fuel from the san onofre and palo verde sites by and  respectively 
costs for spent fuel monitoring are included until and  respectively 
changes in decommissioning technology  regulation  and economics 
the current cost studies assume the use of current technologies under current regulations and at current cost levels 
effect if different assumptions used 
the aro for decommissioning sce s active nuclear facilities was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
changes in the estimated costs or timing of decommissioning  or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates  could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission these facilities which could have a material affect on the recorded liability and related regulatory asset 
the following table illustrates the increase to 
table of contents the aro and regulatory asset if the escalation rate or discount rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant in millions increase to aro and regulatory asset at december  uniform increase in escalation rate of basis points decrease in discount rate of basis points pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions nature of estimate required 
authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet  the assets and or liabilities are normally offset through other comprehensive income loss 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for rate regulated enterprises  regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded instead of charges and credits to other comprehensive income loss for its postretirement benefit plans that are recoverable in utility rates 
edison international has a fiscal year end measurement date for all of its postretirement plans 
key assumptions of approach used 
pension and other postretirement obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and liability measurement 
additionally  health care cost trend rates are critical assumptions for postretirement health care plans 
these critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually 
other assumptions  which require management judgment  such as retirement  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience 
as of december   edison international s pension plans had a billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was million for as of december   edison international s pbop plans had a billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was million for the following are critical assumptions used 
table of contents to determine expense for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of december  in millions pension plans postretirement benefits other than pensions discount rate expected long term return on plan assets assumed health care cost trend rates the discount rate enables edison international to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
edison international selects its discount rate by performing a yield curve analysis 
this analysis determines the equivalent discount rate on projected cash flows  matching the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
two corporate yield curves were considered  citigroup and aon 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  current and expected asset allocations are considered  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
a portion of pbop trusts asset returns are subject to taxation  so the rate of return on plan assets above is determined on an after tax basis 
actual time weighted  annualized returns on the pension plan assets were  and for the one year  five year and ten year periods ended december   respectively 
actual time weighted  annualized returns on the pbop plan assets were   and over these same periods 
accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees 
the health care cost trend rate is for  gradually declining to for and beyond 
pension expense is recorded for sce based on the amount funded to the trusts  as calculated using an actuarial method required for rate making purposes  in which the impact of market volatility on plan assets is recognized in earnings on a more gradual basis 
any difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with rate making methods and pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for pension is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability  and will  over time  be recovered from or returned to customers 
as of december   this cumulative difference amounted to a regulatory asset of million  meaning that the accounting method has recognized million more in expense than the rate making method since implementation of authoritative guidance for employers accounting for pensions in edison international s pension and pbop plans are subject to limits established for federal tax deductibility 
sce funds its pension and pbop plans in accordance with amounts allowed by the cpuc 
executive pension plans and competitive power generation pbop plans have no plan assets 
effect if different assumptions used 
changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates  could have a material affect on the recorded expenses and liabilities 
edison international s total annual contributions for sce are recovered through cpuc approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be  at a minimum  equal to sce s total annual expense 

table of contents a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected benefit obligation for pension by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation for pension by million 
a one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would decrease the expense by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate for pbop would decrease the projected benefit obligation by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate for the pbop would increase the projected benefit obligation by million 
a one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pbop plan assets would decrease the expense by million 
increasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would increase the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  by million and annual aggregate service and interest costs by million 
decreasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would decrease the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  by million and annual aggregate service and interest costs by million 
income taxes nature of estimates required 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  edison international is required to estimate its income taxes for each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current period tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within edison international s consolidated balance sheet 
edison international takes certain tax positions it believes are applied in accordance with the applicable tax laws 
however  these tax positions are subject to interpretation by the irs  state tax authorities and the courts 
edison international determines its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
key assumptions and approach used 
accounting for tax obligations requires management judgment 
management uses judgment in determining whether the evidence indicates it is more likely than not  based solely on the technical merits  that a tax position will be sustained  and to determine the amount of tax benefits to be recognized 
judgment is also used in determining the likelihood a tax position will be settled and possible settlement outcomes 
in assessing its uncertain tax positions edison international considers  among others  the following factors the facts and circumstances of the position  regulations  rulings  and case law  opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers  and the experience gained from similar tax positions 
management evaluates uncertain tax positions at the end of each reporting period and makes adjustments when warranted based on changes in fact or law 
effect if different assumptions used 
actual income taxes may differ from the estimated amounts which could have a significant impact on the liabilities  revenue and expenses recorded in the financial statements 
edison international continues to be under audit or subject to audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular tax positions that involve interpretations of complex 
table of contents tax laws 
a tax liability has been recorded with respect to tax positions in which the outcome is uncertain and the effect is estimable 
such liabilities are based on judgment and a final determination could take many years from the time the liability is recorded 
furthermore  settlement of tax positions included in open tax years may be resolved by compromises of tax positions based on current factors and business considerations that may result in material adjustments to income taxes previously estimated 
see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes for a further discussion on income taxes 
impairment of long lived assets nature of estimates required 
eme evaluates its long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance 
the amount of the impairment charges  if applicable  are calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  which represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or  in the case of assets expected to be sold  at fair value less costs to sell 
authoritative guidance requires that if the undiscounted expected future cash flow from a company s assets or group of assets without interest charges is less than its carrying value  asset impairment must be recognized on the financial statements 
eme evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist or when eme commits to sell the asset 
these evaluations may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  as well as economic or operational analyses 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recorded 
key assumptions and approach used 
the assessment of impairment requires significant management judgment to determine if an indicator of impairment has occurred  how assets should be grouped  the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset s estimated useful life to determine if an impairment exists  and if an impairment exists  the fair value of the asset or asset group 
factors that eme considers important  which could trigger an impairment  include operating losses from a project  projected future operating losses  the financial condition of counterparties  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in estimating future prices of energy and capacity in wholesale energy markets and fuel prices that are susceptible to significant change  environmental and maintenance expenditures  and the time period due to the length of the estimated remaining useful lives 
effect if different assumptions used 
the estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the estimated fair value of an asset would change materially if different estimates and assumptions were used to determine the amounts or timing of future revenues  environmental compliance costs or operating expenditures 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  eme may be exposed to additional losses that could be material to eme s results of operations 

table of contents merchant coal fired power plants weak commodity prices and heightened public policy pressure on coal generation have resulted in continuing uncertainties for merchant coal fired power plants similar to eme s  which may require significant capital and increased operating costs to meet environmental requirements 
management has reviewed long term cash flow forecasts that included assumptions about future electricity and fuel prices  future capacity payments under the pjm rpm  and future capital expenditure requirements under different scenarios 
assumptions included in the long term cash flow forecasts included observable market prices for electricity and fuel to the extent available and long term prices developed based on a fundamental price model  long term capacity prices based on the assumption that the pjm rpm capacity market would continue consistent with its current structure  with expected increases in revenue as a result of declines in reserve margins beyond the price of the latest auctions  and multiple plans for compliance with environmental regulations 
if commodity prices do not increase consistent with the fundamental forecast or if eme decides not to install additional environmental control equipment and  instead  shuts down one or more coal fired power plants  the forecasted cash flow would be less than expected 
if the undiscounted expected cash flow measured at a plant level were less than the net book value of the asset group  an impairment charge would be recognized 
the amount of an impairment charge would be calculated as the excess of the net book value of the asset group over its fair value  which generally represents the discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group 
if eme decides to implement an environmental compliance plan that results in shutting down one or more coal fired power plants or results in a shorter useful life  in addition to preparing an impairment analysis and possibly recording a related impairment of the plant  the remaining useful life of the plant would need to be adjusted to reflect the revised shorter life 
the impact on annual depreciation could be significant 
eme includes allocated acquired emission allowances as part of each power plant asset group 
in the case of the powerton and joliet stations  eme also includes prepaid rent in the respective asset group 
eme s unit of account is at the plant level and  accordingly  the closure of a unit at a multi unit site would not result in an impairment of property  plant and equipment unless such condition were to affect an impairment assessment on the entire plant 
accounting for contingencies  guarantees and indemnities nature of estimates required 
edison international records loss contingencies when it determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a guarantee or indemnification subject to authoritative guidance is entered into  edison international records a liability for the estimated fair value of the underlying guarantee or indemnification 
gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized 

table of contents key assumptions and approach used 
the determination of a reserve for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter  including the analysis of different scenarios 
liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change
