competition the market for primary aluminum is global  and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region 
we compete with us and international companies in the aluminum industry primarily in the areas of price  quality and service 
in addition  aluminum competes with materials such as steel  copper  carbon fiber  composites  plastic and glass  which may be substituted for aluminum in certain applications 

table of contents our hawesville plant is located adjacent to its largest customer 
this location allows hawesville to deliver a portion of their production in molten form  at a cost savings to both parties  providing a competitive advantage over other potential suppliers 
we believe that hawesville also has a competitive advantage in that it currently is the largest producer of high purity aluminum in north america 
customer base in  we derived approximately of our consolidated sales from our three major customers southwire company southwire  glencore international ag together with its subsidiaries  glencore and bhp billiton 
additional information about the revenues and percentage of sales to these major customers is available in note business segments of the consolidated financial statements included herein

it has been our experience that discussions past the contract expiration are not unusual in iceland 
the plant has continued to operate normally during these extended negotiations 
see item a  risk factors union disputes could raise our production cost or impair our production operations 
pricing our operating results are highly sensitive to changes in the price of primary aluminum  power and the raw materials used in its production 
as a result  we try to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in primary aluminum  power and raw material prices through the use of various fixed price commitments and financial instruments 
generally  we price our products at an indexed or market price  in which the customer pays an agreed upon premium over the lme price or other market indices 
grundartangi derives substantially all of its revenues from tolling arrangements whereby it converts alumina provided by its customers into primary aluminum for a fee based on the lme price for primary aluminum 
grundartangi s revenues are subject to market price risk associated with the lme price for primary aluminum  however  because grundartangi tolls alumina for its customers it is not exposed to fluctuations in the price of alumina 
grundartangi s tolling revenues include a premium based on the eu import duty for primary aluminum

the facility is located adjacent to the ohio river near ravenswood  west virginia 
in february  we conducted an orderly curtailment of the plant operations at ravenswood 
layoffs for the majority of ravenswood s employees were completed by february  we expect that ravenswood s operations will remain curtailed until economic conditions warrant restarting 
such conditions would include an enabling power and labor contracts and a sustainable and suitably priced lme environment metal sales agreements 
prior to the ravenswood curtailment in february  we sold  metric tons per year of primary aluminum produced at ravenswood under the glencore metal agreement 
following the ravenswood curtailment  we assigned ravenswood production requirements under this contract to mt 
holly and hawesville 
however  curtailing operations at ravenswood does not relieve us of our contractual obligations 
we may continue to incur costs under these contracts to meet our contractual obligations  including potentially securing other aluminum to satisfy our obligations to glencore

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following describes certain of the risks and uncertainties we face that could cause our future results to differ materially from our current results and from those anticipated in our forward looking statements 
these risk factors should be considered together with the other risks and uncertainties described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere herein 
this list of significant risk factors is not all inclusive or necessarily in order of importance 
we face substantial risks relating to our operational restructuring and our failure to successfully implement such plan could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our operational restructuring plan entails previous and possible additional capacity curtailment at our facilities  the renegotiation of long term commercial contracts  the reduction of other operating costs  the reduction of capital expenditures  the possible financing of our helguvik facility and potential asset sales  among other things 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we face several risks related to the implementation of the operational restructuring  including our ability to successfully complete these actions as planned and to continue to successfully operate our business following such restructuring 
in addition  we may be exposed to liabilities as a result of our operational restructuring 
for additio nal risks relating to the operational restructuring  see construction at our helguvik smelter site is under review 
substantial delay in the completion of this project may increase its cost and impose other risks to completion that are not foreseeable today  a majority of our aluminum sales at hawesville are subject to contracts which limit our ability to curtail capacity and create dependence on a major customer  we would be required to incur substantial costs in order to curtail unprofitable aluminum production  changes or disruptions to our current alumina and other raw material supply arrangements could increase our raw material costs  certain of our contracts for raw materials  including certain contracts for alumina and electricity  require us to take or pay for fixed quantities of such materials  even if we curtail unprofitable production capacity and union disputes could r aise our production costs or impair our production operations 
as a result of the above  we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in implementing the operational restructuring as planned or receive the benefits we are seeking from its implementation 
in connection with our operational restructuring  whether as a consequence of its actual implementation or the difficulty in realizing the intended benefits of the operational restructuring  we may have to seek bankruptcy protection for some or all of our us subsidiaries and or may be forced to divest some or all of our us subsidiaries 
if we were to seek bankruptcy protection for these subsidiaries  we would face additional risks 
such action could cause concern among our customers and suppliers generally  distract our management and our other employees and subject us to increased risks of lawsuits 
other negative consequences could include negative publicity  which could have a material negative impact on the trading price of our securities and negatively affect our ability to raise capital in the f uture 
the failure to successfully implement the operational restructuring or to achieve its intended benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
even if we successfully complete the operational restructuring  factors beyond our control  such as lme prices  global supply and demand for aluminum and our competitive position  among others  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
a continuation or worsening of global financial and economic conditions could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
following the global financial and credit market disruptions in and  we have experienced a reduction in the availability of liquidity and credit generally 
the general slowdown in economic activity caused by the domestic recession and difficult international financial and economic conditions continues to adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity as the demand for primary aluminum has been reduced and the price of our products has fallen 
a continuation or worsening of the current financial and economic conditions could adversely affect our customers ability to meet the terms of sale and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents our ability to access the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms to obtain funding for our operations and capital projects may be limited due to our credit ratings  our financial condition or the deterioration of these markets 
our revolving credit facility will mature in september in addition  our availability under our revolving credit facility has been negatively impacted by the curtailment of production capacity at ravenswood and the partial curtailment of production capacity at hawesville  which have reduced the amount of our domestic accounts receivable and inventory 
further curtailments of production capacity would incrementally reduce domestic accounts receivable and inventory  further reducing availability under our revolving credit facility 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the lenders under our revolving credit facility have the ability to modify the reserve criteria in the facility  which could further reduce our borrowing base 
as a result  liquidity available to us under the revolving credit facility could be reduced 
in addition  the holders of the approximately million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes that remain outstanding have an option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of these securities at par in august and to require us to settle in cash at market prices up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes upon conversion  which may occur at any time 
each of these events would increase our liquidity needs 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
provisions in our charter documents and state law may make it difficult for others to obtain control of century aluminum  even though some stockholders may consider them to be beneficial 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws and our tax benefit preservation plan  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law  may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of century  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise have received a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices 
for example  these provisions give authority to our board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without any stockholder vote  provide for a board of directors consisting of three classes  each of which serves for a different three year term  require stockholders to give advance notice prior to submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings or to nominate persons for election as directors  and restrict certain business combinations between us and any person who beneficially owns or more of our outstanding voting stock 
our tax benefit preservation plan would also cause substantial dilution to any person or group who attempts to acquire a significant interest in us without advance approval from our board of directors 
while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors  they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some  or a majority  of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and  in that case  may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 
our relationship with glencore may also deter a takeover 
as of december   we believe that glencore beneficially owned  through its common stock  approximately of our issued and outstanding common stock and  through its ownership of common and preferred stock  an overall economic ownership of century

table of contents declines in aluminum prices have adversely affected our financial position and results of operations  and further declines or an increase in our operating costs could result in further curtailment of operations at one or more of our facilities if alternate sources of liquidity are not available 
the price of primary aluminum is frequently volatile and fluctuates in response to general economic conditions  expectations for supply and demand growth or contraction and the level of global inventories 
the crisis in financial and credit markets has led to a pronounced downturn in global economic activity  which is expected to be long in duration 
the global market for commodities has deteriorated in line with the decline in the global economy 
declining demand for aluminum products in developed and developing nations  increasing stocks on the lme and a general lack of confidence in future economic conditions combined in late and to produce an unprecedented decline in the lme price for aluminum 
the lme price for primary aluminum fell from its high on july   per metric ton  to a low of  per metric ton on february   before rising to  per metric ton on march  this represents one of the most substantial and rapid declines in the history of recorded lme prices 
the decline in aluminum prices in and adversely impacted our operations  particularly in our us facilities  since our operating costs did not fall to the degree that aluminum prices dropped 
any decline in aluminum prices adversely affects our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
sustained depressed prices for aluminum would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
if the price we realize for our products falls below our cost of production  we will have to rely on other sources of liquidity  identify additional cash reductions or further curtail operations to fund our operations 
potential other sources of liquidity could include additional issuances of equity  equity linked securities  debt issuances  prepaid aluminum sales  asset sales and sales of minority interests in our operations 
any future equity or equity linked security issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders  and any future debt incurrence would increase our leverage and interest expense and would likely contain restrictive covenants 
we cannot provide assurance that any of these financing alternatives will be available or  if available  that they would be successfully completed 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure the required alternative sources of liquidity to fund our operations or to take actions necessary to curtail additional operations  if these steps are required 
we could require substantial resources to fund our capital expenditures if we are unable to generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures and other obligations  our ability to continue to meet these cash requirements in the future could  depending upon the future price of aluminum over which we have no control and our future capital programs  require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds  including from capital and credit markets 
changes in global economic conditions  including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity  and the success of plans to manage costs  inventory and other important elements of our business  may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations 
if  among other factors  primary aluminum prices were to decline  our costs are higher than contemplated  we suffer unexpected production outages  or icelandic laws change and either increase our tax obligations or limit our access to cash flow from our icelandic operations  we would need to identify additional sources of liquidity 
during and  credit market conditions made and could continue to make  it difficult to obtain new funding from the credit and capital markets for our operating and capital needs 
although credit availability has improved  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased significantly  while the availability of funds from those markets has diminished 
also  as a result of concern about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining funding from the credit markets has increased significantly as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
in addition  our credit ratings were downgraded in  and further negative actions the credit agencies may take could negatively affect our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future and could lead to worsened trade terms  increasing our liquidity needs 
an inability to access capital and credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents in light of the global economic climate  we continue to review our future capital plans and have reduced  deferred or halted most non critical capital expenditures at our existing smelters and have reduced capital expenditures at our helguvik project 
see construction at our helguvik smelter site is under review 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unacceptable terms  we may be unable to respond to competitive pressures or fund operations  capital expenditure or other obligations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by reductions in our capital expenditures and other responses to unfavorable economic conditions 
in response to the global economic downturn and related disruptions in the financial markets  in recent times we have curtailed significant production capacity and greatly reduced capital expenditures  including development of our helguvik smelter 
if demand for aluminum improves  our ability to take advantage of improved market conditions may be constrained by these earlier curtailments  capital expenditure restrictions and other similar actions  and the long term value of our business could be adversely impacted 
our position in relation to our competitors may also deteriorate 
we may also be required to address commercial and political issues in relation to our reductions in capital expenditures or operational curtailme nt in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
future declines in the financial markets and or our curtailment actions could have significant and adverse effects on our pension funding obligations 
we maintain two qualified defined benefit plans  and contribute to a third  on behalf of our employees 
as a result of poor investment returns due to the global financial crisis  the benefit plans we maintain were underfunded as of december  if capital markets experience further significant losses  pension fund balances would remain reduced and additional cash contributions to the pension funds could be required 
additionally  as a result of our curtailment actions  we may be required to make additional significant contributions to the pension funds earlier than anticipated 
international operations expose us to political  regulatory  currency and other related risks 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations 
international operations expose us to risks  including unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations  political and economic instability  challenges in managing foreign operations  increased cost to adapt our systems and practices to those used in foreign countries  export duties  tariffs and other trade barriers  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
for example  recent changes in icelandic tax law and agreements with the icelandic ministers of finance and industry will significantly increase our icelandic tax liabilities in through changes in foreign laws and regulations are generally beyond our ability to control  influence or predict and further adverse changes in these laws in th e future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  we may be exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and  as a result  an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could increase our operating expenses which are denominated and payable in those currencies 
as we continue to explore other opportunities outside the us  including the helguvik facility  our currency risk with respect to the isk and other foreign currencies will significantly increase 

table of contents if economic and political conditions in iceland continue to deteriorate  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
iceland is important to our business 
recent turmoil in iceland s financial and political systems has created concern for the stability of iceland s financial markets and made cash management activities in iceland more challenging 
for example  the icelandic government and the central bank of iceland are restricting the free transfer of funds outside of iceland and  specifically  foreign currency within and outside of iceland 
by letter dated january   we were notified that our icelandic operations are exempt from these foreign currency rules 
however  we cannot control further actions by the central bank of iceland  which might restrict our ability to transfer funds through the icelandic banking system and outside of iceland 
while we currently maintain essentially all of our icelandi c operating funds in accounts outside of iceland  and are receiving substantially all of our customer payments in such accounts  a portion of our funds remain in the icelandic banks to meet local working capital requirements 
in addition  as payables become due in iceland  we must transfer funds through the icelandic banking system 
if economic and financial conditions in iceland deteriorate  or if counterparties and lenders become unwilling to engage in normal banking relations with and within iceland  our ability to pay vendors  process payroll and receive payments could be adversely impacted 
in addition  the collapse of the icelandic banking system  combined with other factors  has resulted in a significant deterioration in the general economic conditions in the country 
while our business in iceland is currently operating without significant difficulties  further impacts  if any  of these developments are uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time 
construction at our helguvik smelter site is under review 
substantial delay in the completion of this project may increase its cost and impose other risks to completion that are not foreseeable today 
nordural helguvik ehf is currently evaluating the helguvik project s cost  scope and schedule in light of the global economic crisis and current commodity prices 
during this evaluation process  nordural helguvik ehf has redesigned the scope of this project into four  mt phases and significantly reduced spending on the project 
nordural helguvik ehf cannot be certain when or if it will restart major construction and engineering activities or ultimately complete the helguvik project or  if completed  that the helguvik smelter would operate in a profitable manner 
we will not realize any return on our significant investment in the helguvik project until we are able to commence helguvik operations in a profitable manner 
if we fail to achieve operations  we may have to recognize a loss on our investment  which would have an adve rse impact on our future earnings 
if nordural helguvik ehf decides to proceed with the helguvik project  this project is subject to various contractual approvals and conditions 
many of the contractual arrangements related to the helguvik project have time periods for performance 
the delay in restoring major construction and completing the helguvik project has caused nordural helguvik ehf to renegotiate and extend  or undertake to renegotiate and extend  existing contractual commitments  including with respect to power  transmission  technology and raw materials 
there can be no assurance that the contractual approvals and conditions  including extensions  necessary to proceed with construction of the helguvik smelter will be obtained or satisfied on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  such approvals or extensions as are received ma y be subject to conditions that are unfavorable or make the project impracticable or less attractive from a financial standpoint 
even if we receive the necessary approvals and extensions on terms that we determine are acceptable  the construction of this project is a complex undertaking 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the project within our projected budget and schedule 
to successfully execute this project  we will also need to arrange additional financing and either enter into tolling arrangements or secure a supply of alumina 
in addition  unforeseen technical difficulties could increase the cost of the project  delay the project or render the project not feasible 
any delay in the completion of the project or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures from future capital raising  available cash and cash flow from operations 
we may be unable to raise additional capital  or do so on attractive terms  due to a number of factors including a lack of demand  poor economic conditions  unfavorable interest rates or our financial condition or credit rating at the time 
if additional capital resources are unavailable  we may further curtail construction and development activities 

table of contents if we are unable to procure a reliable source of power  the helguvik project will not be feasible 
the helguvik project will require generation and transmission of a substantial amount of electricity to power the smelter 
our indirect  wholly owned iceland subsidiary  nordural helguvik ehf  has entered into agreements with two providers of geothermal power in iceland for a substantial portion of this power 
these two power agreements are subject to certain conditions for each stage of delivery of power 
these conditions include approvals by the boards of directors of the power companies  as well as environmental agency approvals for the power producing assets 
given the uncertainty surrounding power generation  there may be a delay in the completion of the necessary power infrastructure to serve the helguvik project 
in addition  generation of the electrical power contracted for the helguvik smelter will require successful development of new geothermal energy sources within designated areas in iceland 
if there are construction delays or technical difficulties in developing these new geothermal fields  power may be delayed or may not be available 
development of the generation and transmission infrastructure is expensive and requires significant resources from the power and transmission providers 
factors which could delay or impede the generation and delivery of electric power are substantially beyond our ability to control  influence or predict  including the power providers ability to finance the development of new geothermal energy sources 
in addition  we and the power providers have agreed to extend the time periods for satisfying certain of the conditions relating to the power commitment due to delays in construction of the helguvik project and the power plants resulting from the financial crisis in and there can be no assurance that we and the power providers will continue to extend the time periods for satisfaction of these conditions 
if we are unable to continue to agree with the power providers to extend the time periods for satisfaction of these conditions to coincide with the resumption of major construction activities or operation of the smelter  we may have to commit to purchase power prior to our preferred time period  risk losing the power commitments or become subject to other unforeseen risks relating thereto 
in october  nordural helguvik ehf signed a transmission agreement with landsnet to provide an electrical power transmission system to the helguvik smelter 
if nordural helguvik ehf is unable to proceed with the project  it may have to reimburse landsnet for certain significant expenditures under the transmission agreement 
any reduction in the duty on primary aluminum imports into the european union decreases our revenues at grundartangi 
certain of grundartangi s tolling agreements include a premium based on the eu import duty for primary aluminum 
in may  the eu members reduced the import duty for primary aluminum to three percent and agreed to review the new duty after three years 
this decrease in the eu import duty for primary aluminum has adversely impacted our revenues from grundartangi  and further decreases would also have an adverse impact on our revenues 
a majority of our aluminum sales at hawesville are subject to contracts which limit our ability to curtail capacity and create dependence on a major customer 
our primary aluminum supply agreement with southwire will expire in march approximately of our consolidated net sales for were derived from sales to southwire 
we may be unable to extend or replace our contract with southwire when it terminates 
due to southwire s proximity to hawesville  we are able to deliver molten aluminum to southwire  thereby eliminating our casting and reducing our sales and marketing costs 
our contract with southwire obligates us to deliver quantities of molten aluminum  which limits our ability to cut costs by curtailing operations 
curtailing operations at this facility would not relieve us of our contractual obligations 
if we are unable to renew this contract on satisfactory terms when it expires or if southwire significantly reduces its purchases under this contract  we would incur higher casting and shipping costs and potentially higher sales and marketing costs 

table of contents we could be required to incur substantial costs in order to curtail unprofitable aluminum production 
curtailing unprofitable production to reduce our operating costs requires us to incur substantial expense  both at the time of the curtailment and on an ongoing basis 
our facilities are subject to contractual and other fixed costs that continue even if we curtail operations at these facilities 
these costs reduce the cost saving advantages of curtailing unprofitable aluminum production 
in addition  the prospect of these costs and our joint ownership of certain of our operations limit our flexibility to curtail all of our unprofitable production 
losses caused by disruptions in the supply of power would adversely affect our operations 
we use large amounts of electricity to produce primary aluminum 
any loss of power which reduces the amperage to our equipment or causes an equipment shutdown would result in a reduction in the volume of molten aluminum produced  and sudden losses of power may result in the hardening or freezing of molten aluminum in the pots where it is produced 
interruptions in the supply of electrical power to our facilities can be caused by a number of circumstances  including unusually high demand  blackouts  equipment or transformer failure  human error  natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
if such a condition were to occur  we may lose production for a prolonged period of time and incur significant losses 
we operate our plants at close to peak amperage 
accordingly  even partial failures of transformers  such as ou r recent issues at grundartangi  will affect our production 
for example  we expect the repair at grundartangi will result in a loss of production of approximately  mt 
we maintain property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events  but are required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those insurance policies 
in addition  the coverage under those policies may not be sufficient to cover all losses  or may not cover certain events 
certain of our insurance policies do not cover any losses that may be incurred if our suppliers are unable to provide power during periods of unusually high demand 
certain losses or prolonged interruptions in our operations may trigger a default under our revolving credit facility 
changes or disruptions to our current alumina  other raw material supply and electricity arrangements could increase our production costs even if we curtail unprofitable production capacity 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for alumina 
disruptions to our supply of alumina could occur for a variety of reasons  including disruptions of production at a particular supplier s alumina refinery 
these disruptions may require us to purchase alumina on the spot market on less favorable terms than under our current agreements 
because we sell our products based on the lme price for primary aluminum  we will not be able to pass on these increased costs to our customers 
our business also depends upon the adequate supply of other raw materials  including aluminum fluoride  calcined petroleum coke  pitch  finished carbon anodes and cathodes  at competitive prices 
although there remain multiple sources for these raw materials worldwide  consolidation among suppliers has g lobally reduced the number of available suppliers in this industry 
a disruption in our raw materials supply from our existing suppliers due to a labor dispute  shortage of their raw materials  curtailment of operations or other unforeseen factors may affect our operating results if we are unable to secure alternate supplies of these materials at comparable prices 
in addition  we have obligations under certain contracts to take or pay for specified quantities of alumina and electricity over the term of those contracts  regardless of our operating requirements 
therefore  our financial position and results of operations may be affected by the market price for electric power  even if we curtail unprofitable production capacity because we will continue to incur costs under these contracts to meet or settle our contractual obligations 
if we are unable to use such raw materials in our operations or sell them at prices consistent with or greater than our contract costs  we could incur significant losses under these contracts 
in addition  these commitments may also limit our ability to take advantage of favorable changes in the market prices for primary aluminum or raw mater ials and may have a material adverse effect our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents electricity represents our single largest operating cost 
as a result  the availability of electricity at economic prices is critical to the profitability of our operations 
portions of the contracted cost of the electricity supplied to mt 
holly and all of hawesville s electricity costs vary with the supplier s costs 
an increase in these costs would increase the price these facilities pay for electricity 
costs under the mt 
holly electricity contract have substantially increased in recent years with rising fuel prices 
as these contracts have take or pay type provisions  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of hawesville and mt 
holly may be affected by the price for electric power even if we curtail unprofitable production capacity 
significant increases in electricity costs a t any of our operations may have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we may be required to write down the book value of certain assets 
we are required to perform various analyses related to the carrying value of various tangible and intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that their net carrying amount may not be recoverable 
given the recent lack of profitability of certain of our production facilities and recent global economic conditions  which in part drive assumptions for the future in such analyses  we could have significant adjustments in the carrying value for certain assets 
for example  in our results for the quarter ended december   we determined that an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of a portion of our long lived assets was not currently required under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc formerly statement of f inancial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the future  we will continue to evaluate our tangible and intangible assets for impairments and valuation allowance  which could be significant 
any such adjustments would be in the form of a non cash charge which would reduce our earnings and reduce our balance of retained earnings 
the cyclical nature of the aluminum industry causes variability in our earnings and cash flows 
our operating results depend on the market for primary aluminum  which is a highly cyclical commodity with prices that are affected by global demand and supply factors and other conditions 
historically  aluminum prices have been volatile  and we expect such volatility to continue 
during and  we experienced unfavorable global economic conditions and a decline in worldwide demand for primary aluminum 
declines in primary aluminum prices reduce our earnings and cash flows 
a further downturn in aluminum prices may significantly reduce the amount of cash available to meet our obligations and fund our long term business strategies 
union disputes could raise our production costs or impair our production operations 
the bargaining unit employees at hawesville and ravenswood are represented by the uswa 
century s uswa labor contracts at hawesville and ravenswood expire in march and august  respectively 
our bargaining unit employees at grundartangi are represented by five unions under a collective bargaining agreement that expired on december  if we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with any labor union representing our employees  our labor contracts may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at any of these facilities in the future 
any threatened or actual work stoppage in the future or inability to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements could prevent or significantly impair our ability to conduct production operations at our unionized facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial co ndition  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents climate change  climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations 
climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are the subject of significant attention in the countries in which we operate and a number of governments or governmental bodies in these countries have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change 
for example  as a member of the european economic area and a signatory to the kyoto protocol  iceland has implemented legislation to abide by the kyoto protocol and prepare to abide by directive ec of the european parliament which establishes a cap and trade scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading 
because iceland was granted emissions allowances under the kyoto protocol through  iceland has not yet implemented directive ec  but it is anticipated that iceland will b egin complying with the directive in in addition  we are aware of potential us legislation that if enacted  among other things  would implement a cap and trade system of allowances and credits in the united states 
implementation of these potential regulatory changes or others is uncertain and may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact our operations directly or indirectly through customers or our supply chain 
as a result of the foregoing  we may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with such regulatory changes  increased energy costs  costs to purchase or profits from sales of  allowances or credits under a cap and trade system  increased insurance premiums and deductibles  a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly  from changes in costs of goods sold 
in addition  the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncert ain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances 
these may include changes in rainfall patterns  shortages of water or other natural resources  changing sea levels  changing storm patterns and intensities  and changing temperature levels 
any adverse regulatory and physical changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that could result in costs or liabilities 
we are obligated to comply with various federal  state and other environmental laws and regulations  including the environmental laws and regulations of the united states  iceland and the eu 
environmental laws and regulations may expose us to costs or liabilities relating to our manufacturing operations or property ownership 
we incur operating costs and capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  we are currently and may in the future be responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former facilities or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources 
if more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed  previously unknown environmental conditions or damages to natural resour ces are discovered or alleged  or if contributions from other responsible parties with respect to sites for which we have cleanup responsibilities are not available  we may be subject to additional liability  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
further  additional environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known  with respect to sites previously owned or operated by us  by related corporate entities or by our predecessors  or at sites that we may acquire in the future 
in addition  overall production costs may become prohibitively expensive and prevent us from effectively competing in price sensitive markets if future capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance or cleanup are significantly greater than current or projected expenditures and costs 

table of contents acquisitions may present difficulties 
we have a history of making acquisitions and we expect to make acquisitions in the future based on several factors  including whether primary aluminum prices in the global market improve 
we are subject to numerous risks as a result of our acquisition strategy  including the following we may spend time and money pursuing target acquisitions that do not close  acquired companies may have contingent or unidentified liabilities  it may be challenging for us to manage our existing business as we integrate acquired operations  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  and management of acquisitions will require continued development of financial controls and information systems  which may prove to be expensive  time consuming and difficult to maintain 
accordingly  our past or future acquisitions might not ultimately improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated 
we require significant cash flow to meet our debt service requirements  which increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  reduces cash available for other purposes and limits our operational flexibility 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of outstanding debt 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
the level of our debt could have important consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  reducing cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  working capital and other general corporate purposes  because a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to servicing our debt  and limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  competitive and other changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 
we have various obligations to make payments in cash that will reduce the amount of cash available to make interest payments required on our outstanding debt and for other uses 
holders of our notes have the right to convert their notes at any time  which would require us to deliver cash up to the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted 
in addition  in august  the holders of our notes have an option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of these securities at par 
our industrial revenue bonds irbs and any future borrowings on our credit facility are at variable interest rates  and future borrowings required to fund working capital at grundartangi or the construction of the helguvik facility may be at variable rates 
an increase in interest rates would increase o ur debt service obligations under these instruments  further limiting cash flow available for other uses 
in addition to our debt  we have liabilities and other obligations which could reduce cash available for other purposes and could limit our operational flexibility 

table of contents our ability to pay interest on and to repay or refinance our debt  and to satisfy other commitments  will depend upon our future operating performance  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors  including market prices for primary aluminum  that are beyond our control  as well as our access to additional sources of liquidity 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay debt service obligations  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other liquidity needs  we could attempt to restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity or debt capital 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to accomplish those actions on satisfactory terms or at all and if we are unable to ultimately meet our debt service obligations and fund our other liquidity needs it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
despite our substantial level of debt  we may incur more debt  which could exacerbate any or all of the risks described above 
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
although the loan and security agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior secured notes due the notes limits our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and  under certain circumstances  debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
for example  as of december   approximately million would be available to us for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  the loan and security agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes do not prevent us from incurring certain obligat ions that do not constitute debt 
to the extent that we incur additional debt or such other obligations  the risks associated with our substantial debt described above  including our possible inability to service our debt  would increase 
our debt instruments subject us to covenants and restrictions our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes each contain various covenants that restrict the way we conduct our business and limit our ability to incur debt  pay dividends and engage in transactions such as acquisitions and investments  among other things  which may impair our ability to obtain additional liquidity and grow our business 
any failure to comply with those covenants would likely constitute a breach under the revolving credit facility or the indenture governing the notes  which may result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our outstanding indebtedness and termination of commitments under our revolving credit facility 
if our indebtedness is accelerated  we may be unable to repay the required amounts and our secured lenders could foreclose on any collateral secu ring our secured debt 
further consolidation within the metals industry could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 
the metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be more consolidation transactions in the future 
consolidation by our competitors may enhance their capacity and their access to resources  lower their cost structure and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
continued consolidation may limit our ability to implement our strategic objectives effectively 
we cannot reliably predict the impact on us of further consolidation in the metals industry 

table of contents we depend upon intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations 
we are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon the receipt of intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries 
subject to the restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes  future borrowings by our subsidiaries could contain restrictions or prohibitions on intercompany transfers by those subsidiaries 
in addition  under applicable law  our subsidiaries could be limited in the amounts that they are permitted to pay as dividends on their capital stock 
for example  the icelandic government and the central bank of iceland are restricting the free transfer of funds outside of iceland 
in furtherance of this  on november   the central bank of iceland adopted rules regarding th e movement of foreign currency within and outside of iceland 
the rules are broad and impose many restrictions on the movement of foreign currencies outside of iceland 
in january  we were notified that our icelandic operations are exempt from these foreign currency rules 
however  we cannot control further actions by the central bank of iceland  which might restrict our ability to transfer funds through the icelandic banking system and outside of iceland 
our ability to utilize certain net operating losses  tax credits and other tax assets to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change under the internal revenue code 
as of december   we had net operating losses  tax credits and other tax assets of approximately  after adjusting for losses carried back to previous tax years  which could offset future taxable income 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experiences an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in general  an ownership change would occur if our five percent shareholders  as defined under the code  collectively increase their ownership in us by more than percentage points over a rolling three year period 
in september  we adopted a tax benefits preservation plan 
the tax benefits preservation plan is subject to shareholders approval at our annual meeting 
the purpose of the plan is to minimize the likelihood of an ownership change occurring for section purposes 
despite adoption of the tax benefits preservation plan  future transactions in our stock that may not be in our control may cause us to experience an ownership change and thus limit our ability to utilize net operating losses  tax credits and other tax assets to offset future taxable income
