overview we operate in the truckload and logistics sectors of the transportation industry 
in the truckload sector  we focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that generally ship more consistently throughout the year 
in the logistics sector  besides managing transportation requirements for individual customers  we provide additional sources of truck capacity  alternative modes of transportation  a global delivery network and systems analysis to optimize transportation needs 
our success depends on our ability to efficiently manage our resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to our customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
our ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is essential to efficiently deploy resources and make capital investments in tractors and trailers with respect to our truckload segment or obtain qualified third party capacity at a reasonable price with respect to our vas segment 
although our business volume is not highly concentrated  we may also be affected by our customers financial failures or loss of customer business 
operating revenues reported in our operating statistics table under results of operations are categorized as i trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  ii trucking fuel surcharge revenues  iii non trucking revenues  including vas  and iv other operating revenues 
trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  and trucking fuel surcharge revenues are generated by the six operating fleets in the truckload segment dedicated  regional  van  expedited  temperature controlled and flatbed 
non trucking revenues  including vas  are generated primarily by the four operating units in our vas segment brokerage  freight management  intermodal and international  and a small amount is generated by the truckload segment 
other operating revenues are generated from other business activities such as third party equipment maintenance and equipment leasing 
in  trucking net of fuel surcharge and trucking fuel surcharge revenues accounted for of total operating revenues  and non trucking and other operating revenues accounted for of total operating revenues 
trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  are typically generated on a per mile basis and also include revenues such as stop charges  loading unloading charges and equipment detention charges 
because fuel surcharge revenues fluctuate in response to changes in fuel costs  we identify them separately in the operating statistics table and exclude them from the statistical calculations to provide a more meaningful comparison between periods 
the key statistics used to evaluate trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  are i average revenues per tractor per week  ii average revenues per mile total and loaded  iii average annual miles per tractor  iv average percentage of empty miles miles without trailer cargo  v average trip length in loaded miles and vi average number of tractors in service 
general economic conditions  seasonal trucking industry freight patterns and industry capacity are important factors that impact these statistics 
our truckload segment also generates a small amount of revenues categorized as non trucking revenues  related to shipments delivered to or from mexico where the truckload segment utilizes a third party capacity provider 
we exclude such revenues from the statistical calculations 
our most significant resource requirements are company drivers  owner operators  tractors  trailers and equipment operating costs such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance and supplies and maintenance 
to mitigate our risk to fuel price increases  we recover from our customers additional fuel surcharges that generally recoup a majority of the increased fuel costs  however  we cannot assure that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
our financial results are also affected by company driver and owner operator availability and the market for new and used revenue equipment 
we are self insured for a significant portion of bodily injury  property damage and cargo claims  workers compensation benefits and health claims for our employees supplemented by premium based insurance coverage above certain dollar levels 
for that reason  our financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  legal and regulatory environments and insurance coverage costs to protect against catastrophic losses 
the operating ratio is a common industry measure used to evaluate our profitability and that of our truckload segment operating fleets 
the operating ratio consists of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
the most significant variable expenses that impact the truckload segment are driver salaries and benefits  fuel  fuel taxes included in taxes and licenses expense  payments to owner operators included in rent and purchased transportation expense  supplies and maintenance and insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary based on the number of miles generated 
we also evaluate these costs on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues  per mile rates charged to customers and non trucking revenues 
as discussed further in the comparison of operating results for to  several industry wide issues could cause costs to increase in these issues include a soft freight market  changing fuel prices  higher new truck and trailer purchase prices and a weak used equipment market 
our main fixed costs include depreciation expense for tractors and trailers and equipment licensing fees included in taxes and licenses expense 
the truckload segment requires substantial cash expenditures for tractor and trailer purchases 
we fund these purchases with net cash from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 
we provide non trucking services primarily through the four operating units within our vas segment 
unlike our truckload segment  the vas segment is not asset intensive and is instead dependent upon qualified employees  information systems and qualified third party capacity providers 
the largest expense item related to the vas segment is the cost of purchased transportation we pay to third party capacity providers 
this expense item is recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense 
other operating expenses include salaries  wages and benefits and computer hardware and software depreciation 
we evaluate vas s financial performance by reviewing the gross margin percentage revenues less rent and purchased transportation expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues and the operating income percentage

higher fuel prices and higher fuel surcharge collections increase our consolidated operating ratio and the truckload segment s operating ratio when fuel surcharges are reported on a gross basis as revenues versus netting against fuel expenses

compared to operating revenues operating revenues decreased in compared to trucking revenues  excluding fuel surcharges  decreased due primarily to an decrease in the average number of tractors in service as discussed further below  a decrease in average annual miles per tractor and a decrease in average revenues per total mile 
the truckload freight market  as measured by our overall pre booked percentage of loads to trucks pre books in our one way truckload business  continued to be challenging throughout much of weekly pre books were lower than the corresponding percentage in all but a few weeks during the first nine months of pre books improved in mid september and continued to improve through the end of the year  and pre books for such period were also higher than the prior year 
in comparison  pre books declined during fourth quarter freight volumes showed some seasonal improvement as third quarter progressed and continued to improve in fourth quarter a portion of the improved pre booked percentage is due to fewer trucks  and a portion is due to more loads 
the average number of tractors in service decreased to  in from  in freight demand softness caused by the weak economy and excess truck capacity made for a challenging freight market during much of and as a result  to better match the volume of freight with the number of trucks and improve profitability  we reduced the size of our van fleet during and to approximately trucks at the end of this decrease in the van fleet was partially offset by an increase in the regional fleet 
our van fleet has the most exposure to the spot freight market and faced the most operational and competitive challenges in these difficult market conditions 
the softer freight market during  combined with excess truck capacity in the market and a high level of customer bid activity in the first half of  caused continued pressure on freight rates 
these factors resulted in a decrease in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharge  from in to in revenue per total mile decreased only  as our average percentage of empty miles improved 
much of our pricing on committed business is available for review with customers in the first half of we are planning for a better relative freight pricing market and more freight opportunities in compared to what transpired in the first half of the average percentage of empty miles improved by percentage points from in to in on a per trip basis  empty miles declined from miles per trip in to miles per trip in for freight management and statistical reporting purposes  we classify a mile without cargo in the trailer as an empty mile or deadhead mile  thus  empty miles include those empty miles generated by our dedicated fleets  most of which are billable to our dedicated customers 
the freight market in first quarter was the weakest we had experienced in the last years 
following the weak fourth quarter holiday season  high retail inventory levels in first quarter resulted in aggressive inventory destocking 
the recessionary economy combined with these inventory corrections caused first quarter shipping volumes to be very low 
thus far in first quarter  pre books in our one way truckload fleet are better than in first quarter primarily because of i improved freight volumes  ii having fewer trucks and iii a lack of inventory destocking in first quarter our pre books in are more typical for january and february  after considering our smaller truck fleet and improved shipment volumes 
we are currently optimistic that we will experience gradual improvement in the freight market during the colder weather conditions and significant winter storms that occurred in january and february will have a negative effect on our first quarter miles per truck  maintenance costs and fuel mpg 
in addition  the higher fuel prices discussed on page will have a negative impact on earnings 
fuel surcharge revenues represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel 
these revenues decreased to million in from million in in response to lower average fuel prices in to lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on our margins  we collect fuel surcharge revenues from our customers 
our fuel surcharge programs are designed to i recoup higher fuel costs from customers when fuel prices rise and ii provide customers with the benefit of lower fuel costs when fuel prices decline 
our fuel surcharge standard is a one cent per mile rate increase for every five cent per gallon increase in the doe weekly retail on highway diesel prices 
this standard is used for many fuel surcharge programs 
some customers also have their own fuel surcharge standard program for carriers 
these programs enable us to recover a majority  but not all  of the fuel price increases 
the remaining portion is generally not recoverable because it results from empty miles which are not billable to customers  out of route miles and truck idle time 
fuel prices that change rapidly in short time periods also impact our recovery because the surcharge rate in most programs only changes once per week 
in a rapidly rising fuel price market  there is generally a several week delay between the payment of higher fuel prices and surcharge recovery 
in a rapidly declining fuel price market  the opposite generally occurs  and there is a temporary higher surcharge recovery compared to the price paid for fuel 
we continue to diversify our business from the van fleet to the dedicated  regional and expedited fleets and north america cross border service provided by the truckload segment and the four operating units of the vas segment 
our goal is to attain a more balanced portfolio comprised of one way truckload which includes regional  van and expedited  dedicated and logistics which includes the vas segment services 
this diversification should help soften the impact of a weaker freight market and enables us to provide expanded services to our customers 
vas revenues are generated by its four operating units and exclude revenues for vas shipments transferred to the truckload segment  which are recorded as trucking revenues by the truckload segment 
vas revenues decreased to million in from million in due to i a reduction in the average revenue per shipment due to lower fuel prices and customer rates and ii shifting more shipments not committed to third party capacity providers to our truckload segment to help cushion the impact of a soft freight market 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in the number of vas freight shipments 
vas gross margin dollars decreased to million in from million in on the lower revenue because of the reasons noted above 
however  the vas gross margin percentage improved from in to in due to a decline in fuel prices and a lower cost of third party capacity

owner operator costs are included in rent and purchased transportation expense 
owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in owner operators are independent contractors who supply their own tractor and driver and are responsible for their operating expenses including driver pay  fuel  supplies and maintenance and fuel taxes 
this slight decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs from the rent and purchased transportation category to other expense categories 
due to this decrease  we estimate that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment was lower by approximately cents per total mile  and other expense categories had offsetting increases on a total mile basis as follows i salaries  wages and benefits  cent  ii fuel  cent  and iii depreciation  cent 
beginning in the latter months of  we took steps to manage and reduce a variety of controllable costs and adapt to a smaller fleet 
we continued by implementing numerous cost saving programs throughout examples of these cost saving measures included improving our ratio of tractors to non driver employees  reducing driver advertising  reducing driver lodging costs  restructuring discretionary driver pay programs  reducing truck sales location costs and decreasing the company matching contribution percentage for our k plan 
salaries  wages and benefits in the truckload segment decreased cent per mile on a total mile basis in compared to this decrease is primarily attributed to lower driver and non driver salaries  partially offset by higher group health insurance costs 
also offsetting these cost reductions was the effect of the lower average miles per tractor which has the effect of increasing costs of a fixed nature when evaluated on a per mile basis on the non driver  student and fringe benefit components of this expense category  as well as the shift from rent and purchased transportation expense to salaries  wages and benefits because of the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles 
although we improved our tractor to non driver ratio for the trucking operation by during  the benefit did not start to be realized until the second quarter of driver salaries decreased as progressed and following changes to some discretionary driver pay programs  resulted in lower expense per mile in the last half of higher group health insurance costs  resulting from an approximate increase in average claims costs per participant  were partially offset by lower workers compensation expense 
non driver salaries  wages and benefits in the non trucking vas segment were essentially flat 
although vas revenues were lower during  the number of shipments handled by vas in including those transferred to the truckload segment was approximately higher 
we renewed our workers compensation insurance coverage for the policy year beginning april  our coverage levels are the same as the prior policy year 
we continue to maintain a self insurance retention of million per claim 
our workers compensation insurance premiums for the policy year beginning april are slightly lower than the previous policy year  due primarily to lower projected payroll 
due to high unemployment levels  various states in which we operate have significantly raised their required unemployment tax contribution rates in as a result  we anticipate that our unemployment tax expense will increase by approximately million in compared to  with over half of the increase occurring in first quarter and the balance spread over the last three quarters of the year 
the qualified and student driver recruiting and retention markets improved in compared to the weakness in the construction and automotive industries  other trucking company failures and fleet reductions and the higher national unemployment rate contributed to improved driver recruiting and retention 
these factors resulted in limited employment options for drivers and consequently made more qualified and student drivers available in the workforce 
we anticipate that availability of drivers will remain good until economic conditions improve 
when economic conditions improve  competition for qualified drivers will likely increase  and we cannot predict whether we will experience future driver shortages 
if such a shortage were to occur and driver pay rate increases became necessary to attract and retain drivers  our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases 
fuel decreased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to lower average diesel fuel prices and fuel efficiency improvements 
average diesel fuel prices in were per gallon lower than in  a decrease 
average monthly fuel prices in were lower than those in the comparable months of for the first ten months  only exceeding levels late in the year when prices rapidly declined 
during  we continued to improve fuel miles per gallon mpg through several initiatives to improve fuel efficiency 
we improved fuel mpg on a year over year basis for the eleventh consecutive quarter in fouth quarter these initiatives have been ongoing since march and include i reducing truck engine idle time  ii lowering non billable miles  iii increasing the percentage of aerodynamic  more fuel efficient trucks in the company truck fleet and iv installing apus in company trucks 
truck engine idle time percentages can be affected by seasonal weather patterns such as warm summer months and cold winter months that prompt drivers to idle the engine to provide air conditioning or heating for comfort during non driving periods 
thus  engine idle time percentages for trucks without apus may be higher and fuel mpg may be lower as a result during the summer and winter months as compared to temperate spring and fall months 
apus allow the driver to heat or cool the truck without idling the main engine and consume less diesel fuel than the engine 
as of december   we had installed apus in approximately of the company owned truck fleet  compared to about as of december  as a result of these fuel saving initiatives  we improved our company truck average mpg by in compared to this mpg improvement resulted in the purchase of million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in than in this equates to a reduction of approximately  tons of carbon dioxide emissions 
we intend to continue these and other environmentally conscious initiatives  including our active participation as an epa smartway transport partner 
the smartway transport partnership is a national voluntary program developed by the epa and freight industry representatives to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution and promote cleaner  more efficient ground freight transportation 
we have historically been successful recouping a majority  but not all  of fuel cost increases through our fuel surcharge program 
when fuel prices rise rapidly  a negative earnings lag occurs because the cost of fuel rises immediately and the market indexes used to determine fuel surcharges increase at a slower pace 
as a result  during these rising fuel price periods  the negative impact of fuel on our financial results is more significant 
this was the trend during the first two quarters of in a period of declining fuel prices  we generally experience a temporary favorable earnings effect because fuel costs decline at a faster pace than the market indexes used to determine fuel surcharge collections 
this trend began during third quarter as fuel prices began to decrease and continued through most of first quarter this resulted in temporarily lower net fuel expense that helped to offset uncompensated fuel costs from truck idling  empty miles not billable to customers and out of route miles 
fuel prices rose over during second quarter most of the increase occurred during the second half of the quarter and then remained flat to slightly higher for the remainder of for january and february of  the average diesel fuel price per gallon was cents higher than the average diesel fuel price per gallon in the same period of and cents higher than the average for first quarter as described above  periods of rising fuel prices result in a negative effect on our financial results 
in contrast  the lower fuel prices experienced in the first half of  which followed the rapid fuel price decline in fourth quarter  resulted in a temporary favorable impact on net fuel costs and earnings in first quarter as a result  these higher fuel prices in first quarter will have a negative impact on earnings compared to first quarter shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices and petroleum product rationing can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we are unable to predict whether fuel price levels will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to through our cost savings programs and improved driver retention  we realized decreases in driver related costs such as driver advertising and referral fees  motels and travel 
these savings were partially offset by a slight increase in the average age of our company truck fleet from years at december  to years at december   which contributes to higher maintenance costs including maintenance that is not covered by warranty 
taxes and licenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to due to a decrease in fuel taxes per mile resulting from the improvement in the company truck mpg 
an improved mpg results in fewer gallons of diesel fuel purchased and consequently less fuel taxes paid 
this decrease was partially offset by the effect of lower average miles per tractor on the fixed cost components primarily equipment licensing fees of this operating expense category 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment decreased cent per total mile in compared to for small liability claims  in we experienced net favorable development on claims that occurred in prior years compared to net unfavorable development in  which was partially offset by slightly higher expense on a per mile basis related to claims incurred in the current year period 
for large liability claims  our expense for claims incurred in the current year period was essentially flat from to  and the amount we recorded for net unfavorable development on prior year claims was lower in than in we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  and continue to be responsible for the first million per claim with an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million 
the annual aggregate for claims in excess of million and less than million increased from million to million 
we maintain liability coverage with insurance carriers substantially in excess of the million per claim 
see item legal proceedings for information on our bodily injury and property damage coverage levels since august  our liability insurance premium dollars for the policy year that began august  are slightly lower than the previous policy year but increased about on a per mile basis 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to nearly half of the increase resulted from the effect of the lower average miles per tractor on this fixed cost 
the remainder of the increase was due to depreciation of the apus installed on more company trucks and a higher ratio of trailers to tractors resulting from the tractor fleet reductions 
while we incur depreciation expense on the apus  we also incur lower fuel expense because tractors with apus consume much less fuel during periods of truck idling 
depreciation expense was historically affected by the engine emissions standards imposed by the epa that became effective in october and applied to all new trucks purchased after that time  resulting in increased truck purchase costs 
depreciation expense is affected because in january  a second set of more strict epa engine emissions standards became effective for all newly manufactured truck engines 
compared to trucks with engines produced before  the trucks with new engines manufactured under the standards had higher purchase prices 
we began to take delivery of trucks with these standard engines in first quarter to replace older trucks in our fleet 
as of december   of the engines in our fleet of company owned trucks were manufactured by caterpillar 
in june  caterpillar announced it would not produce on highway engines for use in the united states that would comply with new epa engine emissions standards effective in january but caterpillar would continue to sell on highway engines internationally 
caterpillar also announced it is pursuing a strategic alliance with navistar 
approximately one million trucks in the us domestic market have caterpillar heavy duty engines  and caterpillar has stated it will fully support these engines going forward 
in january  a final set of more rigorous epa mandated emissions standards became effective for all new engines manufactured after that date 
it is expected that these trucks will have a higher purchase price than trucks manufactured to meet the epa engine emission standards but may be more fuel efficient 
in late  we received a small number of engines that meet the standards and are testing them in we are currently evaluating the options available to us to adapt to the standards 
we do not currently expect to purchase many new trucks with engines in rent and purchased transportation expense consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas segment and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the truckload segment 
the payments to third party capacity providers generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in due primarily to i decreased fuel prices that resulted in lower reimbursements to owner operators for fuel during most of compared to and ii the shift from rent and purchased transportation expense to salaries  wages and benefits expense because of the decrease in owner operator truck miles as a percentage of total miles 
fuel reimbursements to owner operators amounted to million in compared to million in our customer fuel surcharge programs do not differentiate between miles generated by company owned and owner operator trucks 
challenging operating conditions continue to make owner operator recruitment and retention difficult for us 
such conditions include inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of owner operators and a shortage of financing for equipment 
we have historically been able to add company owned tractors and recruit additional company drivers to offset any decrease in the number of owner operators 
if a shortage of owner operators and company drivers occurs  increases in per mile settlement rates for owner operators and driver pay rates for company drivers may become necessary to attract and retain these drivers 
this could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we would be unable to obtain corresponding freight rate increases 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment increased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets primarily trucks and trailers are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses and are reported net of sales related expenses which include costs to prepare the equipment for sale 
gains on sales of assets decreased to million in from million in buyer demand for used trucks and trailers remained low due to the weak freight market and recessionary economy 
during the first half of  we closed eight lower volume fleet truck sales offices and continue to operate in eight locations across the continental united states 
we believe our wholly owned subsidiary and used truck and trailer retail network  fleet truck sales  is one of the larger class truck and equipment retail entities in the united states 
fleet truck sales continues to be our resource for remarketing our used trucks and trailers  in addition to trading trucks to original equipment manufacturers when purchasing new trucks 
other expense income we recorded interest income of million in compared to million in our average cash and cash equivalents balances were similar in both years  but the average interest rate earned on these funds was considerably lower in due to a decrease in market interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes was for versus for the higher income tax rate can be attributed to higher state taxes 
compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in the average number of tractors in service as discussed further below  partially offset by a increase in average annual miles per tractor 
the truckload freight market  as measured by our overall pre booked percentage of loads to trucks  was softer during most of compared to freight demand was lower the first five months of compared to the first five months of in june  freight volumes improved and exceeded those of june but were approximately the same in third quarter compared to third quarter during fourth quarter  freight volumes declined and were significantly lower than fourth quarter the industry wide accelerated purchase of new trucks in advance of the epa engine emissions standards contributed to excess truck capacity that partially disrupted the supply and demand balance during early these excess trucks  along with a weakening economy  resulted in lower freight volumes during the first five months of compared to fuel prices increased significantly beginning in late february and peaked in july  contributing to an increase in trucking company failures 
we believe these failures resulted in a more even balance of truck supply to freight demand  which caused pre books in june to exceed those in june and pre books during third quarter to be flat compared to third quarter a very weak retail environment combined with extremely soft construction and manufacturing markets resulted in fewer available shipments during fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter fuel prices also decreased significantly during fourth quarter  resulting in fewer trucking company failures during fourth quarter freight demand softness caused by the weak economy and excess truck capacity made for a challenging freight market during much of we believe these factors increased price competition for freight in the spot market as carriers competed for loads to maintain truck productivity 
as a result  to better match the volume of freight with the number of trucks and improve profitability  we reduced the size of our van fleet by trucks in  including a reduction of trucks during fourth quarter this decrease in the van fleet was partially offset by an increase in trucks in the more profitable regional and expedited fleets  as total trucks decreased by during as freight demand deteriorated during fourth quarter and into january  we reduced the van fleet by an additional trucks in january from march to january  we reduced the van fleet from  trucks to about  trucks a reduction of  trucks 
the average percentage of empty miles decreased to in from in this decrease was the result of a decrease in the average empty miles percentage related to the dedicated fleets 
these fleets generally operate according to arrangements under which we provide trucks and or trailers for a specific customer s exclusive use 
under nearly all of these arrangements  dedicated customers pay us on an all mile basis regardless of whether trailers are loaded or empty to obtain guaranteed truck and or trailer capacity 
if we excluded the dedicated fleet  the average empty mile percentage would be in and in this increase resulted from the weaker freight market and more regional shipments with shorter lengths of haul 
fuel surcharge revenues increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in vas revenues increased to million in from million in due to an increase in brokerage  intermodal and international revenues 
this growth was partially offset by a structural change to a customer s continuing third party carrier arrangement that became effective in july consequently  we began reporting vas revenues for this customer on a net basis revenues net of purchased transportation expense rather than on a gross basis 
this change affected the reporting of vas revenues and purchased transportation expenses for this customer in third quarter and subsequent periods 
this reporting change resulted in a reduction in vas revenues and vas rent and purchased transportation expense of million comparing to this reporting change had no impact on the dollar amount of vas gross margin or operating income 
excluding the affected freight revenues for this customer from revenues  vas revenues grew in compared to vas gross margin dollars increased during compared to due to an improvement in the gross margin percentage in the intermodal and international units offset by a decrease in the brokerage unit gross margin percentage 
brokerage revenues increased in compared to  but the brokerage gross margin percentage and operating income percentage declined 
these declines were due to i fuel price declines during the second half of and ii the tightening of truckload capacity in the first half of due to increased carrier failures  which made it more challenging for brokerage to obtain qualified third party carriers at a comparable margin to intermodal revenues increased by  and its operating income percentage also improved 
international  formed in july  revenues grew  and it achieved an improved gross margin percentage 
freight management successfully distributed freight to other operating divisions and continues to secure new customer business awards that generate additional freight opportunities across all company business units

salaries  wages and benefits in the truckload segment increased cents per mile on a total mile basis in compared to this increase is primarily attributed to higher student pay average active trainer teams increased  higher workers compensation expense and  as discussed above  the shift from rent and purchased transportation to salaries  wages and benefits because of the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles 
within the truckload segment  these cost increases were offset partially by lower non driver pay for office and equipment maintenance personnel due to efficiency and cost control improvements and lower group health insurance costs 
non driver salaries  wages and benefits increased in the non trucking vas segment due to growth in the vas segment 
the qualified and student driver recruiting and retention markets improved in compared to the weakness in the construction and automotive industries  trucking company failures and fleet reductions and a rising national unemployment rate continued to positively affect our driver availability and selectivity 
in addition  we believe our strong mileage utilization and financial strength are attractive to drivers when compared to other carriers 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to higher average diesel fuel prices offset partially by fuel efficiency improvements 
average fuel prices in were cents per gallon higher than in  a increase 
average monthly fuel prices in were higher than those in the comparable months of for the first ten months  with the amount of change over increasing steadily through june per gallon higher than june 
fuel prices began to fall in july and fell below the levels in the last two months of december prices were per gallon lower than december 
during  we implemented numerous initiatives to improve fuel efficiency and our fuel miles per gallon 
these initiatives include i reducing truck engine idle time  ii lowering non billable miles  iii increasing the percentage of aerodynamic  more fuel efficient trucks in the company truck fleet and iv installing apus in company trucks 
as of december   we had installed apus in approximately of the company owned truck fleet 
as a result of these initiatives  we improved our company truck average mpg by in compared to this mpg improvement resulted in the purchase of million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in than in this equates to a reduction of approximately  tons of carbon dioxide emissions 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to an increase in the average age of our company truck fleet from years at december  to years at december  caused an increase in maintenance cost per mile 
in addition to the higher average truck age  a higher percentage of the repairs was performed over the road as a result of the decrease in our equipment maintenance personnel see previous discussion of salaries  wages and benefits 
over the road vendors also raised their labor and parts rates during  which contributed to the increase in maintenance costs 
the prices of some parts purchased from over the road vendors  as well as those purchased for use in our shops  increased in because of higher commodity prices 
taxes and licenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to due to a decrease in fuel taxes per mile resulting from the improvement in the company truck mpg 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment increased from cents per total mile in to cents per total mile in an increase of cents per total mile 
of this increase  cents per total mile relates to unfavorable claims development on larger claims that occurred in years prior to offset partially by lower large claims incurred in the development of these prior year claims will limit further negative development on other large claims in these same policy years as we have now met our annual aggregates in some of these older policy years 
we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  and continue to be responsible for the first million per claim with an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million 
the annual aggregate for claims between million and million was lowered from million to million effective with the new policy year beginning august  see item legal proceedings for information on our bodily injury and property damage coverage levels since august  our liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  were slightly lower than the previous policy year 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to this increase was due primarily to depreciation of the apus installed on company trucks and  to a lesser extent  to higher costs of tractors purchased during and a higher ratio of trailers to tractors resulting from the reduction of our fleet 
the apu depreciation expense is offset by lower fuel costs because tractors with apus generally consume less fuel during periods of idle 
higher average miles per tractor during compared to has the effect of lowering this fixed cost when evaluated on a per mile basis and offset a portion of the increases discussed above 
depreciation expense was historically affected by the engine emissions standards imposed by the epa that became effective in october and applied to all new trucks purchased after that time  resulting in increased truck purchase costs 
depreciation expense is affected because in january  a second set of more strict epa engine emissions standards became effective for all newly manufactured truck engines 
compared to trucks with engines produced before  the trucks with new engines manufactured under the standards had higher purchase prices 
we began to take delivery of trucks with these standard engines in first quarter to replace older trucks in our fleet 
as of december   of the engines in our fleet of company owned trucks were manufactured by caterpillar 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in as discussed on page  the vas segment s rent and purchased transportation expense was affected by a structural change to a large vas customer s continuing third party carrier arrangement that became effective in july that change resulted in a reduction in vas revenues and vas rent and purchased transportation expense of million from to excluding the rent and purchased transportation expense for this customer  the dollar amount of this expense increased for the vas segment by compared to an increase in vas revenues of 
rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in due primarily to increased fuel prices that necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel during most of compared to  offset slightly by a decrease in the percentage of owner operator truck miles versus company truck miles 
fuel reimbursements to owner operators amounted to million in compared to million in these higher fuel reimbursements resulted in an increase of cents per total mile 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment increased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets decreased to million in from million in  or a reduction of cents per mile 
we believe fleet truck sales demand softened during due to the softer freight market and higher fuel prices 
at the same time  carrier failures and company fleet reductions increased the supply of used trucks for sale 
we continued to sell our oldest van trailers that are fully depreciated 
other expense income we recorded million of interest expense in versus million of interest expense in our average outstanding debt per month in was over million  while in we had no outstanding debt until the end of november we had million of debt outstanding and cash and cash equivalents of million at december   for a net cash position of million 
our interest income was million in and our average cash and cash equivalents balance was higher in than in  but the average interest rate earned on these funds was lower in income taxes our effective income tax rate was for versus for during fourth quarter  we reached a tentative settlement agreement with an internal revenue service irs appeals officer regarding a significant tax deduction based on a timing difference between financial reporting and tax reporting for our to federal income tax returns 
during fourth quarter  we accrued the estimated cumulative interest charges  net of income taxes  of million for the anticipated settlement of this matter 
the irs finalized the settlement during third quarter  and we paid to the irs the federal accrued interest at the beginning of october we filed amended state returns reporting the irs settlement changes to the states where required during fourth quarter  many of which were pending state review to settle our state interest liabilities 
our total payments during  before considering the tax benefit from the deductibility of these payments  were million for federal and million to various states 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties directly related to income taxes as additional income tax expense

liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated cash flow from operations of million  a decrease million  compared to the year ended december  this decrease is attributed primarily to i a million decrease in cash flows related to insurance and claims accruals both current and long term due primarily to the settlement of some larger claims  ii a million decrease in cash flows related to accounts receivable because of a decrease in fuel surcharge billings at the end of due to lower fuel prices and lower revenues attributed to the smaller fleet size in and iii a million decrease in cash flows related to accrued payroll 
cash flow from operations increased million in compared to  or 
the increase in cash flow from operations in compared to was attributed to i a million change in cash flows related to accounts payable  primarily due to the timing of payments  ii a lower accounts receivable balance resulting from a decrease in the average fuel surcharge billed per trip at the end of and iii the effect of million lower gains on disposal of operating equipment  offset by iv lower net income of million 
we were able to make net capital expenditures  repurchase common stock and pay dividends because of the cash flow from operations and existing cash balances  supplemented by net borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million in from million in net property additions primarily revenue equipment were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period of the decrease occurred because we took delivery of substantially fewer new trailers in than in the million increase in investing cash flows from to occurred because we began to take delivery of new trucks in  while we took delivery of substantially fewer new trucks during to delay purchases of more expensive trucks with standard engines 
as of december   we were committed to property and equipment purchases  net of trades  of approximately million 
we currently expect our estimated net capital expenditures primarily revenue equipment to be in the range of million to million in we intend to fund these net capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 
net financing activities used million in  million in and million in the increase from to included debt repayments net of borrowings of million in compared to net borrowings of million in we had net repayments of million in we paid dividends of million in  million in and million in the and dividends included special dividends of per share million total paid in december and per share million total paid in december we increased our quarterly dividend rate by per share beginning with the dividend paid in july financing activities also included common stock repurchases of million in and million in from time to time  the company has repurchased  and may continue to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on market and other factors 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares pursuant to our current board of directors repurchase authorization and had  shares remaining available for repurchase 
management believes our financial position at december  is strong 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of stockholders equity 
cash is invested primarily in government portfolio money market funds 
we do not hold any investments in auction rate securities 
as of december   we had a total of million of credit pursuant to two credit facilities  of which we had no borrowings outstanding 
the million of credit available under these facilities is further reduced by the million in letters of credit under which we are obligated 
these letters of credit are primarily required as security for insurance policies 
as of december   we did not have any non cancelable revenue equipment operating leases and therefore had no off balance sheet revenue equipment debt 
based on our strong financial position  management does not foresee any significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  caption payments due by period in millions more less than than period total year years years years unknown

we have committed credit facilities with two banks totaling million that mature in may million and may million 
borrowings under these credit facilities bear variable interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities with banks 
the credit available under these facilities is further reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit under which we are obligated 
the unused lines of credit are available to us in the event we need financing for the replacement of our fleet or for other significant capital expenditures 
given our strong financial position  we expect that we could obtain additional financing  if necessary 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
equipment purchase commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures 
as of december   we have recorded a million liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we expect million to be settled within the next twelve months and are unable to reasonably determine when the million categorized as period unknown will be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements in  we did not have any non cancelable revenue equipment operating leases or other arrangements that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
critical accounting policies we operate in the truckload and logistics sectors of the transportation industry 
in the truckload sector  we focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that generally ship consistently throughout the year 
in the logistics sector  besides managing transportation requirements for individual customers  we provide additional sources of truck capacity  alternative modes of transportation  a global delivery network and systems analysis to optimize transportation needs 
our success depends on our ability to efficiently manage our resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to our customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand and may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
our ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is essential to efficient resource deployment  making capital investments in tractors and trailers and obtaining qualified third party capacity at a reasonable price 
although our business volume is not highly concentrated  we also may be occasionally affected by our customers financial failures or loss of customer business 
our most significant resource requirements are company drivers  owner operators  tractors  trailers and related equipment operating costs such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance and supplies and maintenance 
to mitigate our risk to fuel price increases  we recover from our customers additional fuel surcharges that recoup a majority  but not all  of the increased fuel costs  however  we cannot assure that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
our financial results are also affected by company driver and owner operator availability and the new and used revenue equipment market 
because we are self insured for a significant portion of bodily injury  property damage and cargo claims and for workers compensation benefits and health claims for our employees supplemented by premium based insurance coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  legal and regulatory environments and insurance coverage costs to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale for example  three years for tractors are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the lives and salvage values used in calculating depreciation expense and adjust these assumptions appropriately when warranted 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets classified as held and used  the carrying amount is not recoverable when the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the sum of the future net cash flows 
we do not separately identify assets by operating segment because tractors and trailers are routinely transferred from one operating fleet to another 
as a result  none of our long lived assets have identifiable cash flows from use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
thus  the asset group used to assess impairment would include all of our assets 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and noncurrent are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates including negative development and estimates of incurred but not reported losses using loss development factors based upon past experience 
an actuary reviews our self insurance reserves for bodily injury and property damage claims and workers compensation claims every six months 
policies for revenue recognition 
operating revenues including fuel surcharge revenues and related direct costs are recorded when the shipment is delivered 
for shipments where a third party capacity provider including owner operators under contract with us is utilized to provide some or all of the service and we i are the primary obligor in regard to the shipment delivery  ii establish customer pricing separately from carrier rate negotiations  iii generally have discretion in carrier selection and or iv have credit risk on the shipment  we record both revenues for the dollar value of services we bill to the customer and rent and purchased transportation expense for transportation costs we pay to the third party provider upon the shipment s delivery 
in the absence of the conditions listed above  we record revenues net of those expenses related to third party providers 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine i the provision for income taxes  ii whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part and iii the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations 
accordingly  if facts or financial circumstances change and consequently impact the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  we would need to apply management s judgment to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review the financial condition of customers for granting credit and monitor changes in customers financial conditions on an ongoing basis 
we determine the allowance based on analysis of individual customers financial condition  our historical write off experience and national economic conditions 
during the last two years  numerous significant events affected the us financial markets and resulted in significant reduction of credit availability and liquidity 
consequently  we believe some of our customers may be unable to obtain or retain adequate financing to support their businesses in the future 
we anticipate that because of these combined factors  some of our customers may also be compelled to restructure their businesses or may be unable to pay amounts owed to us 
we have formal policies in place to continually monitor credit extended to customers and to manage our credit risk 
we maintain credit insurance for some customer accounts 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on information currently available 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact our results of operations from period to period 
inflation inflation may impact our operating costs 
a prolonged inflation period could cause rises in interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs 
these inflationary increases could adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we had no debt outstanding at december  interest rates on our unused credit facilities are based on the libor 
increases in interest rates could impact our annual interest expense on future borrowings 
as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations attributed to changes in the level of global oil production  refining capacity  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have recovered a majority  but not all  of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we implemented customer fuel surcharge programs with most of our customers to offset much of the higher fuel cost per gallon 
however  we do not recover all of the fuel cost increase through these surcharge programs 
we cannot predict the extent to which fuel prices will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in several foreign countries  including mexico  canada  china and australia 
to date  most foreign revenues are denominated in us dollars  and we receive payment for foreign freight services primarily in us dollars to reduce direct foreign currency risk 
assets and liabilities maintained by a foreign subsidiary company in the local currency are subject to foreign exchange gains or losses 
foreign currency translation gains and losses primarily relate to changes in the value of revenue equipment owned by a subsidiary in mexico  whose functional currency is the peso 
foreign currency translation gains were million in and losses were million for and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
amounts of gains and losses for were not material 
the exchange rate between the mexican peso and the us dollar was pesos to at december  compared to pesos to at december  and pesos to at december
