item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to kcs 
interest rate sensitivity 
floating rate indebtedness totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
a credit agreement  comprised of a revolving credit facility and term loan facilities  contains variable rate debt which accrues interest based on target interest indexes london interbank offered rate libor or an alternative base rate plus an applicable spread  as set forth in the credit agreement 
the company has an aggregate notional amount of million of interest rate hedges at december   which effectively convert interest payments from variable rates to fixed rates 
given the balance of million at december  of variable rate debt net of interest rate hedges  kcs is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  a hypothetical basis points increase in each of the respective target interest indexes would result in additional interest expense of million on an annualized basis for the net floating rate instruments issued by the company as of december  based upon the borrowing rates available to kcs and its subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of debt was approximately  million and  million at december  and  respectively  compared with a carrying value of  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
commodity price sensitivity 
kcs periodically participates in diesel fuel purchase commitment and swap transactions 
at december  and  kcs did not have any outstanding fuel swap agreements 
the company also holds fuel inventories for use in operations 
these inventories are not material to kcs overall financial position 
fuel costs are expected to mirror market conditions in  however  fuel cost are unpredictable and subject to a variety of factors outside the company s control 
kcs is able to reduce the impact of increased fuel costs through fuel surcharge revenues from customers 
assuming annual consumption of million gallons  a cent change in the price per gallon of fuel would cause an million change in operating expenses 
foreign exchange sensitivity 
kcsm uses the dollar as its functional currency 
earnings from kcsm included in the company s results of operations reflect revaluation gains and losses that kcsm records in the process of remeasuring certain transactions from pesos to dollars 
therefore  the company has exposure to fluctuations in the value of the peso 
kcs manages this risk by monitoring its peso denominated cash inflows and outflows 
for example  a hypothetical increase in the us dollar to the mexican peso exchange rate on net peso denominated monetary assets of ps 
million would result in a loss of approximately million and a decrease in the exchange rate would result in a gain of approximately million
