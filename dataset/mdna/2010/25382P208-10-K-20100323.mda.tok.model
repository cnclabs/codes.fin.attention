current trends and recent developments for the company overview we supply technology based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities  primarily for the law enforcement and security industries 
we have the ability to integrate electronic  radio  computer  mechanical  and multi media technologies to create unique solutions to our customers requests 
we began shipping our flagship digital video mirror in march and enjoyed significant growth until the fourth quarter we have developed additional products to complement our dvm and dvm in car video products 
in that respect  we launched the new dvm ultra product for motorcycles  atv s and marine use during the third quarter of and we launched the firstvu body worn camera product during the fourth quarter we have additional research and development projects that we anticipate will result in several new products to be launched in we believe that the launch of these new products will help to diversify and increase our product offerings resulting in increased revenues in the future 
we have regained profitability during the third and fourth quarters of for which we reported operating income of  and  on revenues of  and  during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
this reverses the negative trend experienced during the previous three quarters in which our operating losses totaled  second quarter   first quarter and  fourth quarter 
we have regained profitability primarily as a result of significant cost containment measures  revenue increases and improved gross margins on sales 
sales and gross margins have improved because of the successful launch of the dvm product and gains in production efficiencies of such product 
we shipped an international order for the new dvm product in excess of million during the fourth quarter which contributed to the increased revenues 
we have experienced a general increase in inventory levels during the same time frame 
there have been a number of factors trends affecting our recent performance  which include we experienced a decrease in revenues during the fourth quarter and first quarter due in part to the challenging economy  which has negatively impacted state  county and municipal budgets 
we expect that the current economic downturn will continue to depress certain state and local tax bases  and continue to make a challenging business environment 
our revenues in the second  third and fourth quarters of improved over the first quarter and we expect that our sales for will improve if these conditions begin to abate 
we had record revenues for the fourth quarter we believe that delays in the introduction of our dvm resulted in significant lost revenues in and contributed to our decreased revenues and operating losses in  along with the economic recession 
we were not able to compete for several large contracts that required the specifications of the dvm in addition  we bought substantial quantities of component parts in the fourth quarter and first quarter in anticipation of commencing commercial production of the dvm beginning in the fourth quarter  which increased our inventory balances 
commercial deliveries of the dvm commenced in the second quarter  which were a prime component of our improved sales for the second  third and fourth quarters of over the first quarter of we expect that our current order backlog for the dvm and continued acceptance of this new product will help to improve our revenues in over  despite the current economic recession 
we anticipated that the assembly line changeover to the new dvm plus and dvm products would occur during the fourth quarter we built significant quantities of the legacy dvm model in october and november to handle anticipated product demand during the conversion period 
as a result we held approximately  dvm units in finished goods inventory at december  the number of these units has been reduced to less than units at december  though sales activities in we are planning to build to additional dvm units during the first quarter of to handle current customer demands for this legacy product 
we have not found it necessary to offer any significant discounts to sell the dvm units because their retail price point is below both the dvm plus and the dvm in addition  we need to maintain a minimal quantity of these units for warranty and service purposes 
we believe that current and potential customers may be delaying orders due to a number of factors  including budget reductions and anticipation of receiving the federal government s stimulus funds in order to preserve their currently available funding and budgets 
in light of the historically high levels of federal funding  estimated at over billion  allocated to law enforcement under the american recovery and reinvestment act  the omnibus appropriations act of  and other programs  we expect that law enforcement agencies will have access to federal funding which has not been available to them in the past 
we believe that such funding could have a positive impact on our revenues in the future  but cannot predict the amount of the funds that will be used for products such as ours or the timing of the release of such funds 
we were able to reduce our inventory levels substantially during the fourth quarter of and we anticipate that our inventory balances will continue to decline in as our sales increase and as we continue to maintain stricter inventory control 
our international revenues decreased substantially during the fourth quarter and the first three quarters of sales to certain countries that were strong revenue sources for us historically have been negatively impacted by political and social unrest  economic recession and a weakening of their currency exchange rates versus the us dollar 
we have focused on our international business by hiring an international sales manager in january  hiring a european based sales manager in november and by appointing international distributers in new countries during we expect that international sales will improve during  based on an easing of economic  political and social conditions affecting certain of our key international customers and as initial sales to new countries occur  although we can make no assurances in this regard 
in addition  we believe that the availability of the dvm will help to improve our international revenues 
during october  we received an international order from turkey for dvm units valued in excess of million 
this order represented our largest single international or domestic order for and was shipped during the fourth quarter we are encouraged by this shipment because it illustrates the potential popularity of our new dvm product 
our recent operating losses and increases in inventory levels led to deterioration in our cash levels and liquidity in compared to fiscal we have an unused million revolving line of credit which would provide us short term liquidity should the need arise  provided that we continue to satisfy the facility s covenants  one of which is maintaining a million minimum tangible net worth 
currently  we have no long or short term debt outstanding and have approximately million in working capital 
management is focusing on reducing inventory and accounts receivable levels to generate additional liquidity and improve our cash position 
we believe that our liquidity trends will continue to improve during if our revenues and profitability increase and that our current credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating needs for the reasonably foreseeable future 
our line of credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million until its maturity date in april we had a tangible net worth in excess of million at december  if we do not remain profitable and operating losses recur  we may be at risk of not meeting such requirement 
if we do not maintain the required tangible net worth  the bank would have the discretion to discontinue any advances under the credit facility 
in addition  the line of credit matures in april and there can be no assurance that our bank will be willing to extend or renew the facility under terms that are mutually agreeable 
we will seek to renew or replace the current line of credit when it matures and eventually to replace it with longer term credit facilities 
we do not consider raising capital through an equity offering to be a viable alternative to supplement working capital needs  given our current public equity valuation 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions  changes in the financial conditions  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenue or expenses 
we are a party to operating leases and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments described in note to our consolidated financial statements and we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that represent commitments to future payments for goods and services 
we are contingently liable as of december  for standby letters of credit issued by our bank for an aggregate amount of  to certain customers as security if we do not complete our contractual obligation to deliver products 
the outstanding standby letters expire in march we have never had a beneficiary demand funding related to such standby letters of credit 
for the year ended december  and results of operations summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent sub sections is an analysis of our operating results for the years ended december  and  represented as a percentage of total revenues for each respective year year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expense selling  advertising and promotional expense stock based compensation expense charges related to purchase and cancellation of employee stock options vendor settlements and credits general and administrative expense total selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest income expense income loss before income tax provision income tax provision benefit net income loss net income loss per share information basic diluted revenues in december  we introduced an upgrade to the dvm legacy product  the dvm plus model  which targets the smaller and rural police agencies typically with less than uniformed officers 
during the second quarter we launched the new dvm product series with many advanced features that targets larger police agencies and urban areas 
the dvm has allowed us to pursue a new market that we were not previously able to target with our legacy dvm product series 
we also expanded our product line in the third quarter through the introduction of our dvm ultra model that targets motorcycle  boat and atv markets  and in the fourth quarter  we introduced the firstvu  which is a small mobile product that clips onto an officer s pocket or uniform 
we anticipate that our new products including the dvm  dvm plus  dvm ultra and firstvu  will contribute to our revenues as we phase out our dvm legacy product 
we plan to discontinue the manufacture of the dvm legacy product during and will attempt to migrate its historical customers to our dvm plus product or dvm model 
revenues for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of   due to the following factors we experienced a decrease in revenues due to the challenging economy that negatively impacted state  county and municipal budgets 
we believe that current and potential customers may have delayed their orders due to a number of factors  including their local budget reductions and anticipation of receiving the federal government s stimulus funds in order to preserve their currently available funding and budgets 
our average order size decreased from approximately  in fiscal to  during fiscal we shipped individual orders in excess of  each for an aggregate of million in revenue in compared to orders individually in excess of  for total revenue aggregate of approximately million in we believe that this is indicative of reduced law enforcement budgets where the customers are covering only the minimum required needs rather than full fleet deployments 
however  during the fourth quarter we shipped nine individual orders in excess of  a quarterly record for us 
we are hopeful that this may indicate an easing of such budgetary constraints and that a normal purchasing pattern will return during  although we can make no assurances in this regard 
our international revenues decreased substantially to  representing of total revenues during fiscal compared to  representing of total revenues during fiscal sales to certain countries that were strong revenue sources for us on an historical basis were negatively impacted by political and social unrest  economic recession and a weakening of their currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 
we have focused on improving our international business by hiring an international sales manager in january  hiring a salesman to cover europe and the middle east territories and appointing international distribution agents in new countries since january   which brings our total to agents representing our products in various countries throughout the world 
we experienced an increase in inquiries and bid activity from international customers in the fourth quarter however  international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business 
during october  we were awarded a million plus contract for our dvm product from a customer in turkey that shipped in the fourth quarter we maintained consistent retail pricing on our dvm models during and do not plan any material changes in pricing during for the dvm product series or the new products recently introduced 
our new mirror based products include the dvm ultra model and the dvm  which will be sold at higher retail pricing levels compared to the legacy products during due to increased features 
cost of revenue cost of revenue on units sold for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease in costs of goods sold is commensurate with the decrease in revenues offset by an increase in the cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues resulting from the impact of the introduction of the new dvm and dvm ultra product lines and the upgraded dvm plus 
the dvm was launched during the second quarter and the dvm plus product was introduced in late  but commercial production was ramped up during the second and third quarters of there were inefficiencies  training  rework and a high failure rate at final burn in that contributed to increased production costs during the year ended december  such product conversion costs and inefficiencies are main focuses of management and engineering at the current time 
production rates for the new models have steadily improved throughout the year ended december   reaching planned production rates of to units per day in late in addition  failure and rework rates are improving  but have not yet reached target levels 
we anticipate that such rates will continue to improve dramatically during costs associated with the production line conversion to dvm  dvm ultra and dvm plus products  including the training  rework and high failure rates of the dvm units coupled with a significant decrease in revenues during the year ended december   resulted in a substantial increase in our cost of revenues as a percent of revenues to compared to the rate during the year ended december  we expect that our new product offerings during and will likely continue to negatively impact our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for  but hope for a modest improvement compared to levels as we increase our sales and implement production efficiencies 
we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures to ramp up production of the new products because our internal process is largely assembling subcomponents  testing and shipping of completed products 
we rely on our subcontractors to produce finished circuit boards that represent the primary components in our products  thereby reducing our need to purchase capital equipment 
however  we will need to acquire test and calibration equipment to ensure that the completed products meet our specifications and requirements  which we expect will cost less than  we had  in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at december  we had fewer than units of the legacy dvm units in finished goods at december   which we expect to sell during without any price discounts 
total raw materials and component parts were  and  as of december  and  respectively  a decline of  we believe that our obsolescence risk was less at december  than in the prior year because of the decline in the number of our dvm legacy systems in finished goods inventory and the overall reduction in raw materials and component parts 
we believe these reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at december  and the new product introductions that we anticipate during we primarily order finished component parts  including electronics boards  chips and camera parts  from outside suppliers 
our internal work consists of assembly  testing and burn in of the finished units 
we have added indirect production and purchasing personnel to better manage and gain efficiencies in our production process as we expanded our product line during and in expectation for we are concentrating on improving our raw material and component costs by managing our supply chain through quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices 
we believe that if we can increase our production rate and expand product lines during  we will be able to eventually reduce our component and supply chain costs by ordering in larger quantities with more pricing leverage 
in addition  we believe if we can increase production rates for  we may stimulate some efficiency in our assembly  testing and burn in process that should lead to improvements in our cost of sales 
nonetheless  the impact of these supply chain efficiencies on our cost of revenue during may be diminished somewhat by the introduction of new products on our cost of revenue during  resulting in an improved cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue but not reaching our level of gross profit gross profit for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the significant decrease is commensurate with the decline in revenues and increase in cost of revenues as a percent of sales that we experienced during the year ended december  the gross profit percentage decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we expect that our margins will be lower than normal on revenues contributed by our new products as we bring these products into commercial production during however  as revenues increase from these products  we will seek to improve our margins from these new products through economies of scale and more effectively utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components 
we plan to concentrate on more efficient management of our supply chain through quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices 
nonetheless  we expect only a slight improvement in our gross margin percentage for compared to because of the impact of our new product offerings 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
overall selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in compared to in the significant components of selling  general and administrative expenses are as follows year ended december  research and development expense selling  advertising and promotional expense stock based compensation expense charge related to purchase and cancellation of employee stock options vendor settlements and credits professional fees and expense executive  sales and administrative staff payroll other total research and development expense 
we continue to focus on bringing new products  updates and improvements to current products to market 
our research and development expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase in was attributable primarily to efforts early in to complete the dvm product  which was plagued by delays and cost overruns 
we believe that our cost trends have improved substantially during the second half of because of our cost containment efforts and increased scrutiny of engineering resources by our new vice president of engineering who was hired in april he has effected changes to improve the efficiency and cost effective usage of engineering resources in the development of our new products  in particular the dvm  and the line extensions for our current products that we plan to bring to market during we employed a total of engineers at december   most of who are dedicated to research and development activities for new products 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in and in  illustrating our commitment to bringing new products to market and expanding our current product line 
we have active research and development projects on several new products designed for the school bus  mass transit  taxi cab  law enforcement and other markets  as well as upgrades to our existing product lines 
our research and development expenses increased during because of the substantial delays in the launch of our dvm product as our engineers focused on initial production and other technical issues of the dvm product 
during the third quarter  we successfully launched the dvm ultra and during the fourth quarter we launched the firstvu  which illustrates the positive results of our current research and development efforts 
our number of engineers devoted to research and development activities is expected to increase during as we accelerate several development projects 
therefore  we believe that research and development expenses for will be slightly higher than our levels  although we expect that such expense as a percentage of total revenues should remain steady or decline as our revenues increase 
we consider our research and development capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis 
selling  advertising and promotional expenses 
selling  advertising and promotional expense totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the largest component of selling  promotional and advertising expense is commissions paid to our independent agents that represent our sales force in the domestic market 
these agents generally receive a commission on sales ranging from to of the gross sales price to the end customer 
sales commissions totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of   which is attributable to commissions paid on the million plus turkish sale in commissions approximating  were accrued as commission expense owed to our international distributor relative to the turkish sale in sales commissions as a percentage of overall sales increased to during the year ended december   compared to during the year ended december   which is attributable to the commissions to this international distributor during promotional and advertising expenses totaled  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december   a decrease of  
the decrease is attributable to our hiring of a graphic designer in who designed and produced many of our sales brochures and promotional tools 
we have increased the number of trade shows attended during to  including both domestic and international venues 
we believe our increased presence at such trade shows will lead to higher revenues through new leads and product demonstrations 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease was primarily attributable to the separation agreement we entered into with our former vice president of engineering and production that included a provision under which we repurchased all of his vested and unvested stock options during april as a result  all remaining unamortized stock compensation expense related to such unvested stock options was expensed immediately in the second quarter as a charge related to the purchase and cancellations of employee stock options 
therefore  we had a reduced level of amortization related to such options in the third and fourth quarters of subsequent to the resignation 
normal amortization of these options did occur during the year ended december  charge related to purchase and cancellation of employee stock options 
charges related to purchase and cancellation of employee stock options totaled  and for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase was attributable to the separation agreement entered into with our former vice president of engineering and production  who resigned during april  as described above 
the one time charge totaled  and is included in charges related to purchase and cancellation of employee stock options for the year ended december  vendor settlements and credits 
we resolved a dispute with a vendor during august that resulted in an aggregate benefit to us of  we disputed the value of services and products delivered and invoiced to us 
the dispute was resolved through mediation prior to the filing of a lawsuit and resulted in us receiving a cash settlement of  plus the cancellation of  of account payables to this vendor 
we recognized an aggregate benefit of  during the year ended december   which was reflected as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses 
professional fees and expense 
professional fees and expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the legal fees during were related primarily to normal public company matters and the dehuff and z technologies  llc litigation matters 
during the legal fees were primarily related to the l mobile vision patent litigation and dehuff matters 
the dehuff and z technologies  llc matters have not been resolved and therefore we expect that the related legal fees will continue to impact us during the decrease in professional fees and expenses is primarily attributable to cost containment efforts related to intellectual property legal matters 
executive  sales and administrative staff payroll 
executive  sales and administrative staff payroll expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
this increase is attributable to increased payroll costs related to additional sales and marketing personnel  the vice president of strategic development hired in and a  performance bonus granted to our ceo during the year ended december   none of which occurred in effective january  we hired three new sales and marketing employees  including an international sales manager  an inside sales manager and a national accounts manager  to improve our sales and marketing infrastructure in anticipation of the new products being launched in and to increase our presence internationally 
during november  we also hired a salesman to cover europe and the middle east  all of which contributed to higher payroll costs in compared to other 
other selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease in was primarily due to cost containment measures implemented that resulted in lower facility related expenses  consulting  insurance  information technology and travel during we plan to continue our cost containment initiatives in and expect the improvement in our overhead costs to continue 
operating income loss for the reasons previously stated  our operating income loss was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decline of  
operating income loss as a percentage of revenues declined to in compared to in we expect that operating income will improve during  as our revenue and gross margins dollars increase through the sale of our dvm product and the launches of our new products and anticipated increases in funding to states  counties and municipalities from the federal stimulus funds  coupled with management s continued monitoring and control over selling general and administrative expenses 
interest income interest income declined to  in the year ended december  from  in the decrease in interest income was a result of our decreased average cash balances  coupled with a significantly lower average interest rate earned on such balances during the year ended december  compared to income loss before income tax provision benefit as a result of the above  we reported income loss before income tax provision of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decline of  
income tax provision benefit our income tax benefit was  for the year ended december   compared to an income tax provision of  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded a benefit for income taxes at an effective tax rate of compared to a provision at an effective rate of for we have approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards as of december  available to offset future net taxable income 
net income loss as a result of the above  for the years ended december  and  we reported net income loss of  and  respectively  a decrease of  basic and diluted income loss per share basic income loss per share was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  for the reasons previously noted 
the diluted income loss per share was and  respectively  for the same periods 
all outstanding stock options were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the year ended december  because of the net loss reported for the difference between basic and dilutive income per share for the year ended december  is attributable to the dilutive effect of shares issuable under outstanding stock options for those options where their exercise price was less than the average market price during the period 
liquidity and capital resources overall during and  we principally funded our operations internally through cash flow from operations and the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
prior to  we primarily provided for our cash requirements through private placements of our common stock  the issuance of term debt and a revolving credit facility with a bank 
in february  our bank renewed our operating line of credit through april with the same borrowing capacity of million 
this credit facility would provide us with short term liquidity if the need arises  provided that we continue to satisfy the facility s covenants requiring us to maintain a million tangible net worth 
as of december   we had working capital of  and we had no long term or short term interest bearing debt outstanding 
we have not had any interest bearing debt outstanding since may our recent operating losses  increases in accounts receivable  and elevated inventory levels led to deterioration in our cash and liquidity in compared to fiscal management is focusing on reducing inventory and accounts receivable levels to generate additional liquidity and improve our cash position 
we believe that our liquidity trends will improve during and that our current credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating needs for the reasonably foreseeable future 
management does not consider raising capital through an equity offering as a viable alternative to supplement working capital needs  given the levels of public equity valuations 
there can be no assurance that we could increase our credit facility or raise capital in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us if the need arose 
cash and cash equivalents balances as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of  a decline from a balance of  at december  summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections are the main elements of the  net decrease in cash during the year ended december  operating activities  of net cash used in operating activities  primarily from our net loss  an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
non cash charges to income  such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation offset the net cash used in operating activities 
in addition  our cash flow from operating activities was negatively affected by non cash deferred tax benefits during the period investing activities  of net cash used in investing activities  primarily to acquire equipment to expand our research  development and production capabilities and the costs to acquire patents on our proprietary technology utilized in our products 
financing activities  of net cash used in financing activities  representing the purchase of common shares for treasury  the repurchase of outstanding stock options and the related deficiency in tax benefit offset by the proceeds from stock options and the purchase of common shares for treasury 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an improvement of  the negative cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was primarily the result of our net losses  increased accounts receivable and payments on accounts payable offset by substantial non cash charges to income such as depreciation and amortization expense  stock based compensation and increases in inventory reserves 
our accounts receivable increased substantially as a result of the million plus turkish sale that was outstanding at december  we anticipate that we will increase revenues  return to profitability and decrease our inventory and accounts receivable balances during  thereby providing positive cash flows from operations 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in both and  we purchased production  research and development equipment and office furniture and fixtures to support our activities 
during and  we also incurred costs for patent applications on our proprietary technology utilized in our new products and included in intangible assets 
however  we decided not to pursue international patents during  which was a significant component of the expenditures on intangible assets 
financing activities during the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was  which is attributable to the purchase of common shares held in treasury in the amount of  the purchase of outstanding stock options for  and the related  deficiency in tax benefits  all of which was partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock purchase options of  during the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities totaled  during we received proceeds from the exercise of stock purchase options of  and the related excess tax benefit totaling  offset by the purchase of common shares for treasury of  we have not had any outstanding debt since may the net result of these activities was a decrease in cash of  to  for the year ended december  commitments we had  of cash and cash equivalent balances and net positive working capital approximating million as of december  accounts receivable balances represented  of our net working capital at december  we had an outstanding receivable related to our december turkish sale totaling  as of december   which is guaranteed by an irrevocable bank letter of credit 
we expect our outstanding receivables will be collected timely and the overall level will be reduced substantially during  which will provide positive cash flow to support our operations during inventory represented  of our net working capital at december  we are actively managing the overall level of inventory and expect that such levels will be reduced during  which will provide cash flow to help support our operations during in addition  in february  we renewed our revolving line of credit until april which provides for maximum available borrowings of  the renewed line of credit bears variable interest at the bank s prime rate less  with a floor of 
we believe we have adequate cash balances and available borrowings under our line of credit to support our anticipated cash needs and related business activities during among other items  the line of credit contains a covenant that we must maintain a tangible net worth as defined in the agreement of at least million as of december  and each quarter end thereafter 
our tangible net worth calculated in accordance with the bank s definitions as of december  is in excess of million 
capital expenditures 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures at december  lease commitments 
the company has several non cancelable operating lease agreements for office space and warehouse space 
the agreements expire at various dates through october the company also has entered into month to month leases 
rent expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  related to these leases 
the future minimum amounts due under the leases are as follows year ending december and thereafter license agreements 
the company has several license agreements whereby it has been assigned the rights to certain licensed materials used in the company s products 
certain of these agreements require the company to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products shipped containing the licensed material on a quarterly basis 
royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
following is a summary of the company s licenses as of december  license type effective date expiration date terms production software license agreement april  april  automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party 
software sublicense agreement october  october  automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party 
technology license agreement july  july  automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party 
limited license agreement august  perpetual may be terminated by either party 
during april  the company terminated a production license agreement  entered into in october and terminated its production software license agreement  entered into during october because of failure of the counter party to deliver the required materials and refusal to honor warranty provisions 
both of these terminations are now in dispute and the company has filed a lawsuit to enforce its rights and protect its interests pursuant to these agreements
