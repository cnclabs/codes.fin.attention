table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the five largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states  with a nationwide portfolio in excess of stations in markets  including san francisco  boston  seattle  denver  portland  sacramento and kansas city 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
net revenues are gross revenues less advertising agency commissions 
the revenues are determined by the advertising rates charged and the number of advertisements broadcast 
we maximize our revenues by managing the inventory of advertising spots available for broadcast  which can vary throughout the day  but is consistent over time 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by periodic reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  both nationally and in the regions in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national advertising  which is sold by an independent advertising sales representative 
local and national revenues include advertising on our stations  websites  the sale of advertising during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet  promotional activities and e commerce 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation and rental income from owned tower sites 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  programming and promotional expenses 
other significant expenses that impact our profitability are interest and depreciation and amortization expense 
our performance is based upon the aggregate performance of our radio stations 
the following are some of the factors that impact a radio station s performance at any given time i audience ratings  ii program content  iii management talent and expertise  iv sales talent and expertise  v audience characteristics  vi signal strength  and vii the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings and or revenues  and there are no guarantees that the modification or change will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the associated risks and uncertainties 
we strive to develop compelling content and strong brand images to maximize audience ratings that are crucial to our stations financial success 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations for the relevant periods represent the operations of the radio stations owned and operated by us  or operated by us pursuant to time brokerage agreements tba  and exclude those owned by us but operated by others pursuant to tbas 

table of contents under the heading same station considerations  we evaluate net revenues  station operating expenses and operating income by comparing the performance of stations owned or operated by us throughout a relevant year to the performance of those same stations in the prior year whether or not owned or operated by us 
in addition  another party commenced operation of certain tower sites as part of our plan to exit the operation of non strategic tower sites  which also impacted same station considerations when comparing the years with we use these comparisons to assess the effect of acquisitions and dispositions on our operations throughout the periods measured 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year acquisition on march   we acquired through an exchange agreement three radio stations in san francisco  california  that in increased our depreciation and amortization expense as we acquired certain intangible assets with lives of a short duration 
dispositions during  another party commenced operation of certain tower sites as part of our plan to exit the operation of non strategic tower sites  which decreased net revenues tower rental income and station operating expenses for same station considerations  but had marginal impact to our reported results of operations 
on july   we sold three of our eight rochester  new york  radio stations for net cash proceeds of million  which the buyer began operating on may  under a tba with us 
the results for these stations were reflected in discontinued operations 
on march   we sold  through an exchange agreement  three of our seven seattle  washington  radio stations that in resulted in a million gain on sale of assets 
on january   we sold an austin  texas  radio station for million in cash 
financing during the years ended december  and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  of notes and recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million and million  respectively 
our interest expense decreased due to i a decrease in interest rates  ii a decrease in our outstanding debt  and iii the redemption of a portion of our notes that had a higher interest rate than the average rate under our senior debt 
during the fourth quarter of  another party commenced operating certain of our tower facilities and we received million in cash that was reflected as finance method lease obligations due to our ability to participate in future profits from these towers 
other the income tax benefit in was favorably impacted by the passage of federal tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allowed us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years 
as a result  we reversed the federal portion of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a net operating loss carry forward as we now expect to recover million of previously paid taxes 

table of contents during the years ended  and  we recorded an impairment loss of million  million and million  respectively  in connection with our review of goodwill and broadcasting licenses 
please refer to note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for further discussion of the contributing factors to the impairment loss 
in  our income tax benefit on loss from continuing operations was negatively impacted by an increase to our valuation allowance of million to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets were also fully reserved in the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to the cumulative losses incurred by us since  which caused uncertainty as to the realization of the deferred tax assets in future years 
during  we recovered million from our insurance company for damages resulting from hurricane katrina 
during the first quarter of  we reviewed our carrying amount for the rochester assets then held for sale and determined that an impairment loss of million was necessary as a result of the status of our then ongoing divestiture process 
net revenues years ended december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change the recent economic downturn reduced demand for advertising in general  including advertising on our radio stations during net revenues declined in most of the markets where we operate stations 
those markets that were impacted the most by the decline in radio station net revenue dollars were the boston  seattle  sacramento  san francisco and portland markets 
economic conditions sequentially improved throughout and  based upon early indications for  this negative trend appears to be reversing  primarily due to the strengthening of advertiser demand 
as the economy and the advertising environment rebound  we would expect to compare favorably to prior periods 
same station considerations net revenues tower rental income in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted net revenues for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
net revenues tower rental income in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted net revenues for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
station operating expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the decrease in station operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues as described under net revenues as certain variable expenses decrease with a corresponding decrease in net revenues  and 
table of contents cost reduction initiatives that commenced during the fourth quarter of  including but not limited to reductions in workforce  the elimination of the k employer matching contribution and other cost reduction actions 
management anticipates that station operating expenses will increase in as net revenues increase and as most cost cutting measures were fully realized in early same station considerations station operating expenses in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted station operating expenses for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
station operating expenses in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted station operating expenses for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
depreciation and amortization expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions depreciation and amortization expense amount of change percentage change depreciation and amortization expense decreased in as the expense in was higher due to acquisitions during the first quarter of and fourth quarter of  which included certain amortizable assets with lives of a short duration 
corporate general and administrative expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change corporate general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in non cash compensation expense of million as a result of a decrease in the fair value of equity awards issued  and a decrease in legal expense of million associated with certain legal proceedings during which did not recur in the decrease in corporate general and administrative expense was offset by an increase in deferred compensation expense of million as our deferred compensation liability generally tracks movements in the stock market 
operating income loss years ended december  december  dollars in millions operating income loss amount of change percentage change the increase in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in impairment loss of million in connection with our review of broadcasting licenses and goodwill in as compared to the decrease was partially offset by a decrease in net revenues for the reasons described above under net revenues  net of a 
table of contents decrease in station operating expenses for the reasons described under station operating expenses  and a decrease in net gain on sale or disposal of assets of million as a result of the sale in of three of our seattle stations 
same station considerations operating income in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted operating income for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
operating loss in would have been higher by million if we had adjusted operating loss for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
interest expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates on outstanding debt in as compared to  a decline in outstanding debt upon which interest is computed  and the repurchase of our notes  which have a higher interest rate than the interest rate on the borrowings under our bank facility used to repurchase our notes 
we anticipate a reduction in interest expense associated with an expected reduction in outstanding debt in and a reduction in january of million in notional value of an existing fixed interest rate swap agreement 
this reduction could be offset by the impact of an increase in interest rates and fees associated with the amendment to our bank facility in the first quarter of loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit amount of change percentage change the net change was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income for the reasons as described above under operating income loss  a million increase in gain on the retirement of our notes  and a decrease in our interest expense of million for the reasons described above under interest expense 
income tax benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income tax benefit amount of change percentage change the income tax benefit in was favorably impacted by the passage of tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allows us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years 
as a 
table of contents result  we reversed the federal portion of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as we now expect to recover million of previously paid taxes 
the income tax benefit in primarily resulted from the elimination of deferred tax liabilities associated with intangible assets due to the recording of an impairment loss in of million 
the income tax benefit was offset by an increase to our valuation allowance to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets  as the cumulative losses incurred by us over the past several years caused uncertainty about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
the company s income tax rate for the year ended december  was not numerically relevant 
for the year ended december   our income tax rate was 
the tax rates for the years ended december  and were impacted by a decrease to the valuation allowance of million and an increase to the valuation allowance of million  respectively 
we estimate that our annual tax rate for  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  will be in the low range before any necessary adjustment to the valuation allowance 
we estimate that our rate in will be affected primarily by changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  adding facilities in states that on average have different income tax rates than states in which we currently operate and the resulting effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities  the effect of recording changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions  taxes in certain states that are dependent on factors other than taxable income  and the limitations on the deduction of cash and certain non cash compensation expense for certain key employees 
our annual effective tax rate may also be materially impacted by i regulatory changes in certain states in which we operate  ii changes in the expected outcome of tax audits  iii changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and iv changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to differences between book and tax bases of certain of our indefinite lived intangibles broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
under accounting guidance  we do not amortize our indefinite lived intangibles for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
the amortization of our indefinite lived assets for tax purposes but not for book purposes creates deferred tax liabilities 
a reversal of deferred tax liabilities may occur when indefinite lived intangibles become impaired  or are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
due to the amortization for tax purposes of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we expect to generate deferred tax liabilities in future periods without consideration for any impairment loss in future periods

table of contents depending on the consolidated leverage ratio consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated operating cash flow  we may elect a rate equal to a choice of the eurodollar rate plus fees that can range from to  or the base rate plus fees that can range from to  where the base rate is the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the eurodollar rate plus  and c the prime rate  during periods when the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds six times  we are restricted in our ability to take certain actions  including but not limited to  the payment of dividends and the repurchase of our stock  certain restrictions and limitations on acquisitions and investments  and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio that cannot exceed seven times in and which ratio decreases quarterly in to a ratio of six times 
as of december   we have million of unamortized deferred financing expenses outstanding related to the bank facility and we expect to incur estimated additional costs of approximately million in connection with the amendment 
our bank facility with a syndicate of lenders as of december   is comprised of i a revolver of million  of which million is outstanding as of december   and ii a term loan of million  of which million is outstanding as of december  the term loan reduces from and after september  in quarterly amounts starting at million and ultimately increasing to million 
the revolver provides us with funds for working capital and general corporate purposes including capital expenditures  and  except as limited under the amendment  any one or more of the following repurchases of class a common stock  investments  dividends and acquisitions 
the bank facility is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
in addition  the bank facility  as amended  is secured by a lien on all of our assets  other than our real property 
as of december   the undrawn amount of the revolver was million 
the amount available under the revolver is a function of covenant compliance at the time of borrowing 
based on our financial covenant analysis as of december   we would be limited to borrowings significantly less than the undrawn limit unless such borrowings were used to repay indebtedness or for transactions that increase cash flow for purposes of covenant calculation 
we plan to use the revolver and cash flow from operations to fund the amortization of the term loan 
the bank facility  as amended  requires us to comply with certain financial covenants which are defined terms within the agreement  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio that cannot exceed seven times in and which decreases quarterly in to a ratio that will not exceed six times prior to the amendment  the consolidated leverage ratio could not exceed six times  and a minimum ratio of consolidated operating cash flow to consolidated interest charges of two times 
management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants and leverage ratios and all other terms of the bank facility as of december  we believe that over the next months we will continue to maintain our compliance with these covenants 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the revolver will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements over the next months  including our debt repayments 
while our operating cash flow has been reduced from prior periods during the recent economic downturn  it has remained positive and adequate to fund our operating needs 
as a result  we have not been required to rely upon  and we do not anticipate having to rely upon  our revolver to fund our operations our ability to maintain compliance with our covenants will be highly dependent on our results of operations as the economy recovers from the recent economic downturn and  to the extent necessary  our ability to implement remedial measures such as further reductions in operating costs 
if we were to enter into an agreement with our lenders for covenant compliance relief  such relief could result in higher interest expense 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of our bank facility and the failure to negotiate and obtain any required relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all outstanding debt 
under these circumstances  the acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we may from time to time seek to amend our existing bank facility or obtain other funding or additional financing  which may result in higher interest rates 
amending our bank facility or obtaining other funding or additional financing prior to the expiration of the current agreement will be essential as the revolver will be due as a balloon payment upon the expiration of the bank facility on june  
table of contents the recent economic downturn reduced demand for advertising in general  including advertising on our radio stations during economic conditions sequentially improved throughout and  based upon early indications for  this negative trend appears to be reversing  primarily due to the strengthening of advertiser demand 
we anticipate that revenue trends will be positive in as the economy and the advertising environment rebound and we compare favorably to prior periods 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in of million in net revenues  net of station operating expenses  and a decrease in of million in prepaid and refundable taxes as we received million of state and federal tax refunds in and we expect to receive million in federal tax refunds in net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was mainly attributable to a net decrease in working capital requirements of million  primarily due to a million reduction in prepaid and refundable income taxes as we received income tax refunds in of million  a million reduction in outstanding accounts receivable  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily due to million that was accrued as of december   paid in  and that related to a settlement with the new york attorney general and an investigation by the fcc 
investing activities for the year ended december   net cash flows used in investing activities of million primarily reflect additions to property and equipment of million 
for the year ended december   net cash flows provided by investing activities of million primarily reflect million in net cash proceeds from the sale of a station in austin  texas  and million in net cash proceeds from the sale of three stations in rochester  new york  offset by cash used in investing activities for additions to property and equipment of million 
for the year ended december   net cash flows used in investing activities of million primarily reflect the purchase of radio station assets of million  and additions to property and equipment of million  offset by i million from the sale of investments  ii million from insurance recovery proceeds  and iii million from the reduction of station acquisition deposits and costs 
financing activities net cash flows used in provided by financing activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the cash flows used in financing activities primarily reflects the net repurchase of our notes after a discount of million 
for the year ended december   the cash flows used in financing activities primarily reflect the net repayment of debt including the repurchase of our notes of million  the payment of dividends of million and the repurchase of our common stock of million 
for the year ended december   net cash flows provided by financing activities primarily reflect a net increase in outstanding indebtedness of million  offset by the payment of million in dividends  the repurchase of million of our class a common stock  and deferred financing expense of million related to our new credit facility 
our former credit agreement our former credit agreement former facility consisted of a five year million as amended senior secured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that was to mature on august  the former facility was secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our owned 
table of contents subsidiaries and required us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios  which were defined terms within the agreement 
income taxes during the years ended december   and  we paid a nominal amount in income taxes as we have benefited from the tax deductions available on acquired assets  which are primarily intangible assets such as broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we anticipate that it will not be necessary to make any additional quarterly estimated federal  and most state  income tax payments for  based upon projected quarterly taxable income and our ability to utilize federal net operating loss carryforwards beginning with and certain state net operating loss carryforwards beginning with income tax refunds as a result of tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allowed us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years  we recorded million under prepaid and refundable income taxes as we expect to recover this amount in the first quarter of for income taxes we previously paid 
in  we received million in income tax refunds that was primarily comprised of million in previously paid federal income taxes as a result of a net operating loss carryback  and million in refunds related to federal and state estimated tax prepayments 
dividends previously  we have used a portion of our capital resources to pay dividends on a quarterly basis effective beginning with the first quarter of and ending with and including the third quarter of our board of directors has not declared any dividends since that time 
pursuant to our bank facility as amended during march  during periods when our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds six times  we will be prohibited from paying dividends 
any future dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors based upon the relevant factors at the time of such consideration 
share repurchase programs our most recent share repurchase program  which had million remaining in authorization for repurchases  expired on june  depending on market conditions and other factors  new share repurchase programs could be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
over the past several years  our board of directors authorized several programs to repurchase our class a common stock 
under these repurchase programs  we repurchased and immediately retired in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share  in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share  and in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
option exchange program in february  our board of directors approved an amendment to the entercom equity compensation plan to permit a one time option exchange program oep  which amendment was approved at the may shareholders meeting 
on april   we commenced the oep subject to shareholder approval by making an exchange offer to our eligible employees and non employee directors 
we offered such persons the opportunity to make an election to exchange all of their outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share for a lesser number of restricted stock units 
the exchange ratio under the oep was as follows 
table of contents option exchange ratio strike price options for rsus at least  but less than for or more for on may   following the may  expiration of our oep  we granted million restricted stock units in exchange for million options 
as a result of the oep  the number of restricted stock units that can be issued under the plan was effectively increased by million as all restricted stock units granted did not count against the restricted stock sublimit 
in addition  the number of awards that can be issued under the plan was effectively reduced by million as all options that were exchanged will not be available for re grant under the plan 
senior subordinated note repurchases on march   we issued million of notes due march  as of december  and  we had outstanding million and million  respectively  as we repurchased and retired  during the years and  million and million of the notes  respectively 
on march   we redeemed at par all of the remaining million notes outstanding 
interest on the notes  which were in denominations of  each  accrued at the rate of per annum and were payable semi annually in arrears on march and september effective march   the notes were callable at a redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the notes were unsecured and ranked junior to our senior indebtedness 
our notes also required us to comply with certain covenants that limited  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness and to make certain payments 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures in will be between million and million 
credit rating agencies effective for  we elected to discontinue our subscription to such ratings services 
on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s may evaluate our debt in order to assign a credit rating 
any future significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact our future liquidity by limiting or eliminating our ability to obtain debt financing 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years amounts in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations finance method lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total a our bank facility had outstanding debt in the amount of million as of december  the maturity under our bank facility could be accelerated if we do not maintain compliance with certain covenants 

table of contents b under our notes  the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain compliance with certain covenants or could be repaid in cash by us at our option prior to the due date of the notes 
on march   we redeemed at par all of the remaining million notes outstanding 
c the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of our bank facility and our notes 
finance lease obligations outstanding include principal and interest expense 
when our continuing involvement in this transaction ceases over a remaining period of months in the year  we expect we will discontinue finance accounting and instead treat our obligations under the accounting guidance for capital and operating leases 
also  we will recognize additional obligations included in the above table that cover lease payments for the period subsequent to the month period of continuing involvement 
the minimum term for each of the leases is years  which covers the period of continuing involvement and the period subsequent to continuing involvement 
for further discussion  see note  financing method lease obligations in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
a we have purchase obligations of million including contracts primarily for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees  equipment maintenance and certain other operating contracts 
b in addition to the above  we have million in liabilities primarily related to our obligation to provide a letter of credit 
included within total other long term liabilities of million are liabilities for unrecognized tax positions of million  which have been reflected in the above table in the column labeled as more than years as it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
please see note  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of deferred tax liabilities  including liabilities for unrecognized tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we had an outstanding letter of credit of million as of december  we enter into interest rate contracts collars and swaps to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
as of december   we had no other off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents market capitalization as of december  and  our total market capitalization was million and million  respectively  which was million more and million less  respectively  than our equity book value 
as of december  and  our stock price was per share and per share  respectively 
the difference in market capitalization versus equity book value can be attributed to i a partial recovery in our stock price as compared to recent historical averages  and ii a reduction in equity book value due to impairments to broadcasting licenses and goodwill during the past several years please refer to note  intangible assets and goodwill in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for a discussion of impairment losses in  and 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate our radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are subject to renewal every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
subject to delays in processing by the fcc  historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with the renewal of licenses 
inflation in  we were not significantly impacted by the effects of inflation on our radio station operating expenses  including wages and equipment  although the exact impact cannot be reasonably determined 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june   the accounting standards were amended for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity 
these amended standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest provides the entity with a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis  and require an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
these amended standards are effective january  we do not anticipate the adoption of these amendments to have any effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements which impacted  please see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an 
table of contents advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
our historical reserves have generally ranged between and of our outstanding receivables 
due to the recent economic downturn and its effect on our business and our customer base  our accounts receivable reserve has been in the higher range with a reserve of as of december  and higher than usual in the prior year with a reserve of as of if the financial condition of our customers or markets were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required 
our net income would be negatively impacted by per share basic and diluted  assuming a increase in our outstanding accounts receivable allowance of million as of december  assuming a full valuation allowance against any tax benefit 
contingencies and litigation on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of our tax rates we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
in and  we recorded full valuation allowances for our net deferred tax assets primarily due to our cumulative losses over the past three years 
as changes occur in our assessments regarding our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision is decreased in any period in which we determine that the recovery is probable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities requires us to account for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation of accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based upon its technical merits  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions  and review whether any new uncertain tax positions have arisen  on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  historical experience with similar tax matters  guidance from our tax advisors  and new audit activity 
a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period in which the change occurs 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates  as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
excluding discrete items of tax  changes in our valuation allowance and impairment losses  our tax rate over the past several years has varied between a range of high to low 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rate as of december   would be minimal as the tax would be applied to a marginal loss for the year 

table of contents valuation of share based compensation we determine the fair value of our employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock units with service and market conditions using a monte carlo simulation model 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represents of our total assets at that date 
we must conduct impairment testing at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired  and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
after an impairment expense is recognized  the recorded value of these assets will be reduced by the impairment recognized and this shall be the assets new accounting basis 
in and  we recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  for radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables include but are not limited to the risk adjusted discount rate used in the valuation of fair value  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market based upon market size and station type  the forecast growth rate of each radio market  including assumptions regarding each market s population  household income  retail sales and other factors that would influence advertising expenditures  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  the likely media competition within the market area  an effective tax rate assumption  and future terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
during the second quarter of  we completed the impairment test for broadcasting licenses and determined that the fair value of the broadcasting licenses was less than the amount reflected in the balance sheet for each of our markets  other than seattle  and recorded an impairment loss of million 
the prolonged economic downturn negatively impacted the radio broadcasting industry as advertising revenues continued to decline and expectations for growth over the next year were reduced 
the projected growth levels for the industry and for us were less than those originally forecasted for  which was the primary reason for further impairment to broadcasting licenses in the second quarter 
as revenues decline  profitability levels are also negatively impacted as fixed costs represent a large component of a radio station s operating expenses 
as a result  the asset base is particularly sensitive to the impact of continued declining revenues 
the methodology we use in determining our key estimates and assumptions for broadcasting licenses was applied consistently to each market each market s broadcasting licenses are a single unit of accounting 
as a result  the analysis for each market is the same 
of the seven variables identified above  we believe that the first three in clauses through are the most important to the determination of value 
the following table reflects these key estimates and assumptions since the most recent impairment test for broadcasting licenses in the fourth quarter of the table also depicts the range of operating profit margin and market long term revenue growth rates used for determining the fair value of our broadcasting licenses 
in general  when comparing between the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of the market specific operating profit margin range declined  and the market long term revenue growth rates were consistent  however  current period revenues were less than previously projected for 
table of contents second fourth quarter quarter discount rates operating profit margin ranges to to market long term revenue growth rates to to we believe all of our markets broadcasting licenses  except for one  are at risk for future impairment 
the methodology used in determining our key estimates and assumptions was applied consistently to each market 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our broadcasting licenses  these estimates and assumptions could be materially different 
if actual results for the industry are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  then we could incur additional impairments 
operating profit margins are defined as profit before interest  depreciation and amortization  income tax and corporate allocation charges 
operating profits are then divided by broadcast revenues  net of agency and national representative commissions  to compute the operating profit margins 
operating profit margins are projected based upon industry operating profit norms  which reflect market size and station type 
this assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations in a market  but is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor 
if the outlook for the industry s growth declines further  then operating profit margins would be negatively impacted  which would further impair the value of our broadcasting licenses 
the long term market growth rates are estimated from information available from industry sources  using historical and expected performance  which could be different in each of our markets 
each market s revenues were determined based upon this data and market revenues were forecast over a ten year projection period to reflect the expected long term growth rates for the radio broadcast industry and for each of our markets 
if the estimates used for the industry s growth are less than forecasted  then our broadcasting licenses could be further impaired 
the discount rate to be used by a typical market participant reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows for the broadcast industry and the same discount rate was used for each of our markets 
the discount rate is calculated by weighting the required returns on interest bearing debt and common equity capital in proportion to their estimated percentages in an expected capital structure 
the capital structure was estimated based upon data available for publicly traded companies in the broadcast industry 
the discount rate could be negatively impacted by reductions in the industry s forecasted growth rates that directly impact future cash flows 
if we were to assume a basis point change in our three key assumptions a reduction in the long term revenue growth rate  a reduction in the operating performance cash flow and an increase in the weighted average cost of capital used to determine the fair value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill during the second quarter of  the following would be the incremental impact

for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies  please see note  significant accounting policies  accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in our latest annual report on form k for the year ended december  note to the consolidated financial statements included with form k contains several other policies  including policies such as governing the timing of revenue recognition  that are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  but do not meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies because they do not involve subjective or complex judgments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank facility 
from time to time  we may seek to limit our exposure to interest rate volatility through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
if the borrowing rates under our libor loans were to increase above the rates as of december   our interest expense under our bank facility would increase by approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest benefit or interest expense associated with the use of outstanding derivative rate hedging instruments 
during the year ended december   the following derivative rate hedging transactions to fix interest on our variable rate debt were outstanding in the aggregate notional amount of million 
these rate hedging transactions are tied to the one month libor interest rate 

table of contents effective date that notional type fixed notional amount of notional effective libor expiration amount after hedge amount date collar rate date decreases decrease amounts amounts in millions in millions swap january  n a january  january  collar february  cap february  n a n a floor swap march  n a september  n a n a swap may  n a may  n a n a total the net fair value based upon current market rates of the rate hedging transactions is included as derivative instruments in long term liabilities  which is based upon the maturity dates 
our rate hedging transactions are tied to the one month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the fair value of the hedging transaction is affected by a combination of several factors  including the change in the one month libor rate and the forward interest rate to maturity 
any increase in the one month libor rate and or the forward interest rate to maturity results in a more favorable valuation  while any decrease in the one month libor rate and or forward interest rate to maturity results in a less favorable valuation 
the fair value of our derivative instruments outstanding as of december  was a liability of million  which was a million decrease in the liability as compared to the balance as of december  this positive change was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in the remaining period of each derivative instrument as the forward interest rate to maturity remained relatively flat 
our credit exposure under our hedging agreements  or similar agreements we may enter into in the future  is the cost of replacing such agreements in the event of non performance by our counter party 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counter parties 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counter parties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counter parties nonperformance 
our cash equivalents are money market instruments consisting of short term government securities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by government securities 
we do not believe that we have any material credit exposure with respect to these assets 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the quantity of advertisers  the minimal reliance on any one advertiser  the multiple markets in which we operate and the wide variety of advertising business sectors
