overview we are a diversified biopharmaceutical business dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of novel  mechanism targeted drugs to treat cancer and other serious disorders 
we are focused on delivering leading edge therapeutic management of cancer patients based on a clinical development pipeline of novel drug candidates 
our core area of expertise  and a foundation of the company since our inception  is in cell cycle biology  the processes by which cells divide and multiply 
we focus primarily on the discovery and development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing the quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
our clinical development priorities are focused on sapacitabine in the following indications acute myeloid leukemia  or aml in the elderly  myelodysplastic syndromes  or mds  and non small cell lung cancer or nsclc 
we have ongoing clinical programs in development which are currently pending availability of data 
once data become available and are reviewed  we will determine the feasibility of pursuing further development and or partnering these assets  including sapacitabine in combination with seliciclib  seliciclib in nsclc and nasopharyngeal cancer  or npc  and cyc in addition  we market directly in the united states xclair cream for radiation dermatitis and numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges for xerostomia 
our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology and we focus primarily on the development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing the quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
we are generating several families of anticancer drugs that act on the cell cycle including nucleoside analogues  cyclin dependent kinase or cdk inhibitors and aurora kinase vascular endothelial factor receptor or ak vegfr inhibitors 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently attempting to develop nucleoside analogues  cdk inhibitor and ak inhibitor drugs  we believe that our drug candidates are differentiated in that they are orally available and interact with unique target profiles and mechanisms 
for example we believe that our sapacitabine is the only orally available nucleoside analogue presently being tested in phase trials in aml and mds and seliciclib is the only orally available cdk inhibitor currently in phase trials 
although our resources are primarily directed towards advancing our anticancer drug candidate sapacitabine through in house development activities we are also progressing  but with lower levels of investment than in previous years  our other novel drug series which are at earlier stages 
as a consequence of our focus on sapacitabine clinical development and related cost reduction program  research and development expenditures for the year ended december  were reduced by million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents we have worldwide rights to commercialize sapacitabine  seliciclib and cyc and our business strategy is to enter into selective partnership arrangements with these programs 
taken together  our pipeline covers all four phases of the cell cycle  which we believe will improve the chances of successfully developing and commercializing novel drugs that work on their own or in combination with approved conventional chemotherapies or with other targeted drugs to treat human cancers 
our corporate headquarters is located in berkeley heights  new jersey  with a research facility located in scotland 
from our inception in through december   we have devoted substantially all our efforts and resources to our research and development activities 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit during the development stage was approximately million 
we expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical and pre clinical drug candidates 
our operating expenses comprise research and development expenses and selling and general and administrative expenses 
to date  we have not generated significant product revenue but have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements  registered direct financings  licensing revenue  interest on investments  government grants and research and development tax credits 
prior to october  our revenue consisted of collaboration and grant revenue 
we did not start recognizing sales from our commercial products until we have recognized revenues from inception through december  totaling approximately million of which approximately million is derived from fees under collaborative agreements  approximately million of grant revenue from various united kingdom government grant awards and approximately million from product sales 
we have also recognized amounts receivable from the united kingdom s tax authority  hm revenue customs of million for research and development tax credits since inception 
recent events on january   we announced that the nasdaq global market  or nasdaq  had notified us that we regained compliance with the minimum million market value of listed securities requirement and that we currently comply with all other applicable standards for continued listing on nasdaq 
on january   we completed the sale of  units in a registered direct offering at a purchase price of per unit to certain existing institutional investors of the company for approximately million in gross proceeds 
each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase of one share of our common stock 
the warrants have a five year term from the date of issuance  are exercisable beginning six months from the date of issuance and will be exercisable at an exercise price of per share of common stock

table of contents on january   the board of directors of cyclacel decided not to declare the quarterly cash dividend on the company s convertible exchangeable preferred stock  or preferred stock  with respect to the fourth quarter of that would have otherwise been payable on february  as previously disclosed  the board also did not declare the quarterly cash dividend with respect to the first  second and third quarters of to the extent that any dividends payable on the preferred stock are not paid  such unpaid dividends are accrued 
this is the fourth quarterly dividend that we have not declared and if we fail to pay dividends for at least six quarters whether or not consecutive on the preferred stock  the size of our board of directors could be increased by two members and the holders of the preferred stock  voting separately as a class  will have the right to vote to fill the two vacancies created thereby until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid in full  at which time such right is terminated 
during january and february  we issued  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million through the exercise of warrants

revenues the following table summarizes the components of our revenues for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands collaboration and research and development revenue product revenue grant revenue total revenue collaboration and research and development revenue is derived from several agreements under which the company provides compounds for evaluation for an agreed consideration 
no revenue was recognized under collaborative agreements during and product revenue is derived from the sale of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges following the align asset acquisition on october  during the years ended december  and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 

table of contents grant revenue is recognized as we incur and pay for qualifying costs and services under the applicable grant 
grant revenue is primarily derived from various united kingdom government grant awards 
grant revenue decreased by from  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this was as a result of finalization of a three year european union grant which concluded in the future this was the second full year of align product sales since we acquired align in october we expect to continue to grow the sales of align products in through the support of a small sales force infrastructure and marketing efforts 
we expect that grant revenue will decrease as we focus our expenditure on the advancement of sapacitabine  which is currently waiting to advance into a phase clinical trial  and away from grant qualifying research expenditure 
cost of goods sold years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands cost of goods sold total cost of sales represented and  respectively  of product revenue for the years ended december  and during  we included an inventory provision of approximately million based upon current inventory levels  expiration dates  and future sales 
excluding the inventory provision  the cost of sales for the year ended december  represented of product revenues and in the future we expect to maintain a similar margin level as we incurred in research and development expenses to date  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs  with particular emphasis on orally available anticancer agents and our research and development expenses have represented costs incurred to discover and develop novel small molecule therapeutics  including clinical trial costs for sapacitabine  seliciclib  sapacitabine in combination with seliciclib and cyc we have also incurred costs in the advancement of product candidates toward clinical and pre clinical trials and the development of in house research to advance our biomarker program and technology platforms 
however  during and  in response to changing market conditions  we extensively reduced or stopped expenditure on development and preclinical activities outside of our core focus on sapacitabine 
the benefit of these cost reductions was realized in and will be also be realized in we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses primarily include clinical trial and regulatory related costs  payroll and personnel related expenses  including consultants and contract research  preclinical studies and laboratory supplies and materials  technology license costs  and rent and facility expenses for our laboratories 

table of contents the following table provides information with respect to our research and development expenditure for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands sapacitabine seliciclib cyc other costs related to research and development programs  management and exploratory research total research and development expenses research and development expenses represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in research and development expenses is stock based compensation of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs decreased by  or approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  starting in september with our announced cost containment efforts  we reduced or eliminated costs of all programs other than the sapacitabine clinical trials  and as of result  the research and development costs were reduced by approximately million in from the sapacitabine program increased by approximately million due to the increase in clinical trial costs of running the aml and mds programs 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs decreased by  or approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the sapacitabine program increased by approximately million relating to the increased clinical trial activities  in particular the commencement of the phase trial in elderly aml in december  the expansion of the trial to explore myelodysplastic syndromes  as well as additional pre clinical efforts and product scale up 
this has been offset by cost reductions in other programs and cost savings from the workforce reduction in september to allow us to concentrate on the advancement of sapacitabine 
the increase in strength of the us dollar against the british pound has also contributed to lower research and development expenses being recognized on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the future following our reduction of expenditure in and in our non core research and development programs  we have concentrated our resources on the development of sapacitabine in three indications 
we anticipate that overall research and development expenditures in will be similar to levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include costs for sales and marketing operations  administrative personnel  legal and other professional expenses and general corporate expenses 
the following table summarizes the total selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses 
table of contents total selling  general and administrative expenses represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditure decreased by  or million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this was as a result of cost saving measures first established in september and then during the second and third quarters of the cost savings resulted from reductions in employment related costs of million  intellectual property expenditures of million  stock based compensation expenses of million  professional fees of million  investor relations of million  information technology costs of million and travel costs of million 
additionally  sales and marketing costs related to align in were reduced by million compared to  which included one time business launch costs not repeated in during  a charge for amortization of intangibles of million with no corresponding charge in was recognized as the intangible assets were impaired during the third quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditure increased or million to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december   primarily attributable to the sales operations of align 
included within the expense of million for the year ended december  are approximately million of costs in respect of the support and development of align s commercial operations and sales and marketing  reflecting the fact that is the first full year of reporting for the align business following its acquisition in october in addition  million of intangible asset amortization charges were recognized prior to the intangible asset impairment 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses is stock compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the future following our reduction in expenditure in and  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenditures in to remain at the same levels as in or be lower 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment the following table summarizes the goodwill and intangibles impairment charges for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands goodwill and intangibles impairment in september  the goodwill acquired in the xcyte transaction was written down in full and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in accordance with accounting standard codification  or asc  intangibles goodwill and other  or asc this impairment charge was identified through our annual impairment review process and was triggered primarily by a decline in our stock price that reduced our market capitalization below book value of the net assets of the xcyte reporting unit 
our reduced market capitalization reflected the general decline in the economic environment 
intangible assets acquired in the align transaction were also fully written down in september  in accordance with accounting standard codification  codification topic  entitled property  plant and equipment  or asc an impairment charge of approximately million was identified through our annual impairment review process and was recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
this one time non cash charge was triggered by a downwards revision of our projected net cash flows from product sales  required due to budgetary constraints experienced by health care providers and restrictions of the cost reimbursement regime 
as a result  the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets on september  
table of contents in december  goodwill allocated to our align reporting unit following the align acquisition was fully written down in accordance with asc  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million being recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
a further decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of caused us to perform an impairment analysis during december in determining the impairment charge  we considered the negative impact the current economic situation might have on sales growth expectations of the align products resulting in a downward revisions of projected net cash flows from product sales 
these factors caused the discounted cash flows for the reporting unit to be less than its carrying value on december  the future previously recognized goodwill and intangible assets acquired have been fully impaired as of december  restructuring charge the following table summarizes the restructuring charges for years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands total restructuring charge fiscal as compared to fiscal the restructuring charge decreased by or million from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in september  we announced a revision of our operating plan that concentrates our resources on the advancement of our lead drug  sapacitabine  while maintaining a core competency in drug discovery and cell cycle biology 
the plan initially reduced our workforce across all locations by people 
we recorded and paid approximately million of severance costs and million of accelerated depreciation for assets that will no longer be utilized 
in addition we have accrued a charge of million in respect of costs of exiting the lease of our redundant cambridge research facility 
during the second and third quarters of  we further reduced our workforce across all locations by an additional twenty six people  making a total reduction of fifty one people  or of our workforce  since september  totaling approximately million 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the restructuring charge decreased by or million from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in september  we announced a revision of our operating plan that concentrates our resources on the advancement of our lead drug  sapacitabine  while maintaining a core competency in drug discovery and cell cycle biology

we recorded and paid approximately million of severance costs and million of accelerated depreciation for assets that will no longer be utilized 
in addition we have accrued a charge of million in respect of costs of exiting the lease of our redundant cambridge research facility 
during the year ended december   there were no changes to the assumption and estimates underlying the restructuring liability associated with exiting the bothell facility 
in  we recognized a charge of million in respect of the lease 
as of december   the fair value of the remaining lease payments  net of estimated sub lease income was approximately million 

table of contents the future as of december   the restructuring liability associated with exiting the bothell facility was approximately million representing the present value of the remaining lease payments  net of estimated sub lease income 
the restructuring liability is subject to a variety of assumptions and estimates 
we review these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis and adjust the accrual if necessary 
these changes may be material 
as a result of the workforce reduction in september  and during the second and third quarters of  we vacated our laboratory facility in cambridge  england 
further revisions to our operating plan  if any  will be assessed as circumstances dictate 
other income expense the following table summarizes the other income for years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands payment under guarantee change in valuation of derivative change in valuation of warrants liability change in valuation of warrant foreign exchange gain loss interest income interest expense total other income expense  net fiscal as compared to fiscal total other income expense  net  reduced by approximately million from a gain million in to an expense of million in due to the reduction in interest income of million arising form lower yields available on lower average interest bearing cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million in the valuation of warrants liability and million in respect of a payment under guarantee related to our arrangement with scottish enterprise 
this increase in expense was offset by a reduction in foreign exchange losses of million in compared to the differences related to these items are explained further below 
change in valuation of derivative on november   the embedded derivative associated with the dividend make whole payment expired reducing the liability to and thus no further marked to market adjustments will be made with regard to this embedded derivative 

table of contents change in value of warrants the change in valuation of warrants relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february the warrants issued to the investors meet the requirements of and are being accounted for as a liability in accordance with asc accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
asc 
the value of the warrants is being marked to market each reporting period as a derivative gain or loss until exercised or expiration 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of approximately million in the change in the value of warrants 
for the year ended december   we recognized an expense of approximately million as the change in the value of warrants 
foreign exchange gain loss in conjunction with the operational review conducted by the company in september  the nature of intercompany funding was considered 
it was concluded that as repayment of intercompany loans is not expected in the foreseeable future  the nature of the funding advanced was of a long term investment nature and that the terms of the loans should be amended to reflect this 
effective october   intercompany loans ceased to be repayable on demand and have no fixed repayment date 
as a result of the change in repayment terms  from october   all unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans will be recognized in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of stockholders equity until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
for the year ended december  unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements recorded in other comprehensive income totaled million compared to million in as a result of this change only foreign exchange gains losses unrelated to the intercompany loans are recorded in income expense in the year ended december  which totaled million expense compared to a million of expense in of which million related to unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans charged to this category before the october  change offset by a realized gain of million on transactions in the year in respect of underlying operations 
interest income interest income decreased by approximately million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during  maturing short term investments were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents  being a more secure form of investment and providing greater liquidity 
as a result  these assets attracted a lower rate of interest 
this was compounded by a reduction in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments during as compared to interest expense interest expense decreased by million from million for year ended december  to million for the year ended december  for each of the years ended december  and  we recorded accretion expense associated with the bothell restructuring lease of million and million in on the consolidated statement of operations as interest expense 
a further million of accretion expense will be recognized over the remaining life of the lease to december the future the valuation of the warrant liability will continue to be re measured at the end of each reporting period 
the valuation of the warrants is dependent upon many factors  including our stock price  interest rates and the remaining term of the instrument and may fluctuate significantly  which may have a significant impact on our statement of operations 
as the nature of funding advanced through inter company loans is that of a long term investment in nature  future unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on such funding will be recognized in other comprehensive income until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
this will minimize the future impact of unrealized foreign exchange fluctuations on earnings 
a further accretion expense of approximately million associated with the bothell lease restructuring charge will be recognized over the remaining life of the lease through december

the decrease was a reflection of decreased income taxes available for recovery as a consequence of the lower eligible research and development payroll expenses in the united kingdom following the workforce reductions commenced in september and continued in the second and third quarters of fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable decreased by  or approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended to approximately million for the year ended december  the level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year but restricted to payroll taxes paid by us in the united kingdom in that same year 
the decrease was a reflection of decreased income taxes available for recovery as a consequence of the lower eligible research and development payroll expenses in the united kingdom in following the workforce reductions announced in september the future we expect to continue to be eligible to receive united kingdom research and development tax credits for the foreseeable future and will elect to do so  however as a result of our revised operating plan announced in september and the subsequent reduction in workforce in the second and third quarters of the amount of payroll taxes payable in future periods will be lower than in previous periods  restricting available income tax credits to that lower amount 
liquidity and capital resources the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures as at december  and december  december  difference difference in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments  available for sale total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments current assets current liabilities working capital 
table of contents at december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as compared with million at december  the lower balance at december  was primarily due to funding ongoing clinical trials  research and development  and to a lesser extent  sales and marketing activities 
current liabilities increased by  or million  to million at december  from million at december  of the million increase  million relates to the amount payable under guarantee to scottish enterprise as part of the amendment in july to the march agreement 
in addition  the accounts payable balance increased by million primarily related to the manufacture of clinical trial supplies 
this was offset by a million reduction in accrued compensation 
since our inception  we have not generated any significant product revenues and have relied primarily on the proceeds from sales of equity and preferred securities to finance our operations and internal growth 
additional funding has come through interest on investments  licensing revenue  government grants and research and development tax credits 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that existing funds together with cash generated from operations and recent financing activities are sufficient to satisfy our planned working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and other financial commitments for at least the next twelve months 
current business and capital market risks could have a detrimental affect on the availability of sources of funding and our ability to access them in the future which may delay or impede our progress of advancing our drugs currently in the clinic to approval by the fda for commercialization 
cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and is summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used by investing activities net cash provided by used by financing activities fiscal as compared to fiscal operating activities net cash used in operating activities decreased by million  from million in to million in our net cash used in operating activities significantly decreased primarily as a result of our cost reduction plan first implemented in september and then again during june of and the focus to advancing sapacitabine into a pivotal phase trial

the decrease of million in net cash used in operations was mainly due to downsizing of operations and the year on year change in working capital 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  amounted to million 
during the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities amounted to million 
during the year ended december   we purchased short term investments totalling million which was offset by maturities of million in short term investments and incurred cash expenditures of million for the acquisition of align on october  during  the proceeds from maturing short term investments were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents to reduce our risk profile 
in addition  the net proceeds from million of maturing short term investments were used to fund our operating activities 
capital expenditure was reduced to  for the year ended december  compared to expenditures of million for the year ended december  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by million  from a use of million for the year ended december  to a source of million for the year ended december  for year ended december   the net cash provided by financing activities related primarily to net proceeds received from the registered direct financing of million in july on december   we entered into a ceff with kingsbridge  which was subsequently amended on november   in which kingsbridge committed to purchase the lesser of  shares of common stock or million of common stock from us over a three years year period 
under the terms of the agreement  we will determine the exact timing and amount of any ceff financings  subject to certain conditions 
all amounts drawn down under the ceff will be settled via the issuance of our common stock 
we may access capital under the ceff in tranches as described below  with each tranche being issued and priced over an eight day pricing period 
kingsbridge will purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the ceff at discounts ranging from to depending on the average market price of the common stock during the eight day pricing period 
pursuant to the amendment to the ceff  we may  subject to certain conditions require kingsbridge to purchase shares of common stock at a price that is between and of the volume weighted average price for each trading day during an eight day pricing period 
additionally  we may access capital under the ceff in maximum draw downs of i of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down  with respect to the first draw down  ii of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down with respect to one draw down per calendar quarter beginning on february   and iii of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down with respect to all other draw downs 
finally  the interest rate applicable to any outstanding make whole amount as defined in the amendment that may arise out of the our failure to deliver draw down shares on time was changed from five percent per annum to a rate equal to the greater of i the prime rate of interest then in effect as published by the wall street journal plus three percent and ii ten percent 
during december and subsequent to the year end  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to kingsbridge under the terms of the ceff in consideration of an aggregate of million  of which million was received in and million in because we did not declare the payment of dividends on our preferred stock for several quarters during the fiscal year  we will not be able to use our registration statement on form s  which covers the shares subject to the ceff and therefore  we may not be able to access the ceff until such time as an effective registration statement covering such shares be in place 
in july  we sold our securities to select institutional investors consisting of  units in a registered direct offering at a purchase price of per unit for approximately million in gross proceeds 

table of contents for the year ended december   the net cash outflow for financing activities primarily related to the payment of our preferred stock dividend of million 
during the net cash provided by financing activities related primarily to gross proceeds received from the registered direct financing which raised million in gross proceeds  before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses of million 
in february  we sold approximately million units  each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and a seven year warrant to purchase shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per unit in a registered direct offering 
the purchase price for the shares and the exercise price for the warrants was per share  the closing bid price for our common stock on february  investors paid per warrant 
we issued  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
for the years ended december  and  the net cash outflow for financing activities primarily related to the payment of our preferred stock dividend of million and million  respectively 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
while we have generated modest product revenues from align product sales for the years ended december  and  we can not guarantee that we will generate any significant product revenues until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries and successfully commercialized 
we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with funds raised in january and february  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we can not be certain that any of our programs will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete the development and commercialize any of our product candidates currently in development  should they succeed 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities  the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic collaborations 
although we are not reliant on institutional credit finance and therefore not subject to debt covenant compliance requirements or potential withdrawal of credit by banks  the current economic climate has also impacted the availability of funds and activity in equity markets 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or make changes to our operating plan similar to the revision made in september in addition  we may have to partner one or more of our product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development  which would lower the economic value of those programs to us

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the judgments and estimates required by the following accounting policies to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales we have adopted the following revenue recognition policy related to the sales of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
we recognize revenue from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
as we offer a general right of return on these product sales  we must consider the guidance in asc  and asc under these pronouncements  we account for all product sales using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  revenue is not recognized upon shipment of product to distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price and deferred cost of sales at the cost at which those goods were held in inventory 
we recognize revenue when such inventory is sold through to the end user 
to estimate product sold through to end users  we rely on third party information  including information obtained from significant distributors with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers 
stock based compensation the company grants stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock to officers  employees  directors and consultants under the company s amended and restated equity incentive plan  which was amended and restated as of april  we also have outstanding options under various stock based compensation plans for employees and directors 
asc requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of grant date fair value for stock option awards is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the anticipated exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 

table of contents such value is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line attribution method 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
during the quarter ended march   we revised the forfeiture rates because actual forfeiture rates were higher than that previously estimated primarily due to the lapsing of stock option grants on the termination of employees 
the revision to past forfeiture estimates for the three months ended march  resulted in a reversal of stock based compensation cost recognized in prior years with a consequent net gain of approximately million on the consolidated statement of operations 
during the second and third quarters of  we reduced the scale of our operations  including a workforce reduction across all locations 
as a result  we recorded an expense of approximately million 
warrants liability february financing asc requires freestanding contracts that are settled in our own stock  including common stock warrants to be designated as an equity instrument  asset or liability 
under the provisions of asc  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value until exercised or expired  with any changes in fair value recorded in the results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no subsequent fair value adjustments are required 
we review the classification of the contracts at each balance sheet date 
pursuant to asc  since we are unable to control all the events or actions necessary to settle the warrants in registered shares the warrants have been recorded as a current liability at fair value 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million 
fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for changes in the valuation of the warrants liability 
goodwill and intangible assets we recorded goodwill in march with respect to the merger with xcyte and in october with respect to the acquisition of align 
in accordance with asc  we are required to test for impairment of goodwill  and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized  on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could indicate impairment and require us to perform impairment tests more frequently than annually include significant adverse changes in market and economic conditions  adverse regulatory action  unanticipated competition or significant adverse change in perceived revenue potential 
we are organized as a single operating segment with two reporting units  align and xcyte  to which goodwill was assigned along with relevant identifiable assets and liabilities 
to test for impairment  we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to their respective carrying values  including assigned goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting units exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with asc  business combinations asc 
the residual fair value after this allocation represents the implied fair value of the goodwill 
to the extent the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount we are required to recognize an impairment loss 

table of contents the fair value of our xcyte reporting unit is determined by the market value of our outstanding common stock 
however  the fair value of our align reporting unit is determined by using the income based valuation approach with respect to projected product sales 
the income based valuation measures the current value of the reporting unit by calculating the present value of its future cash flows using appropriate discount factors with regard to cost of capital experienced by entities of the same size and condition as us 
in september  the goodwill acquired in the xcyte transaction was written down in full and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in accordance with asc this impairment charge was identified through our annual impairment review process and was triggered primarily by a decline in our stock price that reduced our market capitalization below book value of the net assets of the xcyte reporting unit 
our reduced market capitalization reflected the general decline in the economic environment 
in december  goodwill allocated to our align reporting unit following the align acquisition was fully written down in accordance with asc  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million being recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
in determining the impairment charge  we considered the negative impact the current economic situation might have on sales growth expectations of the align products resulting in a downward revision of projected net cash flows from product sales 
these factors caused the discounted cash flows for the reporting unit to be less than its carrying value on december  impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc  when indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the potentially affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value of the related asset  which is generally determined based on the present value of the expected future cash flows 
measurement of fair value is determined using the income based valuation methodology 
the income based valuation approach measures the current value of an asset or asset group by calculating the present value of the future expected cash flows to be derived from that asset  from the perspective of a market participant 
such cash flows are discounted using a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for the use of funds  the expected rate of inflation and risks associated with using the asset 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized immediately and cannot be relieved at a later date 
intangible assets acquired in the align transaction were also fully written down in september  in accordance with asc an impairment charge of approximately million was identified through our annual impairment review process and was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
this one time  non cash charge was triggered by a downwards revision of projected net cash flows from product sales  required due to budgetary constraints experienced by health care providers and restrictions of the cost reimbursement regime 
as a result the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets on september  recent accounting pronouncements for information about recently issued accounting pronouncements please see note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events asc  which provides guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and investment credit ratings 
investment and interest rate risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to interest rate risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents of million are primarily invested in highly liquid money market accounts  and commercial paper  both of which have remaining maturities of days or less 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
pursuant to our investment guidelines  all investments in commercial paper and corporate bonds of financial institutions and corporations are rated a or better by both moody s and standard and poor s  no one individual security shall have a maturity of greater than months and investments in any one corporation is restricted to of the total portfolio 
to minimize our exposure to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term instruments and at december  we held no investments with a maturity in excess of one year 
due to the short term nature of our investments  portfolio diversification  and our investment policy we believe that our exposure to market interest rate fluctuations is minimal  liquidity is maintained and we do not have a material financial market risk exposure 
a hypothetical change in short term interest rates from those in effect at december  would not have a significant impact on our financial position or our expected results of operations  however we may continue to have risk exposure to our holdings in cash  money market accounts and cash equivalents  which may adversely impact the fair value of our holdings 
as of december   there were no indicators of credit risk impact to the valuation of our cash  cash equivalents or short term investments 
we do not currently hold any derivative financial instruments with interest rate risk 

table of contents foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations related to the operation of our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
at the end of each reporting period  income and expenses of the subsidiary are remeasured into us dollars using the average currency rate in effect for the period and assets and liabilities are remeasured into us dollars using either historical rates or the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period 
intercompany loans with this subsidiary are denominated in us dollars and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arising on these loans have been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations within the separate line item foreign exchange gains losses within other income expense up to september  during the year ended december   there were unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements of approximately million on intercompany loans due to the increase in the strength of the united states dollar against the british pound 
of the million  million is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations within the separate line item foreign exchange gains losses  within other income expense 
this has been offset by a realized gain of million on transactions in the year in respect of underlying operations  resulting in a net foreign exchange loss of million 
in conjunction with the operational review conducted by us in september  the nature of intercompany funding was considered 
it was concluded that as repayment of intercompany loans is not expected in the foreseeable future  the nature of the funding advanced was of a long term investment nature and that the terms of the loans should be amended to reflect this 
effective october   intercompany loans ceased to be repayable on demand and have no fixed repayment date 
as a result of the change in repayment terms  from october  all unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on intercompany loans are recognized in other comprehensive income 
this has restricted the unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements recorded in other income to million  with million recognized in other comprehensive income for the three months from october  to december  future unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans will be recognized in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of stockholders equity until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging 
we enter into certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies in respect of underlying operations and  therefore  we are subject to currency exchange risks 
during the years ended december  and  we realized losses of million and gains of approximately million on such transactions  respectively 
other differences on foreign currency translation arising on consolidation of million are also recorded as a movement in other comprehensive income 

table of contents common stock price risk in february  we issued common stock and warrants 
pursuant to asc  we recorded the fair value of the warrants as a current liability 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the change in fair value recognized in the financial statements during the years to december  and was a million gain and a million loss  respectively 
fair value of the derivative instruments will be affected by estimates of various factors that may affect the respective instrument  including our stock price  the risk free rate of return and expected volatility in the fair value of our stock price 
as the fair value of this derivative may fluctuate significantly from period to period  the resulting change in valuation may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in december and amended in november  we entered into a ceff with kingsbridge  in which kingsbridge committed to provide us up to million of capital during the next three years 
we may access capital under the ceff in tranches  with each tranche being issued and priced over an eight day pricing period 
kingsbridge will purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the ceff at discounts ranging from to depending on the average market price of the common stock during the eight day pricing period  provided that the minimum acceptable purchase price for any shares to be issued to kingsbridge during the eight day period is determined by the higher of or of our common stock closing price the day before the commencement of each draw down 
during december and subsequent to year end  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to kingsbridge under the terms of the ceff in consideration of an aggregate of million in funds received by us
