item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information in item above and our historical consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
overview and developments we are an independent energy company focused on the exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil in the united states 
our oil and natural gas reserves and operations are concentrated in two rocky mountain basins 
our corporate strategy is to internally identify prospects  acquire lands encompassing those prospects and evaluate those prospects using subsurface geology and geophysical data and exploratory drilling 
using this strategy  we have developed an oil and natural gas portfolio of proved reserves  as well as conventional and unconventional prospects  that we have the opportunity to explore  drill and develop 
our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by the success of our exploration and land leasing activity  the resulting production and reserves  oil and natural gas commodity prices  and the costs related to operating our properties 
during  kodiak drilled eleven gross wells and net wells and completed nine gross wells and net wells as producers 
two wells were waiting on completion at year end and have been completed during the first quarter of kodiak operated all of these wells 
four of the nine completed wells were drilled with horizontal lateral lengths greater than  feet and five were drilled with horizontal laterals less than  feet 
of the wells drilled and completed in  the first well was put onto production in the second quarter of as of december   we had estimated proved reserves of million barrels mbbls of oil and billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas with a present value discounted at of million 
our reserves are comprised of crude oil and natural gas on an energy equivalent basis 
we had crude oil sales of barrels per day and gas sales of mcf per day in this was an increase of for oil sales and for gas sales over the volumes sold in during  our revenues from oil and gas sales increased by million or to million 
this increase was due to a million increase in sales volume as a result of successful production on new wells in  partially offset by a negative effect of million  due to lower average prices realized in than in total oil and gas production expenses decreased to million in from million in of the million decrease in  million is attributed to well workover operations charged to expense during that we did not incur in our revenues are directly affected by oil and natural gas commodity prices  which can fluctuate dramatically 
the commodity prices are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
during recent years  including and  we have seen significant volatility in oil and natural gas prices 
during  we have seen oil prices steadily increase and natural gas prices remain depressed 
during  oil prices declined from record levels in early july of over per bbl to below per bbl in december  while natural gas prices have declined from over per mcf to below per mcf over the same period 
we believe that spot market prices reflect worldwide concerns about the global economy  producers ability to ensure sufficient supply to meet increasing demand amid a host of uncertainties caused by political instability  a fluctuating us dollar  and crude oil refining and natural gas infrastructure constraint 
prices we have received have varied widely depending on commodity and location of salespoints 
in  we experienced improving crude oil prices in the williston basin while in wyoming we elected to shut in gas production because of extremely low natural gas prices 
overall  
table of contents the average crude oil price we received during was per barrel versus per barrel in  while our average gas price received during was per mcf compared to per mcf in during  the company did not record any charges due to asset impairments 
in  our financial position and results of operations were affected significantly by an asset impairment related to the carrying value of our developed properties 
in  the value of kodiak s proved reserves as calculated quarterly throughout the year did not exceed the costs included in the full cost pool 
consequently the company recorded a cumulative asset impairment of million during outlook our board of directors has approved a capital expenditure budget of million for  the majority of which is allocated to oil and gas activities to exploit the bakken and three forks formations in the williston basin of north dakota and montana 
of the total capital expenditure budget  the company has allocated million to the drilling and completion of gross net kodiak operated wells in dunn county  north dakota  including the installation of associated surface facilities  million for seven gross net non operated wells in dunn county  north dakota  and million for three gross and net operated wells in sheridan county  montana and mckenzie county  north dakota 
our working interest wi ranges from to in the operated drilling program  providing flexibility within the budget in identifying suitable well locations and in the timing and size of capital investment 
the capital expenditure budget  both as to amount and allocation  is subject to market conditions  oilfield services and equipment availability  commodity prices and drilling results 
while we continue to explore opportunities to expand our acreage position our current budget is primarily allocated to drilling and completing wells 
if we identify acreage that meets our strategic requirements  we may re allocate our capital expenditure budget to permit us to complete a potential acreage acquisition 
alternatively  depending on the availability and terms of capital resources that may be available to us  we may increase our capital expenditure budget to allow us to acquire additional acreage 
we expect to fund our capital budget primarily from cash on hand  anticipated cash flow from operations and borrowings under a potential reserve based revolving line of credit that we anticipate will be available to us in the second quarter of if our existing and potential sources of liquidity are not sufficient to undertake our planned or revised capital expenditures  we may alter our drilling program  pursue joint ventures with third parties  sell interest in one or more of our properties or sell common shares 
there can be no assurance that any such transactions can be completed or that such transactions will satisfy our operating capital requirements 
if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  we would be required to curtail our planned expenditures or restructure our operations  and we would be unable to implement our original exploration and drilling program 
in february and early march  we completed the mc h and the mc h wells located in our moccasin creek area on the southwest portion of our leasehold 
the mc h well had an initial production hour test rate of  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
the mc h well had an initial production hour test rate of  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
we operate both wells and have a working interest and a net revenue interest in these wells 
we anticipate operating a two rig drilling program in the williston basin  principally on our acreage in dunn county  north dakota 
we are in the process of taking delivery of unit  for which we have a two year commitment on this rig 
kodiak took delivery of unit rig in november and that contract expires in the fourth quarter of unless we mutually agree to extend the contract 
in dunn county  north dakota  we currently have ten drilling pads approved by the bureau of indians affairs  which can accommodate from one to four well bores each 
we continue 
table of contents to develop our drilling program utilizing pad drilling which has proven to lower costs through fewer locations and by eliminating mobilization time between wells on each pad 
during  we drilled two wells off of four pads and one pad was drilled with a single well 
we are currently drilling three wells from a pad and are looking to drill four wells off of future pads during of the gross wells budgeted in dunn county  north dakota for  we expect to drill three wells with shorter laterals and expect the remaining wells to be drilled with longer horizontal laterals approaching  feet 
the majority of our production in the vermillion basin is from non operated wells 
currently  we have not allocated significant capital to this area as we anticipate being in a carried position for any exploratory capital expenditures in we expect one well drilled in to be reentered and horizontally drilled to evaluate the potential of the baxter shale interval 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the three years ended december   and for the years ended december  capital resources and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at end of the period net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash flow our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we have historically financed our operations  property acquisitions and capital investments from the proceeds of private and public offerings of our equity securities and  more recently to a limited extent  from cash generated from operations 
during  we did not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to sustain our capital expenditure budget 
we issued equity during  resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million 
as of december   we had working capital of million as compared to million at december   and no outstanding long term debt 
our working capital as of december  included million of cash and million of prepaid tubular goods to be used in our drilling program 
we expect to fund our capital budget primarily from cash on hand  anticipated cash flow from operations and borrowings under a potential reserve based revolving line of credit that we anticipate will be available to us in the second quarter of if our existing and potential sources of liquidity are not sufficient to undertake our planned or revised capital expenditures  we may alter our drilling program  pursue joint ventures with third parties  sell interest in one or more of our properties or sell common shares 
there can be no assurance that any such transactions can be completed or that such transactions will satisfy our operating capital requirements 
if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  we would be required to curtail our planned expenditures or restructure our operations  and we would be unable to implement our original exploration and drilling program 
our increase in cash from operations during is directly related to our successful drilling and completion operations accomplished during our production and resulting revenue has increased as each well comes on to production 
the decrease in cash from operations during was primarily from our workover activities on three wells which decreased our sales volumes and increased our operating expense 
during  we charged approximately million of workover expense to lease 
table of contents operating expense  resulting in decreased cash flow 
the oil and gas revenue decrease in from was primarily due to a decrease in oil sales volume 
our investing activities during the three years ended december  related primarily to the addition of oil and gas leases and oil and gas drilling activities 
we recorded approximately million in development  exploration and tubular purchase costs in  million in and million in the remaining investing activity during  and consisted primarily of equipment additions and changes in our restricted investments 
our financing activities in consisted of two equity offerings of our common stock 
in may  we issued  shares of common stock through a registered direct offering for gross proceeds of approximately million 
in october  we issued  shares of common stock through a public offering for gross proceeds of approximately million 
under our planned drilling and exploration program  the company anticipates that our capital expenditures in the williston basin will be approximately million 
while we cannot fully assess our capital expenditures or the timing of expenditures in the vermillion basin as we do not operate the properties  we expect one well drilled in to be reentered and horizontally drilled to evaluate the potential of the baxter shale interval 
however  the company is carried on these costs under our amendment to our exploration and development agreement with devon  effective august  as we operate the majority of our acreage  specifically the williston acreage  we have the ability to adjust our drilling schedule to reflect the changing commodity price environment 
should we sell off some of our acreage and give up the right to operate  we will become subject to obligations imposed by others  without the ability to control our drilling schedule 
since we had not drawn against our credit facility the credit facility with bank of the west  na botw at december   our primary obligations at year end are our office lease and our two drilling rig contracts 
during the second quarter of  we entered into two year contracts for the use of two new build drilling rigs 
the first rig was placed into operation in november and entails a two year drilling commitment or specific termination fees if drilling activity is cancelled  and expires in agreement terms require utilization of the rig and payment of day rates or the payment of standby rates if the rig is not utilized 
the estimated termination fee for the first rig is approximately million as of december  the termination fee on the first rig will continue to decrease as long as the rig remains active 
we anticipate placing the second rig into operation in late march this rig entails a two year drilling commitment or specific termination fees if drilling activity is cancelled 
agreement terms require utilization of the rig and payment of day rates or the payment of standby rates if the rig is not utilized 
the estimated termination fee for the second rig is approximately million as of december  the termination fee on the second rig will continue to decrease as long as the rig remains active 
on september   our wholly owned subsidiary  kodiak oil gas usa inc our subsidiary  executed a million credit facility with botw 
borrowings made under the credit facility were guaranteed by us and secured by mortgages on substantially all of our producing oil and gas properties 
the credit facility also provided for letters of credit that could be used for general corporate purposes and included a commitment by our subsidiary to enter into an isda master agreement with botw that would govern hedging transactions the isda agreement 
on march   our subsidiary elected to terminate the credit facility and the isda agreement in order to permit us to establish our new credit facility with a lender on terms that would include our bakken properties within the borrowing base 
the termination of the credit facility and of the isda agreement will be effective as of march  in connection with the termination  our guarantee to botw all of the obligations of our subsidiary under the credit facility and the other 
table of contents loan documents also terminated 
there were no revolving loans outstanding  and we will not incur any penalties for early termination 
we have entered into discussions with several financial institutions with the intention of establishing a reserve based revolving line of credit 
we are currently evaluating several term sheets and believe that we will enter into a line of credit with a financial institution in the second quarter of we cannot assure you  however  that a credit facility will be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we borrow funds under a new credit agreement  we will be obligated to make periodic interest or other debt service payments and may be subject to additional restrictive covenants 
the ability to borrow funds is dependent on a number of variables  including our proved reserves  and assumptions regarding the price at which oil and natural gas can be sold 
should we seek to raise additional capital through the issuance and sale of equity securities  the sales  if successfully completed  may be at prices below the market price of our stock  and our shareholders may suffer significant dilution 
operating results fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  oil sales revenues 
oil sales revenues increased by  to  for the year ended december  as compared to oil sales of  for the year ended december  our oil sales volume increased in as compared to oil sales volumes were  bbl for the year ended december   as compared to  bbl for the same period in the increased revenue in was attributable to the positive impact of increased volumes of oil sales  offset in part by lower commodity prices 
the average price we realized on the sale of our oil decreased from per barrel for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas sales revenues decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was per mcf in compared to per mcf in this decline in natural gas prices realized resulted in a  decline in natural gas revenue in as compared to natural gas sales volumes were  mcf for the year ended december   compared to  mcf for the same period in this increase in natural gas volumes partially offset the decline in natural gas revenue by  interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased by  to  in from  for the same period in due to both a decrease in average investible cash throughout the year and lower interest rate paid for funds held with our banks 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in the decrease is primarily due to workover expense of  recorded in which was partially offset by additional production expense attributable to each new well coming on to production during depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dda expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense decreased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in although increased production volumes impact dda by increasing cost on a units of production basis  due to impairment charges taken in  the full cost pool was lower resulting in a lower dda rate charged for 
table of contents asset impairment 
there were no asset impairment charges during during the last half of  crude oil and natural gas prices dropped from their highs set in the summer of and the company s full cost pool exceeded the ceiling by approximately million after taking into account decrease in prices following the period ends 
subsequent to the end of the third and fourth quarters of  there was no recovery in price and therefore impairment expenses of million and million were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in excluding the non cash stock based compensation expense in each period our general and administrative expenses increased by  or during as compared to the same period in we recorded lower stock based compensation expense of  for the year ended december  compared to  recorded for the same period in  related to options and restricted stock issued to officers  directors and employees 
the reduction in the stock based compensation expense is due in part to the reversal recorded of non vested performance based stock options that expired as of march  stock based compensation expense related to the expired performance based stock options was approximately  additionally  on december  certain officers and directors voluntarily cancelled stock options issued in the unamortized expense related to these cancelled options of approximately  was recognized in stock based compensation expense as of december  net loss 
our net loss improved or decreased by  to a net loss of  for the year ended december   from a net loss of  for as more fully described above  the asset impairment of  in was the primary cause of the decrease in net loss from in addition  our increased oil production and resulting oil revenue contributed to the improvement or decrease in net loss 
adjusted ebitda 
our adjusted ebitda increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of as shown in the following table  this increase is the primarily the result of increased revenues from increased oil and gas production

oil sales revenues decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for this decrease is attributed to a  negative impact due to a decrease in volume offset and by a  positive impact due to a increase in average price 
during the second and third quarter of  three operated oil wells were shut in pending workover and completion activities 
this contributed to the decline in our oil sales 
table of contents volumes to  barrels for compared to  barrels for the same period in  whereas the average price we realized on the sale of our oil increased to per barrel for the year ended december   from for the same period in natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas sales revenues increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of  of the increase was due to a increase in volume and  of the increase was due to a increase in average price 
natural gas sales volumes were  mcf for the year ended december   compared to  mcf for the same period in and the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was per mcf in compared to per mcf in during the fourth quarter of  natural gas prices in wyoming declined to a level that we decided to shut in our wyoming operated wells until prices improve 
interest income 
interest income decreased by  to  in from  for the same period in due to a decrease in average investible cash throughout the year 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in the increase is primarily due to workover expense of  recorded during the year 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dda expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense decreased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in due to impairment charges taken in and  the full cost pool was lower resulting in a lower dda charge for asset impairment 
during the last half of  crude oil and natural gas prices dropped from their highs set in the summer of and the company s full cost pool exceeded the ceiling by approximately million after taking into account decrease in prices following the period ends 
subsequent to the end of the third and fourth quarters of  there was no recovery in price and therefore impairment expenses of million and million were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
in  we recorded an impairment of million primarily as the result of our inability to establish production and qualified reserves in its deep vermillion basin project  uneconomic natural gas prices in wyoming  and the impairment of certain undeveloped properties in wyoming and north dakota 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in included in the general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended december  is a stock based compensation charge of  for options issued to officers  directors and employees compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   also reflects an increase in our level of activity and an increase in the number of employees 
as of december   we had full time employees and two contract consultants as compared to full time employees and three contract consultants at december  salary and related expenses decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  in this decrease is due to the reduction in employee bonuses in versus  partially offset by the addition of two new employees in also included in general and administrative expense is our gain on currency exchange 
in  a decrease in the value of the canadian dollar resulted in a loss of  on currency exchange as compared to a gain in of  
table of contents net loss 
our net loss increased by  to a net loss of  for the year ended december   from a net loss of  for as more fully described above  the asset impairment of  in was the primary cause of the increase as compared to an asset impairment charge of  in in addition  the decrease in oil production revenue  interest income and the increase in oil and gas production expense contributed to the increase in net loss 
adjusted ebitda 
our adjusted ebitda decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of as shown in the following table  this decrease is the primarily the result of decreased revenues and increased production and general and administrative expenses

for the year ended december  change oil and gas production revenues interest revenue total revenue oil and gas production expense general and administrative expense excluding stock compensation adjusted ebitda financial instruments and other instruments as at december   we had cash  accounts payable and accrued liabilities which are carried at approximate fair value because of the short maturity date of those instruments 
our management believes that we are not exposed to significant interest  currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments 
research and development as an exploration stage natural resource company  we do not normally engage in research and there were no development activities  or research and development expenditures made in the last three fiscal years 
trend information during  commodity prices stabilized from the historic volatility experienced during with oil currently near per barrel  drilling activity in certain areas  including near our operating areas  has increased over the low activity we experienced in early currently  qualified employees are available  however we still must compete for employees within our industry 
some or all of these situations are likely to have a material effect upon our net sales or revenues  income from continuing operations  profitability  liquidity or capital resources  or cause reported financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents subsequent event commodity derivative agreement in february  the company entered into its first commodity derivative contract 
we utilized a no premium collar to hedge the effect of price changes on a portion of its future oil production 
the objective of our hedging activity and the use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows 
while the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
as we develop our hedging strategy  we may  from time to time  opportunistically restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to effectively modify the terms of current contracts in order to improve the pricing parameters in existing contracts or realize the current value of the company s existing positions and use the proceeds from such transactions to secure additional contracts for periods in which the company believes it has additional commodity price risk 
the use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
the company s derivative contract is currently with a single counterparty 
the company has netting arrangements with the counterparty that provides for the offset of payables against receivables from separate derivative arrangements with that counterparty in the event of contract termination 
the derivative contracts may be terminated by a non defaulting party in the event of default by one of the parties to the agreement 
our commodity derivative contract entered into during february is summarized below contract type counterparty basis quantity bbl d strike price bbl term collar bp north america nymex mar dec  contractual obligations the following table lists as of december   information with respect to our known contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term obligations office facilities drilling rig obligations during the second quarter of  the company entered into two year contracts for the use of two new build drilling rigs  which are described in this section under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
we have not included asset retirement obligations as discussed in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  as we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires our management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 

table of contents oil and natural gas reserves we follow the full cost method of accounting 
all of our oil and gas properties are located within the united states  and therefore all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves less the future cash outflows associated with the asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  impairment would be recognized 
under the new sec rules  we prepared our oil and gas reserve estimates as of december  using the average  first day of the month price during the month period ending december  in prior years through september   we used the year end or quarter ended price 
prior to december   subsequent commodity price increases could be utilized to calculate the ceiling value 
estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
we believe estimated reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows are the most important estimates made by an exploration and production company such as ours because they affect the perceived value of our company  are used in comparative financial analysis ratios  and are used as the basis for the most significant accounting estimates in our financial statements  including the quarterly calculation of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
we determine anticipated future cash inflows and future production and development costs by applying benchmark prices and costs  including transportation  quality and basis differentials  in effect at the end of each quarter to the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas remaining to be produced as of the end of that quarter 
we reduce expected cash flows to present value using a discount rate that depends upon the purpose for which the reserve estimates will be used 
for example  the standardized measure calculation required by asc topic  extractive activities oil and gas  requires us to apply a discount rate 
although reserve estimates are inherently imprecise  and estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than those of established proved producing oil and natural gas properties  we make considerable effort to estimate our reserves  including through the use of independent reserves engineering consultants 
we expect that quarterly reserve estimates will change in the future as additional information becomes available or as oil and natural gas prices and operating and capital costs change 
we evaluate and estimate our oil and natural gas reserves as of december of each year and at each quarter throughout the year 
for purposes of depletion  depreciation  and impairment  we adjust reserve quantities at all quarterly periods for the estimated impact of acquisitions and dispositions 
changes in depletion  depreciation or impairment calculations caused by changes in reserve quantities or net cash flows are recorded in the period in which the reserves or net cash flow estimate changes 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we record our property and equipment at cost 
the cost of our unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until such a time as the properties are either developed or abandoned 
we review these properties quarterly for possible impairment 
we provide an impairment allowance on unproved property when we determine that the property will not be developed or the carrying value will not be realized 
we evaluate the reliability of our proved properties and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recording of impairment may be appropriate 
our impairment test compares the expected undiscounted future net revenue from a property  using escalated pricing  with the related net capitalized costs of the property at the end of the applicable period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenue of a property  the cost of the property is added to the full cost pool 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and of the forward looking statements contained in our analysis of liquidity and capital resources 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil 
we report revenue as the gross amounts we receive before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs  which are reported as separate expenses 
we record revenue in the month our production is delivered to the purchaser  but payment is generally received to days after the date of production 
at the end of each month  we make estimates of the amount of production that we delivered to the purchaser and the price we will receive 
we use our knowledge of our properties  their historical performance  the anticipated effect of weather conditions during the month of production  nymex and local spot market prices and other factors as the basis for these estimates 
we record the variances between our estimates and the actual amounts we receive in the month payment is received 
asset retirement obligations we are required to recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties including without limitation the costs of reclamation of our drilling sites  storage and transmission facilities and access roads 
we base our estimate of the liability on the industry experience of our management and on our current understanding of federal and state regulatory requirements 
our present value calculations require us to estimate the economic lives of our properties  assume what future inflation rates apply to external estimates and determine the credit adjusted risk free rate to use 
our estimated asset retirement obligations are reflected in our depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations over the remaining life of our oil and gas properties 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of asc topic this guidance requires us to record expense associated with the fair value of stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate stock based compensation 
oil and natural gas properties full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
we record all capitalized cost into a single cost center as all operations are conducted within the united states 
these costs include land acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenses  carrying charges on non producing properties  costs of drilling and overhead charges directly related to acquisition and exploration activities 

table of contents capitalized costs  together with the costs of production equipment  are depleted and amortized on the unit of production method based on the estimated gross proved reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
for this purpose  we convert our petroleum products and reserves to a common unit of measure 
costs of acquiring and evaluating unproved properties are initially excluded from depletion calculations 
these unevaluated properties are assessed quarterly to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
when proved reserves are assigned or the property is considered to be impaired  the cost of the property or the amount of the impairment is added to the full cost pool and becomes subject to depletion calculations 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are applied against capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless the sale would alter the rate of depletion by more than 
royalties paid  net of any tax credits  received are netted against oil and natural gas sales 
in applying the full cost method  we perform a ceiling test on properties that restricts the capitalized costs less accumulated depletion from exceeding an amount equal to the estimated undiscounted value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
the estimated future revenues are based on sales prices achievable under existing contracts and posted average reference prices in effect at the end of the applicable period  and current costs  and after deducting estimated future general and administrative expenses  production related expenses  financing costs  future site restoration costs and income taxes 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and natural gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  we would recognize an impairment 
foreign currency fluctuations monetary items denominated in a foreign currency  other than us dollars  are converted into us dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date 
foreign currency denomination revenue and expense items are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date 
gains or losses arising from the translations are included in operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our primary market risk consists of market changes in oil and natural gas prices 
prospective revenues from the sale of products or properties will be impacted by oil and natural gas prices
