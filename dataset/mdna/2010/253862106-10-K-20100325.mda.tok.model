during the year ended december   sales of our products decreased significantly from the prior year 
we intend to remain an innovative leader in the development of cutting edge custom power solutions  high grade  high density  modular power systems and rugged power solutions to meet harsh and extreme environmental requirements 
we also intend to continue to pursue our strategy to reduce production costs and deliver high quality products in a timely manner through production agreements with numerous contract manufacturers in asia 
our revenues have decreased and are not sufficient to offset our expenses  and we may be subject to net losses in a given quarter 
however  we believe that our cash will be sufficient to fund any such losses for at least months 
foreign currency fluctuations our wholly owned subsidiary  dpl  operates using the united kingdom pound sterling 
therefore  we are subject to monetary fluctuations between the us dollar and the united kingdom pound sterling 
for the year ended december   we recorded a foreign currency translation loss of  in other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity

actual results could differ from those estimates 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december   revenues decreased by to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues is mainly due to a decline in sales of our standard commercial products as a result of the global economic recession  as described below

gross margins gross margins were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the higher gross margins in were primarily attributable to the continued outsourcing of our production to contract manufacturers in asia  cost reductions and variations in our product mix 
we believe that some of our business may be of a seasonal nature and that it most likely will not signify similar increases in gross margin in the future

the change in financial results was due to foreign currency fluctuations during the respective periods and changes in the fair value of forward contracts 
net loss the net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net income of  for the year ended december  the loss for the year ended december  is due primarily to the slowdown in the global economy which resulted in a significant decrease in our revenues 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following are considered our most critical accounting policies that  under different conditions or using different assumption or estimates  could show materially different results on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred when risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer  the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders and contracts to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue on shipments to distributors and resellers is recognized on delivery 
generally  we do not grant a right of return 
however  allowances are provided for stock rotation rights that are granted to distributors in accordance with their respective arrangements 
inventory obsolescence accruals we periodically assess our inventory valuation by reviewing revenue forecasts and technological obsolescence 
we write down the value of obsolete or unmarketable inventory to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during and  we recorded inventory write offs of  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers located primarily in the us and europe 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and currently require no collateral from our customers 
an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses is maintained in anticipation of the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was  and  respectively 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  such as the result of bankruptcy or deterioration of the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of customers  and if the condition or circumstances of our customers deteriorates  estimates of the recoverability of trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if our estimates are determined to be greater than the actual amounts necessary  we may decrease a portion of such allowance in future periods based on actual collection experience 
other accrued liabilities our accrued liabilities are based on a variety of factors including past experience and  in many cases  require estimates if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
equity based compensation expense we account for equity based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires the exercise of judgment  including the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical pre vesting forfeitures 
if actual results differ from these estimates  equity based compensation expense  and therefore our results of operations  could be impacted 
the company estimates the fair value of stock options granted under asc using the black scholes option pricing model  which uses the following assumption expected volatility is based on historical volatility  which is representative of future volatility over the expected term of the options 
the expected term of options granted was determined based on the simplified method  which is calculated as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of u 
s treasury bonds with equivalent terms 
the dividend yield is based on the company s historical and future expectation of dividends payouts 
the company has not paid cash dividends historically and has no plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources on december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of  and working capital of  this compares to cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of  and working capital of  on december  the increase in working capital in is mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents  an increase in other accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable and related parties trade payables  offset partially by a decrease in inventory  a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in advances from customers and deferred revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was mainly due to a net loss of  in and a decrease in accounts payable and related parties trade payables  offset by a decrease in inventories and an increase in advances from customers and deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in investing activities in was mainly due to reduced purchases of property and equipment during and a decrease in a short term deposit investment 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was  cash provided by financing activities in was due to proceeds from the exercise of options 
no cash was provided by financing activities in the year ended december  our liquidity will be affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
as evidenced by the recent turmoil in the financial markets  credit has tightened 
we are reviewing our liabilities and capital structure to minimize any impact  and will pursue a strategy to mitigate any reductions in cash flow as a result of an economic slowdown by reducing capital expenditures and other discretionary spending 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months
