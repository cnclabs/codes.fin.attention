oil and gas marketing and major customers marketing 
essentially all of our natural gas production is sold under spot or market sensitive contracts to various gas purchasers on short term contracts 
our condensate and crude oil production is sold to various purchasers under short term rollover agreements based on current market prices 
customers 
due to the nature of the industry  we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and  accordingly  amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant 
revenues from these sources as a percent of oil and gas revenues for the year ended december  was as follows louis dreyfus corporation shell energy crosstex energy competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
major and independent oil and gas companies  drilling and production acquisition programs and individual producers and operators are active bidders for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as the equipment and labor required to operate those properties 
many competitors have financial resources substantially greater than ours  and staffs and facilities substantially larger than us 
employees at february   we had full time employees in our two administrative offices and one field office  none of whom is represented by any labor union 
we regularly use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  particularly in the areas of construction  design  well site supervision  permitting and environmental assessment 
independent contractors usually perform field and on site production operation services for us  including gauging  maintenance  dispatching  inspection and well testing

index to financial statements regulations the availability of a ready market for any natural gas and oil production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of natural gas and oil production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  state limits on allowable rates of production by a well or proration unit  the amount of natural gas and oil available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or the lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of natural gas and oil  protect rights to produce natural gas and oil between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of natural gas and oil produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies as well 
environmental matters our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
compliance with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits before drilling commences  restrict the type  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling and production activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions that may limit or prohibit some or all of our operations 
the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition  there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental laws to which our business operations are subject and with which compliance may have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the sites where the release occurred  and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances released at the site 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liabilities for remediation costs at the site  natural resource damages and for the costs of certain health studies 
additionally  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
we generate materials in the course of our operations that are regulated as hazardous substances 
we also may incur liability under the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state statutes which impose requirements related to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
while there exists an exclusion under rcra from the definition of hazardous wastes for certain materials generated in the exploration  development or production of oil and gas  these wastes may be regulated by the us 
table of contents 
index to financial statements environmental protection agency the epa and state environmental agencies as non hazardous solid wastes 
moreover  we generate petroleum product wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as solid and hazardous wastes 
the epa and state agencies have imposed stringent requirements for the disposal of hazardous and solid wastes 
we currently own or lease  and in the past have owned or leased  properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years 
although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances  wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us  or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal 
in addition  some of our properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances  wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes  remediate contaminated property  or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
the federal water pollution control act  as amended  clean water act  and analogous state law  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances  into state and federal waters 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by epa or an analogous state agency 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
in addition  the oil pollution act of opa imposes a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills into navigable waters 
opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and several liabilities for specified oil removal costs and certain other damages including natural reservoir damages arising from a spill 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with the clean water act and opa requirements 
the disposal of oil and gas wastes into underground injection wells are subject to the safe drinking water act as well as analogous state laws 
under part c of the safe drinking water act  the epa established the underground injection control program  which establishes requirements for permitting  testing  monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of injection well activities as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water 
state programs may have analogous permitting and operational requirements 
any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater  potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well  issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies  incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource  and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injury 
in addition to the underground injection operations  our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance any production of natural gas from formations with low permeability  such as shales 
due to concerns raised concerning potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality  legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing 
such efforts could have an adverse effect on our natural gas production activities 
the federal clean air act  as amended  and comparable state laws  regulates emissions of various air pollutants from many sources in the united states  including crude oil and natural gas production activities 
these laws and any implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions  impose stringent air permit requirements  or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable air permitting and control technology requirements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in response to studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climate changes  president obama has expressed support for  and congress is actively considering legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases by establishing an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce us emissions of greenhouse gases 
in addition  more than one third of the states  either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
also  the epa has determined that greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment and  consequently  has proposed regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and could trigger permit review for greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources  as well as adopted regulations requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas sources in the united states 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such new federal  regional  or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance or operating costs or additional operating restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand for the oil and gas we produce 
the federal endangered species act and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa 
however  the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas 
state statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
in addition  there are state statutes  rules and regulations governing conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing  plugging and abandonment of such wells 
such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and gas could otherwise be produced from our properties and may restrict the number of wells that may be drilled on a particular lease or in a particular field 
we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local governmental authorities and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable osha requirements 
item a 
risk factors our financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
the following summarizes some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties which may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves 
we may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report 
these differences may be material 
the proved oil and gas reserve information included in this report are estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by nsai  our independent reserve engineers  and were calculated using the unweighted average of first day of the month oil and gas prices in these prices will change and may be lower at the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements time of production than those prices that prevailed during reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing wells  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material 
the discounted future net cash flows included in this document should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on month average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  increases or decreases in consumption  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  and which we use in calculating our pv  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
our estimates of proved reserves have been prepared under new sec rules which went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after december   which may make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future 
this report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of december   which have been prepared and presented under new sec rules 
these new rules are effective for fiscal years ending on or after december   and require sec reporting companies to prepare their reserves estimates using revised reserve definitions and revised pricing based on twelve month unweighted first day of the month average pricing 
the previous rules required that reserve estimates be calculated using last day of the year pricing 
the pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of december  was based on an unweighted average twelve month west texas intermediate wti posted price of per bbl for oil and a henry hub spot 
table of contents 
index to financial statements price of per mmbtu for natural gas  as compared to per bbl for oil and per mmbtu for natural gas as of december  as a result of these changes  direct comparisons to our previously reported reserves amounts may be more difficult 
another impact of the new sec rules is a general requirement that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
this new rule has limited and may continue to limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program  particularly as we develop our significant acreage in east texas and northwest louisiana 
moreover  we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill on those reserves within the required five year timeframe 
the sec has not reviewed our or any reporting company s reserve estimates under the new rules and has released only limited interpretive guidance regarding reporting of reserve estimates under the new rules and may not issue further interpretive guidance on the new rules 
accordingly  while the estimates of our proved reserves at december  included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the new sec rules  those estimates could differ materially from any estimates we might prepare applying more specific sec interpretive guidance 
our future revenues are dependent on the ability to successfully complete drilling activity 
drilling and exploration are the main methods we utilize to replace our reserves 
however  drilling and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including lack of acceptable prospective acreage  inadequate capital resources  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and gas prices  limitations in the market for oil and gas  title problems  compliance with governmental regulations  mechanical difficulties  and risks associated with horizontal drilling 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 
in addition  we recently completed drilling our sixth horizontal well in the etnl area 
we have only limited experience drilling horizontal wells and there can be no assurance that this method of drilling will be as effective as we currently expect it to be 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  while lower oil and gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  higher oil and gas prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs  equipment and crews and can lead to shortages of  and increasing costs for  such drilling equipment  services and personnel 
such shortages could restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned 
any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could adversely affect our ability to increase our reserves and production and reduce our revenues 
natural gas and oil prices are volatile  a sustained decrease in the price of natural gas or oil would adversely impact our business 
our success will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas 
these market prices tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions 
the general pace of global economic growth  the continued instability in the middle east and other oil and gas producing regions and actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  and its maintenance of production constraints  as well as other economic  political  and environmental factors will continue to affect world supply and prices 
domestic natural gas prices fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors including us economic conditions  weather patterns  other factors affecting demand such as substitute fuels  the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply  and the environmental and access issues that limit future drilling activities for the industry 
crude oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile 
average oil and natural gas prices decreased substantially during the year ended december  any additional actual or anticipated reduction in crude oil and natural gas prices may further depress the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
we expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the following table includes high and low natural gas prices price per mmbtu and crude oil prices wti during calendar year  as well as these prices at year end and at february  henry hub per mmbtu january  high september  low december  february  wti per barrel october  high february  low december  february  changes in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
prices for natural gas and crude oil declined sharply in the second half of and have remained low when compared with average prices in recent years 
these lower prices  coupled with the recent turmoil in financial markets that has significantly limited and increased the cost of capital  have compelled most natural gas and oil producers  including us  to reduce the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
this will have a significant effect on our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
any sustained reductions in natural gas and oil prices will directly affect our revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities 
further reductions in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable 
a reduction in our reserves could have other adverse consequences including a possible downward redetermination of the availability of borrowings under our senior credit facility  which would restrict our liquidity 
additionally  further or continued declines in prices could result in non cash charges to earnings due to impairment writedowns 
any such writedown could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 

table of contents 
index to financial statements a sustained depression of oil and natural gas prices can affect our ability to obtain funding  obtain funding on acceptable terms or obtain funding under our current credit facility 
this may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs 
we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed  and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available as needed  or is available only on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our development plan  enhance our existing business  complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
we hedged approximately of our total production volumes for the year ended december  our results of operations may be negatively impacted by our commodity derivative instruments and fixed price forward sales contracts in the future and these instruments may limit any benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
for the years ended december  and  we realized a gain on settled natural gas derivatives of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we realized a loss on settled commodity derivatives of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized loss was combined with a million realized gain resulting in a total gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million for for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized gain was combined with a million realized loss resulting in a total gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million for for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized loss was combined with a million realized gain resulting in a total loss on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million for we account for our natural gas derivatives using fair value accounting standards 
each derivative is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability at its fair value 
additionally  changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met at the time the derivative contract is executed 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting treatment to our swaps and collars and  as such  all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings 
our fixed price physical contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale exception 
contracts that qualify for this treatment do not require mark to market accounting treatment 
in the future  we will be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments 
see note derivative activities to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents 
index to financial statements because our operations require significant capital expenditures  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves  maintain production or maintain interests in our properties 
we must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have paid for these expenditures with cash from operating activities  proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales 
our revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons 
if our revenues or cash flows decrease  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels 
if this occurs  our production will decline over time 
other sources of financing may not be available to us if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure requirements 
where we are not the majority owner or operator of an oil and gas property  we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the particular property 
if we cannot fund such capital expenditures  our interests in some properties may be reduced or forfeited 
if we are unable to replace reserves  we may not be able to sustain production at present levels 
our future success depends largely upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development  exploration or acquisition activities  our proved reserves will decline over time 
in addition  approximately of our total estimated proved reserves by volume at december   were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves and timing of their production are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the lack of availability of sufficient capital to fund such future operations could materially hinder or delay our replacement of produced reserves 
we may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 
we may incur substantial impairment writedowns 
if management s estimates of the recoverable reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and natural gas prices decline  we may be required to record additional non cash impairment writedowns in the future  which would result in a negative impact to our financial position 
furthermore  any sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments 
we review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions 
for each property determined to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairments from continuing operations related to oil and gas properties of million  million and million  respectively 
management s assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as 
table of contents 
index to financial statements management s views related to future prices change  the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
a majority of our production  revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area 
essentially all of our estimated proved reserves at december   and all our production during was associated with our etnl properties which includes the haynesville shale 
accordingly  if the level of production from these properties substantially declines or is otherwise subject to a disruption in our operations resulting from operational problems  government intervention or natural disasters  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
for example  chesapeake and matador resources company operate certain properties in the haynesville shale 
encana corporation and st 
mary land and exploration company operate certain properties in the etnl area in which we have an interest 
we have less ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them versus those fields in which we are the operator 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our reduced influence or ability to control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs 
our ability to sell natural gas and receive market prices for our gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions 
we operate primarily in the etnl area  which is in the same geographic region as the recently discovered haynesville shale 
a number of companies are currently operating in the haynesville shale 
if drilling in the haynesville shale continues to be successful  the amount of natural gas being produced could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in this region 
if this occurs  it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built 
because of the current economic climate  certain pipeline projects that are planned for the etnl area may not occur or may be substantially delayed for lack of financing 
in addition  capital constraints could limit our ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our gas to interstate pipelines 
in such event  we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on nymex or that we currently project  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
a portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for numerous reasons  including as a result of weather conditions  accidents  loss of pipeline or gathering system access  field labor issues or strikes  or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time  it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our senior credit facility contains customary restrictions  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt  grant liens  make investments  consolidate  merge or acquire other businesses  sell assets  pay dividends and other distributions and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we also are required to meet 
table of contents 
index to financial statements specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the financial covenants of our senior credit facility 
these restrictions may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or to compete in our industry with companies not similarly restricted 
in addition  our current senior credit facility matures in august any replacement credit facility may have more restrictive covenants or provide us with less borrowing capacity 
we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them 
the acquisition of properties requires us to assess a number of factors  including recoverable reserves  development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain 
in connection with the assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well  platform or pipeline 
we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems  such as pipeline corrosion  when an inspection is made 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities relating to the acquired assets and indemnities are unlikely to cover liabilities relating to the time periods after closing 
we may be required to assume any risk relating to the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
the incurrence of an unexpected liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to stringent laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
development  production and sale of natural gas and oil in the us are subject to stringent and comprehensive laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  bonds for ownership  development and production of oil and gas properties  reports concerning operations  and taxation 
in addition  our operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection 
governmental authorities enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  which can result in an obligation to undertake difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws  regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our business 
the imposition of strict  and in certain circumstances  joint and several liabilities is common in environmental laws and may result in us incurring costs in connection with discharges or releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes due to our handling of those substances  the release of air emissions or water discharges in connection with our operations  and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices conducted by us or predecessor operators on  under or from our properties and from facilities where our wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal 
private parties affected by such discharges or releases may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as seek damages for personal injury or property damage 
in addition  changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce 
on december   the us environmental protection agency epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings allow the epa to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
accordingly  the epa has proposed regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and could trigger permit review for greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources 
in addition  on october   the epa published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in also  on june   the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of  or acesa  which would establish an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce us emissions of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane 
acesa would require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from levels by and just over an reduction of such emissions by under this legislation  the epa would issue a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances authorizing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
these reductions would be expected to cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time 
the net effect of acesa will be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil  refined petroleum products  and natural gas 
the us senate has begun work on its own legislation for restricting domestic greenhouse gas emissions and the obama administration has indicated its support for legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system 
at the state level  more than one third of the states  either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  and floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 
federal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely affect our support services 
congress is currently considering two companions bills for the fracturing responsibility and awareness of chemicals act  or frac act 
the bills would repeal an exemption in the federal safe drinking water act swda for the underground injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids near drinking water sources 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process for the completion of natural gas  and to a lesser extent  oil wells in shale formations  and involves the pressurized injection of water  sand and chemicals into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production 
sponsors of the frac act have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
if enacted  the frac act could result in additional regulatory burdens such as permitting  construction  financial assurance  monitoring  recordkeeping  and plugging and abandonment requirements 
the frac act also proposes requiring the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities  who would then make such information publicly available 
the availability of this information could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
in addition  various state and local governments are considering increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements  operational restrictions  and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain environmentally 
table of contents 
index to financial statements sensitive areas such as watersheds 
the adoption of the frac act or any other federal or state laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or otherwise limiting  the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations  increase our costs of compliance and doing business 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions 
we also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can 
our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
our success depends on our management team and other key personnel  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations 
our success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professional staff 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts  technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team 
if a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be adversely affected 
terrorist attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations 
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities particularly in the middle east may have on the energy industry in general  and on us in particular  is unknown 
uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  particularly oil  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war 
moreover  we have incurred additional costs since the terrorist attacks of september  to safeguard certain of our assets and we may be required to incur significant additional costs in the future 
the terrorist attacks on september   and the changes in the insurance markets attributable to such attacks have made certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to us without significant additional costs 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital 
the oil and gas business involves many uncertainties  economic risks and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
any of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
as a result  substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred 
the payment of these amounts could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions 
these reductions in funds could result in a loss of our properties 
additionally  some of our oil and gas operations are located in areas that are subject to weather disturbances such as 
table of contents 
index to financial statements hurricanes 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of such risks and losses 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities 
we maintain general and excess liability policies  which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards 
these policies generally cover personal injury  bodily injury  third party property damage  medical expenses  legal defense costs  pollution in some cases  well blowouts in some cases  and workers compensation 
as is common in the oil and natural gas industry  we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive 
a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover every claim made against us in the future 
a loss in connection with our oil and natural gas properties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations to the extent that the insurance coverage provided under our policies cover only a portion of any such loss 
the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
congress is currently considering legislation to impose restrictions on certain transactions involving derivatives  which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions 
acesa contains provisions that would prohibit private energy commodity derivative and hedging transactions 
acesa would expand the power of the commodity futures trading commission  or cftc  to regulate derivative transactions related to energy commodities  including oil and natural gas  and to mandate clearance of such derivative contracts through registered derivative clearing organizations 
under acesa  the cftc s expanded authority over energy derivatives would terminate upon the adoption of general legislation covering derivative regulatory reform 
the cftc is considering whether to set limits on trading and positions in commodities with finite supply  particularly energy commodities  such as crude oil  natural gas and other energy products 
the cftc also is evaluating whether position limits should be applied consistently across all markets and participants 
separately  the house of representatives adopted financial regulatory reform legislation on december   that among other things would impose comprehensive regulation on the over the counter otc derivatives marketplace 
this legislation would subject swap dealers and major swap participants to substantial supervision and regulation  including capital standards  margin requirements  business conduct standards  recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
it also would require central clearing for transactions entered into between swap dealers or major swap participants  and would provide the cftc with authority to impose position limits in the otc derivatives markets 
a major swap participant generally would be someone other than a dealer who maintains a substantial net position in outstanding swaps  excluding swaps used for commercial hedging or for reducing or mitigating 
table of contents 
index to financial statements commercial risk  or whose positions create substantial net counterparty exposure that could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the us banking system or financial markets 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when congress may act on derivatives legislation or how any climate change bill approved by the senate would be reconciled with acesa  any laws or regulations that may be adopted that subject us to additional capital or margin requirements relating to  or to additional restrictions on  our trading and commodity positions could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business or on the cost of our hedging activity 
certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
president obama s proposed fiscal year budget includes proposed legislation that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to us tax laws  including the elimination of certain key united states federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate or otherwise limit certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations with respect to oil and gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

some of these include  but are not limited to planned capital expenditures  future drilling activity  our financial condition  business strategy  the market prices of oil and gas  uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves  including uncertainties about the effects of the sec s new rules governing reserve reporting  economic and competitive conditions  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions and availability of capital  production  hedging arrangements  future cash flows and borrowings  litigation matters  more stringent environmental laws and increased difficulty in obtaining environmental permits  pursuit of potential future acquisition opportunities  and sources of funding for exploration and development 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although from time to time we make use of futures contracts  swaps  costless collars and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices or a prolonged continuation of low prices may substantially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents 
index to financial statements these factors  as well as additional factors that could affect our operating results and performance are described in this report under the headings business  risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we urge you to carefully consider those factors 
all forward looking statements attributable to us are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
we undertake no responsibility to update our forward looking statements 
overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  exploitation  development and production of oil and natural gas properties primarily in the etnl area  which includes the haynesville shale play 
we operate as one segment as each of our operating areas have similar economic characteristics and each meet the criteria for aggregation as defined by accounting standards related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we seek to increase shareholder value by growing our oil and gas reserves  production revenues and operating cash flow 
in our opinion  on a long term basis  growth in oil and gas reserves and production on a cost effective basis are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and gas company 
management strives to increase our oil and gas reserves  production and cash flow through exploration and exploitation activities 
we develop an annual capital expenditure budget which is reviewed and approved by our board of directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant 
we take into consideration our projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing  such as bank debt  when establishing our capital expenditure budget 
we place primary emphasis on our internally generated operating cash flow in managing our business 
for this purpose  operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities as reflected in our statement of cash flows 
management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of our financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income because operating cash flow considers only the cash expenses incurred during the period and excludes the non cash impact of unrealized hedging gains losses and impairments 
our revenues and operating cash flow are dependent on the successful development of our inventory of capital projects with available capital  the volume and timing of our production  as well as commodity prices for oil and gas 
such pricing factors are largely beyond our control however  we employ commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on our earnings and operating cash flow 
east texas and north louisiana area our relatively low risk development drilling program in the etnl area is primarily centered in and around rusk  panola  angelina and nacogdoches counties  texas and desoto and caddo parishes  louisiana 
we continue to build our acreage position in this area and hold  gross acres as of december  as of year end  we drilled and completed a cumulative total of wells in this area with a success rate in excess of 
our net production volumes from our etnl wells aggregated approximately  mcfe per day in  or approximately of our total oil and gas production for the year

for the last quarter of  net production from our operated haynesville shale wells horizontal and vertical totaled approximately  mcfe per day  or of the total company production 
we currently anticipate drilling approximately operated haynesville shale horizontal wells in chesapeake haynesville shale joint development through our joint development arrangement with chesapeake energy corporation chesapeake  which covers certain of our acreage in northwest louisiana  we continue to operate existing production and operate any new wells drilled to the base of the cotton valley sand  and chesapeake will operate any wells drilled below the base of the cotton valley sand  including the haynesville shale 
as of december   we participated in drilling operations on horizontal and vertical haynesville wells under the joint development arrangement 
as of year end  horizontal and vertical wells had reached initial production and the remaining horizontal wells were in some form of drilling or completion 
for  we and chesapeake plan to utilize three to four rigs to conduct drilling operations on approximately to gross additional haynesville shale horizontal wells

the decrease in the unit cost between the years is attributable to the absolute dollar cost reduction  a increase in production volumes and an increasing portion of our production coming from the haynesville shale  which carries lower production costs

the tgs tax credits allow for reduced and in many cases the complete elimination of severance taxes in the state of texas for qualifying wells for up to ten years of production 
we only accrue for such credits once we have been notified of the state s approval 
we anticipate that we will incur a gradually lower production tax rate in the future as we add additional texas qualifying wells to our production base and as reduced rates are approved

the number of properties we owned increased from january  to january  and the assessed values for our existing properties were higher year to year 
the combination of these two factors led to the increase in ad valorem taxes year to year 
transportation expense increased to million per mcfe in compared to million per mcfe in the increase in expense is primarily due to our higher production volumes while the lower unit costs are a function of our changing geographic production mix  as well as a greater percentage of sales coming from non operated properties from which the operator nets the transportation cost from revenues

the remaining million increase in dd a year to year is related to higher production in the dd a rate increased to per mcfe for from per mcfe for we calculated dd a rates for the first half of using the december  reserves 
we calculated the dd a rate for the second half of using an internally generated reserve report dated june   with a nymex gas price of per mmbtu 
while this internal reserve report was prepared in accordance with existing sec guidelines  it should not be construed as a fully independent engineering reserve report similar to what we have used in the past and what we used at year end 
the reserve estimates from this report as of june   resulted in a decrease in proved developed reserves from year end  due primarily to a reduction in the price used for purposes of evaluating the reserves  from per mmbtu at december  to per mmbtu at june  as a result  the dd a rate utilized for the second half of the year  increased to per mcfe versus per mcfe in the first half of the higher dd a rate of mainly results from a decrease in our proved developed reserves as of june  due to the impact of lower prices on our traditional cotton valley and travis peak vertical reserves  which represented a majority of our proved developed reserves at june  similarly  the higher rate for the second half of the year increased the dd a rate for the entire year to per mcfe  a increase from exploration expenses for increased million to million from million for exploration expenses include drilling contract early termination charges of million 
we recorded an impairment of million in on several of our fields as a result of the decrease in natural gas prices in from which lowered economical proved reserves 
proved and probable reserves were also lowered due to our strategic decision to decrease using vertical wellbores to develop our existing properties because this method is deemed no longer the most economic avenue to pursue 
as a result  the carrying value of our oil and gas assets exceeded their fair value as of december  by an additional million versus the last impairment test  which was run as of june  thus  the total impairment charge for the year was million  with the incremental million in charges taken at year end being spread across the following fields in north louisiana and east texas bethany longstreet million  bethune east gates million  loco bayou million  cotton south raintree million  and a collection of other fields million 
in all of these cases  the impairment charges were driven by the removal of the previously scheduled vertical proved and probable drilling locations and were partially offset by the addition of horizontal undeveloped locations in fields where such locations were deemed appropriate 
we recorded impairment expense of million in  related to the brachfield  blocker  alabama bend and gilmer fields  which are located in non core areas in north louisiana and east texas

summary of critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list in note description of business and accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the sec as those quantities of oil and gas which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether the estimate is a deterministic estimate or probabilistic estimate 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimates if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us 
we cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
in addition  the sec has not reviewed our or any reporting company s reserve estimates under the new rules and has released only limited interpretive guidance regarding reporting of reserve estimates under the new rules and may not issue further interpretive guidance on the new rules 
accordingly  while the estimates of our proved reserves at december  included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the new sec rules  those estimates could differ materially from any estimates we might prepare applying more specific sec interpretive guidance 

table of contents 
index to financial statements successful efforts accounting we use the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures and to calculate dd a 
unsuccessful exploration wells  as well as other exploration expenditures such as seismic costs  are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by engineers 
certain costs related to fields or areas that are not fully developed are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved oil and natural gas reserves 
fair value measurement fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we carry our derivative instruments at fair value and measure their fair value by applying the income approach  using level inputs based on third party quotes or available interest rate information and commodity pricing data obtained from third party pricing sources and our credit worthiness or that of our counterparties 
we carry our oil and gas properties held for use and for sale at fair value  using level inputs which are unobservable data such as discounted cash flow models or valuations  based on the company s various assumptions and future commodity prices 
we carry cash and cash equivalents  account receivables and payables at carrying value which represent fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments 
impairment of properties we monitor our long lived assets recorded in oil and gas properties in the consolidated balance sheets to ensure that they are not carried in excess of fair value 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
performing these evaluations requires a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable proved and probable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
we cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 
asset retirement obligations we are required to make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and gas properties in order to ensure that they are presented at fair value 
this requirement necessitates us to make estimates of our property abandonment costs that  in some cases  will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future 
such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements  technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict 
income taxes we are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us 
we periodically evaluate our tax operating loss and other carryforwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset  as well as a related valuation allowance  should be recognized in our financial statements 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position 
table of contents 
index to financial statements following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
see note description of business and accounting policies income taxes and note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation plans for all new  modified and unvested share based payment transactions with employees  we measure at fair value and recognize as compensation expense over the requisite period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model that requires us to develop estimates for assumptions used in the model 
the black scholes valuation model uses the following assumptions expected volatility  expected term of option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
expected volatility estimates are developed by us based on historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options
