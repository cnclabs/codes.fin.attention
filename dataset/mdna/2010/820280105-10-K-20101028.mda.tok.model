item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations backlog for information regarding our backlog concentrations as of august  we conduct our business development efforts principally with an in house sales force 
additionally  we engage independent contractors to market to certain clients and geographic areas 
we pay our sales force a base salary plus  when appropriate  an annual bonus that may consist of cash  stock options  restricted stock awards  stock  or any combination thereof 
we pay our independent contractors on a commission basis that also may include a monthly retainer 

table of contents a portion of our business  primarily our nuclear and fossil power plant maintenance business  is seasonal  resulting in fluctuations in revenues and gross profit in our plant services segment during our fiscal year 
generally  spring and autumn are the peak periods for our plant services segment 
competition the industries we serve are highly competitive and  for the most part  require substantial resources and highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
a large number of regional  national  and international engineering and construction companies are competing in these industries  and certain competitors may have greater financial and other resources and more experience  industry knowledge  and client relationships 
companies that we compete with in our power segment include bechtel corporation  fluor corporation  urs corporation  black veatch corporation  and zachry corporation 
companies that we compete with in our e c segment include cb i lummus  kbr  inc  samsung  the linde group  and technip 
companies that we compete with in our e i segment include chm hill  urs  fluor  jacobs engineering group  inc  bechtel  aecom  and tetratech  inc companies that we compete with in our plant services segment include fluor  day zimmerman  turner industries  kbr  and jacobs 
companies that we compete with in our f m segment consist of a number of smaller pipe fabricators in the us  while internationally our principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
companies that compete with our investment in westinghouse segment include areva  general electric ge  mitsubishi  hitachi  and atomstroyexport

backlog of unfilled orders our backlog represents management s estimate of potential future revenues we expect may result from contracts awarded to us by clients 
backlog is estimated using legally binding agreements for projects that management believes are likely to proceed 
management evaluates the potential backlog value of each project awarded based upon the nature of the underlying contract  commitment and other factors  including the economic  financial  and regulatory viability of the project and the likelihood of the contract proceeding 
projects in backlog may be altered increased or decreased for scope changes and or may be suspended or cancelled at any time by our clients 
the following table sets forth the consolidated backlog at august  and in millions

types of contracts our work is performed under two general types of contracts cost reimbursable contracts and fixed price contracts 
both types of contracts may be modified by cost escalation provisions or other risk sharing mechanisms  and both may include incentive and penalty provisions 
each of our contracts may contain components of more than one of the contract types discussed below 
for example  some of our contracts have elements of reimbursable with a maximum target price  fixed price subject to certain adjustments and fixed 
table of contents price and cost reimbursable provisions encompassed within one contract 
during the term of a project  the contract or components of the contract may be renegotiated to include characteristics of a different contract type 
we attempt to focus our epc activities on a cost reimbursable plus a fee or markup and negotiated fixed price work  each as described in more detail below 
we believe these types of contracts may help reduce our exposure to unanticipated and unrecoverable cost overruns 
when we negotiate any type of contract  we frequently are required to accomplish the scope of work and meet certain performance criteria within a specified timeframe  otherwise  we could be assessed damages that  in many cases  are pre agreed upon liquidated damages 
all contract types are subject to client authorized amendment 
at august   approximately of our backlog was comprised of cost reimbursable contracts and was comprised of fixed price contracts 
see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of the nature of our operations and types of contracts 
us government contracts typically are awarded through competitive bidding or negotiations pursuant to federal acquisition regulations and may involve several bidders or offerors 
government contracts also typically have annual funding limitations  are limited by public sector budgeting constraints and may be terminated at the discretion of the government agency with payment only for work performed and commitments made at the time of termination 
in the event of termination  we generally receive some allowance for profit on the work performed 
many of these contracts are multi year indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq agreements 
these programs provide estimates of a maximum amount the agency expects to spend 
our program management and technical staffs work closely with the government agency to define the scope and amount of work required 
although these contracts initially do not provide us with a specific amount of work  as projects are defined  the work may be awarded to us without further competitive bidding 
we generally include in our backlog an estimate of the work we expect to receive under these specific agreements 
although we generally serve as the prime contractor on our federal government contracts  or as part of a joint venture acting as the prime contractor  we also may serve as a subcontractor to other prime contractors 
with respect to bidding on large  complex environmental contracts  we have entered into  and expect to continue to enter into  joint venture or teaming arrangements with competitors 
us government contracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives  profit and cost controls  and limitations and provisions permitting modification or termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s discretion 
government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socio economic and other requirements 
failure to comply with such regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment  for cause  from future government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
some of the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes  including those related to employment practices  the protection of the environment  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
our continuing service agreements with clients expedite individual project contract negotiations through means other than the formal bidding process 
these agreements typically contain a standardized set of purchasing terms and pre negotiated pricing provisions and often provide for periodic price adjustments 
service agreements allow our clients to achieve greater cost efficiencies and reduced cycle times in the design and fabrication of complex piping systems for power generation  chemical and refinery projects 
additionally  while these agreements do not typically contain committed volumes  we believe that these agreements provide us with a steady source of new projects and help minimize the impact of short term pricing volatility and reduce our sales pursuit costs 
see part i  item a risk factors for additional discussion of the risks related to contractual arrangements  including our contracts with the us government 
raw materials and suppliers for our epc services  we often rely on third party equipment and raw materials manufacturers and subcontractors to complete our projects 
we are not substantially dependent on any individual third party to support these operations  however  we are subject to possible cost escalations based on inflation  currency and 
table of contents other industry price fluctuations resulting from supply and demand imbalances 
in the future  our mix of third party suppliers will increase as our construction phase progresses on our major nuclear epc contracts  and we may experience increased dependence on particular suppliers as a result 
we expect the current market for these inputs to continue to remain competitive throughout our fiscal year our principal raw materials for our pipe and steel fabrication operations are carbon steel  stainless and other alloy piping  which we obtain from a number of domestic and foreign steel producers 
the market for most raw materials is extremely competitive  and certain types of raw materials are available from only one or a few specialized suppliers 
in addition to manufacturing our own pipe fittings  we purchase some of our pipe fittings from other manufacturers 
these arrangements generally lower our pipe fabrication costs because we are often able to negotiate advantageous purchase prices as a result of the volume of our purchases 
if a manufacturer is unable to deliver the materials according to the negotiated terms  we may be required to purchase the materials from another source or manufacture our own pipe fittings at a higher price 
we keep certain items in stock at each of our facilities and transport items among our facilities as required 
we obtain materials that are more specialized from suppliers when required for a project 
in addition  see part i  item a risk factors for a discussion of our dependence on joint venture or consortium partners  subcontractors and equipment manufacturers 
environmental health safety ehs we actively promote a positive and proactive attitude toward safety in accordance with all applicable and related laws 
our mission is to be the industry leader in environmental  health and safety performance and is evidenced by our achievements in reaching safety milestones  winning safety awards and maintaining a low occupational safety and health administration osha case rate 
we reached full commercial operation of a grassroots ethylene plant for eastern petrochemical company sharq in saudi arabia without a lost time incident 
we strive for zero injuries  illnesses and environmental incidents on all of our job sites 
industry certifications in order to perform certain aspects of nuclear power plant construction  fabrication and installation activities of american society of mechanical engineers asme iii code items such as vessels  piping systems  supports and spent fuel canister storage containments at nuclear plant sites  our domestic subsidiary engineering and construction operations maintain the required asme certifications n  n  npt  and na stamps ns cert 
these asme certifications also authorize us to serve as a material organization for the supply of ferrous and nonferrous material 
we also maintain the national board nuclear repair certification nr stamp for n and n stamped nuclear components 
asme nqa is the nrc endorsed industry standard that defines the quality assurance program requirements for nuclear facility applications 
sms is a key contributor to the nuclear supply chain which commits to and complies with this standard 
in order to perform fabrication and repairs of coded piping systems  our domestic construction operations and fabrication facilities  as well as our subsidiaries in derby  uk  maracaibo  venezuela  and manama  bahrain  maintain the asme certification u and pp stamps 
the majority of our fabrication facilities  as well as our subsidiaries in derby  uk  maracaibo  venezuela  and manama  bahrain  also have obtained the required asme certification s stamp and the national board certification r stamp 
our domestic subsidiary engineering and construction operations also maintain the required asme certification s stamp and the national board repair certification r stamp  in addition to the asme certifications a  pp and u stamps and the national board registration certification nb stamp for s  a  pp and u stamped items 
our laurens  south carolina  facility also maintains a nuclear piping asme certification npt stamp and is authorized to fabricate piping for nuclear power plants and to serve as a material organization to manufacture and supply ferrous and nonferrous material 
this facility also is registered by the international organization of standards iso 
substantially all of our north american engineering operations  as well 
table of contents as our uk and middle east operations  are registered also by the international organization of standards iso 
this registration provides assurance to our clients that we have procedures to control quality in our fabrication processes 
patents  tradenames and licenses and other intellectual property we consider our computerized project control system  shawman tm  and our web based earned value application  shawtrac tm  to be proprietary assets 
our e c segment has developed or has the right to license leading process technologies  including technologies from third parties  used for the production of a variety of petrochemicals and chemicals 
we have a leading position in technology associated with the design and construction of plants that produce ethylene  which we protect and develop with license restrictions and a research and development program 
we believe our complete technology portfolio and experience in the commercial application of technologies and related know how differentiates us from our competitors  enhances our margins and provides early involvement in projects that may utilize our broad range of engineering  procurement and construction capabilities 
we also are developing and researching new technologies to complement and expand our offerings 
through our it group acquisition in and the acquisition of envirogen in  we acquired certain patents and proprietary technologies that are useful in our environmental remediation business 
the technologies include a number of processes for the treatment of soil and groundwater contaminated with a variety of compounds including organics  chlorinated organics  oxygenates and metals 
in addition  see part i  item a risk factors for the impact of changes in technology or new technology developments by our competitors could have on us 
environmental matters our us operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations at the federal  state and local level relating to environmental protection and the safety and health of personnel and the public 
these laws and regulations relate to a broad range of our activities  including those concerning emissions  discharges into waterways  and generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes 
environmental protection laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations  licenses  permits and other approvals 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in  among other things  administrative  civil and or criminal penalties  remedial requirements and orders limiting or enjoining some or all of our future operations 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and comparable state laws applicable to our domestic operations  we may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances and other regulated materials that have been released into the environment 
cercla and comparable state laws impose strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released  regardless of whether a company knew of or caused the release 
liable parties under cercla may be required to pay for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
our domestic operations generate solid wastes  including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the resources conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws 
failure by us to handle and dispose of solid and hazardous wastes in compliance with rcra may result in the imposition of liability  including remedial obligations 
we also could incur environmental liability at sites where we have been contractually hired by potentially responsible parties prps to remediate contamination of the site 
some prps have from time to time sought to expand the reach of cercla  rcra and similar state statutes to make the remediation contractor responsible for site cleanup costs in certain circumstances 
these prps have asserted that environmental contractors are owners or operators of hazardous waste facilities or that the contractors arranged for treatment  transportation or disposal of solid or hazardous wastes or hazardous substances 
if we are held 
table of contents responsible under cercla or rcra for damages caused while performing services or otherwise  we may be forced to incur cleanup costs and other costs directly  notwithstanding the potential availability of contribution or indemnification from other parties 
during the past several years  the epa and other federal agencies have significantly constricted the circumstances under which they will indemnify their contractors against liabilities incurred in connection with the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties 
the federal water pollution control act  also known as the clean water act  and applicable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the epa or applicable state agencies 
in addition  the oil pollution act of imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages  including natural resource damages  resulting from such spills in waters of the united states 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility 
the clean water act and analogous state laws provide for administrative  civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and  together with the oil pollution act  impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning  as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation  and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges 
the federal clean air act and analogous state laws require permits for facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality 
failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties 
more stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases ghgs may be adopted in the future and could impact our business 
on december   the epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane  and other ghgs present an endangerment to public heath and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climate changes 
these findings allow the epa to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
the epa has adopted regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and could trigger permit review for ghgs from certain stationary sources 
in june  epa adopted the prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule  which phases in permitting requirements for stationary sources of ghgs  beginning january  this rule tailors these permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
in addition  in april  the epa proposed to expand its existing ghg reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production  processing  transmission  storage  and distribution facilities 
in addition  both houses of congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs  and more than one third of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances  with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved 
it is not possible to predict at this time whether these requirements or any regulations or legislation adopted in the future to control ghg emissions would have an overall negative or positive impact on our business 
if these requirements increase the cost of doing business for our customers and reduce the demand for our customers products  the demand for our services could be reduced 
alternatively  these requirements could result in an increased demand for our services related to the reduction of emissions 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms including hurricanes  droughts  and floods  and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 
our operations outside of the us are subject to similar foreign governmental controls and restrictions pertaining to protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public 
for example  with respect to climate change  many foreign nations but not the us have agreed to limit emissions for ghg pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto 
table of contents protocol 
failure to comply with foreign requirements  including the kyoto protocol  in areas outside of the us where we conduct operations may lead to government sanctions resulting in penalties  remedial obligations and injunctive relief against future activities 
the environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject are changing constantly  and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on us in the future 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
to date  our costs net of any insurance proceeds with respect to environmental compliance have not been material  and to our knowledge  we have not incurred any material net environmental liability 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will not incur material environmental costs or liabilities in the future

risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our stock price  business  financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this form k the risk factors described below are not the only ones we face 
our stock price  business  financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by additional factors that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us  such as general economic conditions 
the categorization of risks set forth below is meant to help you better understand the risks facing our business and is not intended to limit consideration of the possible effects of these risks to the listed categories 
any adverse effects related to the risks discussed below may  and likely will  adversely affect many aspects of our business 
you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page in this form k 
all forward looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below 
risks related to our operations demand for our products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to sudden economic downturns and reductions in private industry and government spending and or their ability to meet existing payment obligations 
if general economic conditions continue to weaken or the credit markets deteriorate  then we may be unable to recover expenditures and our revenues  profits and our financial condition may be negatively impacted 
the industries we serve historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the domestic and international economies 
consequently  our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate depending on the demand for products and services from these industries 
fluctuations in the economy can affect consumer s demand for electricity and thus our clients capital spending priorities 
due to the current economic downturn  many of our clients may face budget shortfalls or may delay capital spending resulting in a decrease in the overall demand for our services 
a decrease in state tax revenue as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending 
our clients may find it more difficult to raise capital in the future due to limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the municipal and global credit markets 
this reduction in spending could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our clients may demand better pricing terms and their ability to timely pay our invoices may be affected by an ongoing weak economy 
our business traditionally lags any recovery in the economy  therefore  our business may not recover immediately upon any economic improvement 
if the economy weakens further or government spending is reduced  then our revenues  net income and overall financial condition may deteriorate 
further  in many instances during the course of a project  we commit and or pay for products or expenses attributable to our clients with an understanding that the client will pay us per the terms of our commercial contract with them 
our clients may not be able to make such payments to us in a timely manner  or at all  in which case we could be forced to absorb these costs requiring that we commit our financial resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the client 
if a client defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant financial resources  it could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we face substantial competition in each of our business segments 
we face competition from numerous regional  national and international competitors  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
our competitors include well established  well financed businesses  both privately and publicly held  including many major energy equipment manufacturers and engineering and construction companies  some engineering companies  internal engineering departments at 
table of contents utilities and some of our clients 
the award of many of our contracts is determined by competitive bid 
that competition can impact the margin we earn on our contracts or cause us not to win the award 
for a discussion of certain specific competitors as well as the impact of competition on our business  please see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
our results of operations depend on new contract awards  however  the selection process and timing for performing these contracts are not within our control 
a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly dependent on winning new contracts 
we operate in highly competitive markets and it is difficult to predict whether and when we will be awarded new contracts due to a multiple of factors including the lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  client capital investment decisions  market conditions  available financing  government approvals  permitting and environmental matters 
further  most of those same factors can delay or stop a project 
consequently  we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors and the risk a project may experience significant delay or cancellation impacting our results of operations and cash flows which fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing and size of new contract awards 
our backlog of unfilled orders is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  not a reliable indicator of our future revenues or earnings 
at august   our backlog was approximately billion 
our backlog consists of projects for which we have legally binding contracts or commitments from clients  including legally binding agreements without defined scope 
commitments may be in the form of written contracts for specific projects  purchase orders or indications of the amounts of time and materials we need to make available for clients anticipated projects 
our backlog includes expected revenue based on engineering and design specifications that may not be final and could be revised over time and for government and maintenance contracts that may not specify actual dollar amounts for the work to be performed 
for these contracts  we calculate our backlog of estimated work to be performed  based on our knowledge of our clients stated intentions or our historic experience 
projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time 
there can be no assurance we will realize revenues projected in our backlog or  if realized  such revenues will result in profits 
due to project terminations  suspensions and or changes in project scope and schedule  we cannot predict with certainty when or if our backlog will be performed 
for example  one new build coal petroleum coke fired generation facility was canceled and removed from backlog in the second quarter of fiscal we can provide no assurance that we will not receive additional cancellations 
even where a project proceeds as scheduled  it is possible that the client may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us 
material delays  cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our balance sheet  results of operations and cash flow and may reduce the value of our stock 
for example  during the fiscal quarter ended may   we received notice from our client of a significant delay in the construction schedule for two new ap nuclear reactors to be located in florida 
our client advised us that activities for the project would be slowed considerably until the combined operating license col is issued by the nrc for the plant which we understand  if the license schedule remains on schedule  will occur in late as a result  the proposed first reactor is now expected to enter service in  with the second anticipated months later 
in the interim  we continue to perform limited engineering and support services  however  the amount of revenues and contract profit expected to be generated from this project during fiscal year and is likely to be immaterial when considered in relation to our consolidated operations 
client cancellations could reduce our backlog  which  among other things  could materially impact the revenues and earnings 
many of the contracts in our backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event clients cancel projects 
these cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out of pocket costs  revenues for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed 
however  upon cancellation we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog for that particular contract 

table of contents the nature of our contracts  particularly our reimbursable and fixed price contracts  could adversely affect us 
approximately of our backlog at august   was from cost reimbursable contracts and the remaining was from contracts that are primarily fixed price 
revenues and gross profit from both cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts can be significantly affected by contract incentives penalties that may not be known or finalized until the later stages of the contract term 
under certain reimbursable contracts containing a target price  we agree to the contract price of the project at the time we enter into the contract 
while we benefit from costs savings and earnings from approved change orders under target priced contracts  we are generally unable to recover all cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under certain reimbursable target price contracts  we share with the client any savings up to a negotiated or target ceiling 
when costs exceed the negotiated ceiling price  we may be required to reduce our fee or to absorb some or all of the cost overruns 
we also assume the risks related to revenue  cost and gross profit realized on fixed priced contracts that can vary  sometimes substantially  from the original projections due to changes in a variety of other factors that include  but are not limited to engineering design changes  unanticipated technical problems with the equipment being supplied or developed by us  which may require that we spend our own money to remedy the problem  changes in the cost of equipment  commodities  materials or labor  difficulties in obtaining required permits or approvals  changes in laws and regulations  changes in labor conditions  including the availability and productivity of labor  project modifications creating unanticipated costs  delays caused by local weather conditions  failure to perform by our project owners  suppliers or subcontractors  and general economic conditions 
these risks may be exacerbated by the length of time between signing a contract and completing the project because most fixed price contracts are long term 
the term of our contracts can be as long as approximately seven years 
long term  fixed price contracts often make us subject to penalties if portions of the project are not completed in accordance with agreed upon time limits 
therefore  significant losses can result from performing large  long term projects on a fixed price basis 
these losses may be material  including  in some cases  up to or exceeding the full contract value in certain events of non performance  and could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we enter into contractual agreements with clients for some of our epc services to be performed based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
some of these contracts provide for the client s review of our accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the client 
many of our client contracts require us to satisfy specified design or epc milestones in order to receive payment for the work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable milestone 
as a result  under these types of arrangements  we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment 
if the client determines not to proceed with the completion of the project or if the client defaults on its payment obligations  we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies 
in addition  many of our clients for large epc projects are project specific entities that 
table of contents do not have significant assets other than their interests in the epc project 
it may be difficult for us to collect amounts owed to us by these clients 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us for these matters  we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project  which could result in a material loss 
our failure to meet contractual schedule or performance requirements could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
in certain circumstances  we guarantee project completion by a scheduled date or certain performance testing levels 
failure to meet these schedule or performance requirements could result in a reduction of revenues and or additional costs  and these adjustments could exceed projected profits 
a project s revenues could also be reduced by liquidated damages withheld by clients under contractual penalty provisions  which can be substantial and can accrue on a daily basis 
our costs generally increase from schedule delays and or could exceed our projections for a particular project 
performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and our client base 
for examples of the kinds of claims that may result from liquidated damages provisions and cost overruns  see note accounting for claims  unapproved change orders and incentives on long term construction contracts included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f if our joint venture or consortium partners  subcontractors or equipment manufacturers fail to perform their contractual obligations on a project  we could be exposed to the risk of loss  and in some cases  joint and several liability to our clients  loss of reputation and additional financial performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses 
we often enter into consortium arrangements and joint ventures as part of our power segment  e c segment and e i segment contracts in order to jointly bid and perform a particular project 
the success of these consortium agreements and joint ventures depends  in large part  on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations by our partners 
if our partners do not meet their obligations  the consortium or joint venture may be unable to adequately perform and deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to incur additional costs  make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services and or to pay liquidated damages 
under agreements with joint and several liability  we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners 
these additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture  which could also negatively affect our reputation in the industries we serve 
additionally  we rely on third party partners  equipment manufacturers and third party subcontractors to complete our projects 
to the extent our partners cannot execute their portion of the work  are unable to deliver their services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms and or we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services in an effort to meet our contractual obligations exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed price work  we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
if we are unable to form teaming arrangements  particularly for some of our international opportunities  our ability to compete for and win business may be negatively impacted 
in both the private and public sectors  either acting as a prime contractor  a subcontractor or as a member of consortium  we may join with other firms to form a team to compete for a single contract 
because a team can often offer stronger combined qualifications than any firm standing alone  these teaming arrangements can be very important to the success of a particular contract bid process or proposal 
this can be particularly true in international operations in which bidding success can be substantially impacted by the presence and or quality of the local partner 
the failure to maintain such relationships in both foreign and domestic markets may impact our ability to win work

we are a major provider of services to us government agencies and therefore are exposed to risks associated with government contracting 
government clients typically can terminate or modify contracts with us at their convenience 
as a result  our backlog may be reduced or we may incur a loss if a government agency decides to terminate or modify a contract with us 
we are also subject to audits  cost reviews and investigations by government contracting oversight agencies 
during the course of an audit  the oversight agency may disallow costs 
cost disallowances may result in adjustments to previously reported revenues and may require refunding previously collected cash proceeds 
in addition  our failure to comply with the terms of one or more of our government contracts or government regulations and statutes could result in our being suspended or barred from future government projects for a significant period of time  possible civil or criminal fines and penalties and the risk of public scrutiny of our performance  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other remedies that our government clients may seek for improper activities or performance issues include sanctions such as forfeiture of profits and suspension of payments 
our government contracts present us with other risks as well 
legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year by year basis  while contract performance may take more than one year 
as a result  our contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated  and we may not realize all of our potential revenues and profits from those contracts 
appropriations and the timing of payment may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  curtailments in the use of government contracting firms  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures 
for the fiscal year ended august   of our e i segment s backlog was with us government agencies 
the limitation or the modification of the price anderson act s indemnification authority and similar federal programs for nuclear and other potentially hazardous activities  could adversely affect our business 
the price anderson act paa comprehensively regulates the manufacture  use and storage of radioactive materials  while promoting the nuclear energy industry by offering indemnification to the nuclear industry against liability arising from nuclear incidents in the us for non military facilities for incidents in connection with contractual activity for doe  while still ensuring compensation for the general public 
the energy policy act of extended the period of coverage to include all nuclear power reactors issued construction permits through december  because we provide services to the doe at nuclear weapons facilities and the nuclear energy industry in the ongoing maintenance and modification  as well as decontamination and decommissioning  of its nuclear energy plants  we are entitled to the indemnification protections under the paa 
although the paa s indemnification provisions are broad  it does not apply to all liabilities that we might incur while performing services as a radioactive materials cleanup contractor for doe and the nuclear energy industry 
public law pl which indemnifies government contractors who conduct certain approved contractual activity related to unusually hazardous or nuclear activity  may provide additional or alternative indemnification for such activities 
if the contractor protection currently provided by the paa or pl is significantly modified  is not approved for  or does not extend to all of our services  our business could be adversely affected by either our clients refusal to retain us for potentially covered projects or our inability to obtain commercially adequate insurance and indemnification 
if the us were to change its support of nuclear power or revoke or limit doe s loan guarantee program lgp  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the us government has been supportive of increased investment in nuclear power 
however  if the us government changed its policy or public acceptance of nuclear technology as a means of generating electricity significantly wanes  demand for nuclear power could be negatively affected and potentially increase 
table of contents the regulation of the nuclear power industry 
because several of our segments deal with nuclear power either directly or indirectly  this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
some of our clients may rely on doe s lgp  under which doe issues loan guarantees to eligible projects that avoid  reduce  or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to technologies in service in the us at the time the guarantee is issued 
if the current administration were to revoke or limit doe s lgp  it could make obtaining funding more difficult for many of our clients which could inhibit their ability to take on new projects resulting in a negative impact on our future operations 
we may be exposed to additional risks in our power segment  as we begin to execute our significant nuclear backlog and book new nuclear awards 
these risks include greater backlog concentration in fewer projects  possibly increasing requirements for letters of credit and potential cost overruns which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and liquidity 
additionally  the current economic conditions may impact the pace of the development of nuclear projects 
we expect to convert a significant part of our backlog of nuclear projects in the power segment into revenues in the future 
nuclear projects may utilize larger sums of working capital than other projects in this segment and will be concentrated among a few larger clients 
as we increase our active projects in the nuclear business  and consequently our reliance in revenues from this business  we may become more dependent on a smaller number of clients 
if we lose clients in our nuclear business and are unable to replace them  our revenues could be materially adversely impacted 
additionally  if any of the nuclear projects currently included in our backlog are significantly delayed  modified or canceled  our reported backlog and future earnings may be materially and adversely impacted 
as we convert our nuclear projects from backlog into active construction we may face significantly greater requirements for the provision of letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancements 
together with the initial fixed construction costs for nuclear plants  which are significantly higher than those for coal or gas fired plants  we may be required to significantly expand our access to capital and credit 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access such capital and credit as needed or that we would be able to do so on economically attractive terms 
finally  the significant expense associated with nuclear projects  weak global economic conditions and other competitive factors  including less expensive alternative energies like natural gas  may result in additional delays for currently expected projects or slower demand for nuclear energy projects over time 
environmental laws and regulations expose us to certain risks  could increase our costs and liabilities and impact demand for our services 
while all of our operations are impacted by environmental laws and regulations  these impacts may be most significant for our nuclear and integrated environmental solutions businesses 
general our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning emissions into the air  climate change legislation  discharges into waterways  generation  storage  handling  treatment  transport and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances  and health and safety 
our projects often involve highly regulated materials  including hazardous and nuclear materials and wastes 
environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards relating to the use  handling  transport  discharge or disposal of regulated materials and require us to obtain a permit and comply 
table of contents with various other requirements 
the improper characterization  use  handling  discharge or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations or associated environmental permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to perform some or all of our activities under existing contracts 
the risks associated with these activities are most significant within our e i segment  which has two subsidiaries the land bank group inc and shaw environmental solutions llc that purchase and or assume liability with respect to properties that have experienced environmental damage 
we can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage or other loss remediation strategies will insulate us from any material liability associated with these operations 
in addition to existing environmental regulations  the adoption and implementation of regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  our customers equipment and operations could significantly impact demand for our services  particularly among our customers for coal and gas fired generation facilities as well as our customers in the petrochemicals business 
any significant reduction in demand for our services as a result of the adoption of these or similar proposals could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 
nuclear operations nuclear projects  due to their size and complexity  may be subject to significant cost overruns which could adversely affect us 
the complexity of these projects is increased by permit  licensing and regulatory approvals that can be even more stringent and time consuming than similar processes for more conventional construction projects 
we are subject to regulations from a number of entities  including the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  international atomic energy agency iaea and the european union eu  which have a substantial effect on our nuclear operations 
an example of the way these regulatory entities impact our business is the nrc s certification process for the ap design 
the nrc notified westinghouse that the proposed ap shield building design will require modification before it will certify the ap design 
the iaea and the eu both have systems for nuclear material safeguards 
global scale agreements on nuclear safety such as the convention on nuclear safety and the joint convention on the safety of spent fuel management and on the safety of radioactive waste management are also in place 
the euratom treaty has created uniform safety standards aimed at protecting the public and workers and passed rules governing the transportation of radioactive waste 
in addition  licensed nuclear facilities must comply with strict inspection procedures 
regulations governing the shutdown and dismantling of nuclear facilities and the disposal of nuclear wastes could also have an effect on our operations 
delays in receiving necessary approvals  permits or licenses  failure to maintain sufficient compliance programs  or other problems encountered during construction could cause our actual results of operations to significantly differ from anticipated results  our  our clients and our partners ability to receive the applicable regulatory and environmental approvals for our projects and the timeliness of those approvals could adversely affect us 
the regulatory permitting process for many of the projects performed by our power segment requires significant investments of time and money by our clients and sometimes by our partners 
there are no assurances that we or our clients will obtain the necessary permits for these projects 
applications for permits to operate these fossil and nuclear fueled facilities  including air emissions permits  may be opposed by individuals or environmental groups  resulting in delays and possible non issuance of the permits 
for example  the delayed ap design certification due to the proposed ap shield building described above may cause a schedule modification 
while we believe westinghouse will be able to satisfy the nrc s concerns and receive design certification  this or similar certification actions could affect or delay our ability to complete our projects 
additionally  we have been advised that activities for an ap nuclear reactor to be built in florida will be slowed considerably until a combined operating license col is issued by the nrc for the plant 
we understand that the issuance of the col may be delayed until as a result  the first reactor in florida is now expected to enter service in the timeframe  with the second anticipated months later 

table of contents due to the international nature of our business we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act  similar worldwide anti bribery laws  and various international trade and export laws 
the international nature of our business creates various domestic and local regulatory challenges 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit us based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
we operate in many parts of the world that experience government corruption to some degree  and  in certain circumstances  compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with those local customs and practices 
our fcpa policy and training provide our employees with procedures  guidelines and information about fcpa obligations and compliance 
further  we advise our partners  subcontractors  agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they are obligated to comply with the fcpa 
we have procedures and controls in place designed to ensure internal and external compliance 
additionally  our global operations require us to import and export goods and technologies across international borders  which requires a robust compliance program 
however  such internal controls and procedures will not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other regulatory violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
political and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 
approximately of our fiscal year revenues were attributable to projects in international markets  some of which are subject to political unrest and uncertainty 
in addition to the specific challenges we face internationally  international contracts  operations and expansion expose us to risks inherent in doing business outside the us  including uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we make capital investments  operate and sell products and services  the lack of well developed legal systems and less established or traditional business practices in some countries in which we operate and sell products and services  which could make it difficult for us to enforce our contractual rights  security and safety of employees and subcontractors  expropriation of property  restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  changes in labor conditions  changing general economic and political conditions in foreign markets  terrorist attacks  commodity prices and availability  potential incompatibility with foreign joint venture partners  and interruptions or delays in international shipping 
foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects 
we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in usd or in the currencies of our expenditures 
however  we do enter into contracts that subject us to foreign exchange risks  particularly to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
we attempt to minimize our exposure from foreign exchange risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies  
table of contents or entering into hedge contracts when there are different currencies for contract revenues and costs 
however  these actions may not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks 
our westinghouse bonds are jpy denominated 
as the usd jpy exchange rate changes  the amount of usd required to service this debt will change 
the recent adoption of financial reform legislation by the united states congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with our business 
the united states congress recently adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities  including businesses like ours  that participate in that market 
the new legislation  known as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  was signed into law by the president on july   and requires the commodities futures trading commission and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within days from the date of enactment 
the dodd frank act may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities  although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time 
the dodd frank act may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty 
the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
any of these consequences could have a material  adverse effect on our business  our financial condition  and our results of operations 
risks related to our investment in westinghouse could have an adverse effect on us 
we incur significant interest cost on the westinghouse bonds issued to finance our investment in westinghouse  and we can provide no assurance that we will receive dividends from westinghouse sufficient to cover these costs 
in an effort to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time  to hedge the impact of exchange rate changes on our jpy denominated cash interest payments on the westinghouse bonds 
we normally focus our hedge transactions to the jpy interest payments due within the following twelve months 
we may be forced by the westinghouse bond holders to put all or part of our westinghouse equity back to toshiba 
in connection with our investment in westinghouse and issuing the westinghouse bonds  we entered into the put option with toshiba providing us the option to sell all or part of our westinghouse equity to toshiba during a defined exercise period 
we are currently within the exercise period that commenced upon the earlier of march   or a toshiba event 
toshiba timely notified us that it experienced a toshiba event as of may   when it failed to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth of jpy billion 
although in june toshiba reported that it raised sufficient equity to bring its consolidated net worth above the toshiba event threshold  the toshiba event itself triggered certain rights for the westinghouse bond holders under the terms of the bond trust deed 
the toshiba event is not an event of default or other violation of the bond trust deed or the put option agreements  but due to the toshiba event  the westinghouse bond holders now have an opportunity to direct us to exercise the put option  through which we would receive the pre determined jpy denominated put price and use those proceeds to pay off the jpy denominated westinghouse bond debt 
to do so  a supermajority of the bondholders representing a majority of not less than an aggregate of the principal amount outstanding must pass a resolution instructing the bond trustee to direct us to exercise the put option 
specifically  in order for the bond trustee to direct us to exercise the put option  the westinghouse bond 
table of contents holders must convene a meeting with a quorum of bondholders representing no less than of the westinghouse bonds principal amount outstanding during which a majority of the required quorum approves a resolution instructing the bond trustee to direct the exercise 
alternatively  a written resolution signed by bondholders representing no less than of the westinghouse bond principal amount outstanding and instructing the bond trustee to direct us to exercise the put option shall have the same effect collectively  an extraordinary resolution 
to our knowledge  the westinghouse bond holders have not taken any action toward an extraordinary resolution 
the bondholders decision is beyond our control  and we can provide no assurances that the holders will not issue an extraordinary resolution in the future 
in the event we exercise the put option at the direction of an extraordinary resolution or following a toshiba event  toshiba is required to pay us approximately jpy billion equal to of the face value of the westinghouse bonds currently outstanding 
however  if we exercise the put option under other provisions of the put option  we may be required to fund the estimated difference equal to jpy billion  or the usd equivalent of approximately million using exchange rates at august  between the anticipated put option proceeds and the principal amount owed on the westinghouse bonds 
because the put option agreement require toshiba to repurchase the westinghouse equity from us and any proceeds received from toshiba s repurchase of the westinghouse equity must be used to repay the westinghouse bonds  the bond holders decision to issue an extraordinary resolution may be significantly influenced by toshiba s financial condition as well as conditions in the general credit markets 
if the westinghouse bond holders issue an extraordinary resolution  we may consider a variety of alternatives  including seeking a consent solicitation to modify or waive certain terms of the bond trust deed and related transaction documents  refinancing some or all of our investment in westinghouse or negotiating the purchase of all or part of the equity subject to the put option 
if we decide to repay or refinance the westinghouse bonds  we may use some of our existing cash and or seek to raise capital from the debt and or equity markets 
there can be no assurance that should we wish to repay or refinance the westinghouse bonds  we will be able to access sufficient capital on terms acceptable to us  and ultimately  we may be forced to put all of the westinghouse equity to toshiba 
sale of more than of our westinghouse equity may affect our ability to extend the westinghouse cra beyond its original term  which expires in however  neither our nor toshiba s obligations under the westinghouse cra will be affected should we exercise the put option at the direction of an extraordinary resolution through its original term  which expires in although we have significant influence as a member on the board of the westinghouse companies  we do not have any rights to control the outcome of material decisions and activities related to the westinghouse business 
we have limited access to  and ability to disclose  the details of the westinghouse business and its operations 
further  we are subject to limitations on our ability to sell our westinghouse equity without the approval of the other shareholders 
although we have obtained certain rights to bid on westinghouse ap nuclear plant projects and preferred rights to provide other services  we can provide no assurance that we will obtain significant future business from this arrangement 
for additional information  see investment in westinghouse segment in our business segments above  note equity method investments and note debt and revolving lines of credit included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f and in liquidity below 
the nature of our projects exposes us to potential professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims  which may reduce our profits 
we engineer  construct and perform services in large industrial facilities where accidents or system failures can have significant consequences 
any such accident or failure at a site where we provided epc or similar services could result in significant professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims against us  regardless of whether our products or services caused the incident 
further  the engineering and construction projects we perform expose us to additional risks including  but not limited to  equipment failures  
table of contents personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  permitting delays  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems  each of which could significantly impact our performance and materially impact our financial statements 
additionally  once our construction is complete  we may face claims relating to our job performance  which could materially impact our financial statements 
under some of our contracts  we must use client specified metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for our clients 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against us for significant replacement or reworking costs  which could materially impact our financial statements 
we have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters 
should we be determined liable  we may not be covered by insurance or  if covered  the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
our professional liability coverage is on a claims made basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect 
even where insurance is maintained for such exposures  the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims 
any damages not covered by our insurance  in excess of our insurance limits or  if covered by insurance subject to a high deductible  could result in a significant loss for us  which may reduce our profits and cash available for operations 
risks related to financial reporting and corporate governance actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements 
to prepare financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  our management is required to make estimates and assumptions  as of the date of the financial statements  that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by our management include  among other things contract costs and profits and application of the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues recognized  and reduction of costs recognized  as a result of contract claims and unapproved change orders  revenues recognized related to project incentives we expect to earn  recoverability of inventory and application of lower of cost or market accounting  provisions for uncollectible receivables and client claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors  vendors and others  provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances  recoverability of goodwill  recoverability of other intangibles and related estimated lives  valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations  valuation of defined benefit pension plans  and accruals for estimated assets and liabilities  including litigation and insurance recoveries reserves 
under our accounting policies  we measure and recognize a large portion of our profits and revenue under the percentage of completion accounting methodology 
this methodology allows us to recognize revenue and profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the cost incurred to date against the total amount of cost estimated to be incurred 
our actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
changes in reported amounts  the effects of those changes and changes in estimates may be recorded in future periods 

table of contents if we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill and or our intangible assets  our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 
we had million of goodwill and million of intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at august  goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet  it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired 
we also perform an annual review of our goodwill and intangible assets to determine if it has become impaired which would require us to write down the impaired portion of these assets 
if we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and or intangible assets  our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our operating results could be harmed 
we devote significant attention to establishing and maintaining effective internal controls 
implementing changes to our internal controls has required compliance training of our directors  officers and employees and has entailed substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems 
although these measures are designed to do so  we cannot be certain that such measures and future measures will guarantee that we will successfully implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting processes and related reporting requirements 
for example  in the past we have discovered a material weakness relating to project reporting on epc fixed price contracts and in income tax accounting  each of which we have taken steps to remediate 
however  any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could affect our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and could result in a breach of a covenant in our facility in future periods 
ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the market price of our stock 
we rely on our information systems to conduct our business  and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
additionally  if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time  our business could be harmed 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems 
information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists 
we rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems 
however  these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches 
in addition  the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs  causing our business and results of operations to suffer 
any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have in place a shareholder rights plan  and provisions in our articles of incorporation by laws that may discourage a change of control of our company 
certain of our corporate governing documents contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  certain provisions in our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to determine the powers  preferences and rights of preference shares and to issue preference shares without shareholder approval 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the third party s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders 
additionally  we have a shareholder rights plan that  among other things  allows our 
table of contents shareholders to purchase preferred stock at a reduced price if certain parties attempt to acquire a substantial interest in us without the approval of our board of directors 
any one of the provisions discussed above could discourage third parties from obtaining control of us 
these provisions may also impede a transaction in which our shareholders could receive a premium over then current market price and our shareholders ability to approve transactions that they consider in their best interests 
risks related to our liquidity and capital resources non compliance with covenants in our credit facility  without waiver or amendment from the lenders  could require us to post cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and could adversely affect our ability to borrow under the facility 
our credit facility facility contains certain financial covenants  including a leverage ratio  a minimum debt service coverage ratio and a defined minimum consolidated net worth 
in addition  we are required to file our quarterly and annual reports with the sec on a timely basis 
the defined terms used in calculating the financial covenants require us to follow gaap  which requires the use of judgments and estimates 
we may not be able to satisfy these ratios  especially if our operating results deteriorate as a result of  but not limited to  the impact of other risk factors that may have a negative impact on our future earnings 
additionally  we may not be able to file our sec reports on a timely basis 
a breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our facility  and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments from our lenders to remedy a default 
in the event of any default not waived  the lenders under our facility are not required to lend any additional amounts or issue letters of credit and could elect to require us to apply all of our available cash to collateralize any outstanding letters of credit  declare any outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable or require us to apply all of our available cash to repay any borrowings then outstanding at the time of default 
if we are unable to collateralize our letters of credit or repay borrowings with respect to our facility when due  our lenders could proceed against their collateral  which consists of substantially all of our assets 
if any future indebtedness under our facility is accelerated  we can provide no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
at august   we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility with outstanding letters of credit inclusive of both domestic financial and domestic performance of approximately million 
our borrowing capacity under the facility is reduced by the aggregate amount of letters of credit we have outstanding 
further  we have entered into indemnity agreements with our sureties that contain cross default provisions 
accordingly  in the event of a default under our facility  we would need to obtain a waiver from our sureties or an amendment to our indemnity agreements 
we can provide no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining an amendment or waiver 
downgrades by rating agencies  inability to obtain adequate surety bonding or letters of credit could affect our business strategies by requiring us to modify existing bonding facilities and or reduce our ability to bid on new work which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects 
in certain circumstances  clients may require us to provide credit enhancements  including bonds or letters of credit 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to clients 
these bonds and letters of credit provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a bond or letter of credit on terms commercially acceptable to us  we cannot pursue that project 
we have letter of credit and bonding facilities but  as is typically the case  the issuance of bonds under our surety facilities is at the surety s sole discretion 

table of contents in the event our debt ratings are lowered by independent rating agencies such as moody s investors service or standard poor s s p  it could be more difficult for us to obtain surety bonding for new projects in the future  and we may be required to increase or provide additional cash collateral to obtain these surety bonds  which would reduce our available cash and could impact our ability to renew or increase availability under our facility 
any new or modified bonding facilities might not be on terms as favorable as those we have currently  and we could also be subject to increased costs of capital and interest rates 
we continue to expand our business in areas where the underlying contract must be bonded  especially in government services in which bonding is predominately provided by insurance sureties 
these surety bonds indemnify the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
failure to provide a bond on terms required by a client may result in an inability to compete for or win a project 
historically  we have had a strong surety bonding capacity but  as is typically the case  bonding is at the surety s sole discretion 
in addition  because of a reduction in overall worldwide bonding capacity  we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide the contract required bonding 
moreover  these contracts are often very large and extremely complex  which often necessitates the use of a joint venture  often with a competitor  to bid on and perform these types of contracts  especially since it may be easier to jointly pursue the necessary bonding 
however  entering into these types of joint ventures or partnerships exposes us to the credit and performance risks of third parties  many of whom are not as financially strong as us 
restrictive covenants in our facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our facility limits our ability to  among other things incur indebtedness or contingent obligations  issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make distributions to our shareholders  repurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  create liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us  make capital expenditures  enter into transactions with our shareholders and affiliates  sell and pledge assets  and acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
these covenants may also impair our ability to engage in favorable business activities and our ability to finance future operations or capital needs in furtherance of our business strategies 
moreover  the form or level of our indebtedness may prevent us from raising additional capital on attractive terms or obtaining additional financing if needed 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our facility 
for additional information  see non compliance with covenants in our facility  without waiver or amendment from the lenders  could adversely affect our ability to borrow under the facility above 

table of contents because of the capital intensive nature of our business  we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in our liquidity that may vary substantially over time 
our operations could require us to utilize large sums of working capital  sometimes on short notice and sometimes without assurance of recovery of the expenditures 
circumstances or events that could create large cash outflows include losses resulting from fixed price contracts  environmental liabilities  litigation risks  unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions  contract initiation or completion delays  political conditions  client payment problems  foreign exchange risks and professional and product liability claims 
our borrowing levels and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under our facility 
at august   we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately  million  approximately  million of which relates to our westinghouse bonds and is of limited recourse to us 
in addition  at august   letters of credit  domestic and foreign  issued for our account in an aggregate amount of million were outstanding and we had no borrowings under our facility 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt  which reduces the cash available for other business purposes  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and creating additional liens on our assets  limiting our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business  placing us at a competitive disadvantage if we are more leveraged than our competitors  making us more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions  and restricting us from making additional investments or acquisitions by limiting our aggregate debt obligations 
to the extent that new debt is incurred in addition to our current debt levels  the leverage risks described above would increase 
risks related to labor and employment our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  including engineers  skilled workers and key officers  could have an adverse effect on us 
our ability to attract and retain qualified professional and or skilled personnel in accordance with our needs  either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  is an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed personnel 
our ability to successfully execute our business strategy depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain skilled laborers and craftsmen in our pipe fabrication and construction businesses 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers  and we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers 
if we are unable to retain qualified personnel  the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled  which may require that we devote time and resources to identifying  hiring and integrating new employees 
in addition  the failure to attract and retain key employees  including officers  could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and conduct our business effectively 
work stoppages  union negotiations and other labor problems could adversely affect us 
at august   approximately of our employees were represented by labor unions 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
there is inherent risk that on going or future negotiations relating to collective bargaining agreements or union 
table of contents representation may not be favorable to us 
from time to time  we have also experienced attempts to unionize our non union shops 
such efforts can often disrupt or delay work and present risk of labor unrest 
we may be required to contribute cash to meet our underfunded pension obligations in certain multi employer pension plans 
domestically  we participate in various multi employer pension plans under union and industry wide agreements that  generally  provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 
absent an applicable exemption  a contributor to a multiemployer plan is liable  upon termination or withdrawal from a plan  for its proportionate share of the plan s underfunded vested liability 
funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension plans are subject to certain regulatory requirements and we may be required to make cash contributions which may be material to one or more of these plans to satisfy certain underfunded benefit obligations 
our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses 
safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation  however we often work on large scale and complex projects  frequently in geographically remote locations 
our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment  dangerous processes or highly regulated materials  and in challenging environments 
often  we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work 
many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts  and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria 
unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover  increasing project costs and raising our operating costs 
if we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and or if our procedures fail  our employees or others may suffer injuries 
although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health  safety and environmental procedures throughout our company  the failure to comply with such procedures  client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability 
other risk factors lawsuits and regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we  our directors and or certain of our current and former officers are named as a party to lawsuits and regulatory proceedings 
a discussion of our material lawsuits appears in note contingencies and commitments included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f although it is not possible at this time to predict the likely outcome of these actions  an adverse result in any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us 
litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
for additional information  see note contingencies and commitments and note accounting for claims  unapproved change orders and incentives on long term construction contracts included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights or if our technology becomes obsolete  our competitive position could be adversely impacted 
we believe that we are an industry leader by owning or having access to our technologies 
we protect our technology positions through patent registrations  license restrictions and a research and development program 
we may not be able to successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future  and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as us law 
because we license technologies from third parties  there is a risk that our relationships with licensors may terminate or 
table of contents expire or may be interrupted or harmed 
if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights  or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us  our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced 
additionally  if our technologies become obsolete  we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings  and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our clients 
for example  we believe that westinghouse s ap technology is a leading technology for nuclear power generation plants 
however  there are competing technologies  and it is likely that new technologies will be developed in the future 
we also believe that our induction pipe bending technology  know how and capabilities favorably influence our ability to compete successfully 
currently  this technology and our proprietary software are not patented 
even though we have some legal protections against the dissemination of this technology  including non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  our efforts to prevent others from using our technology could be time consuming  expensive and ultimately may be unsuccessful or only partially successful 
finally  there is nothing to prevent our competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technology

see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and part i  item a risk factors for a discussion of the risks  assumptions and uncertainties affecting these statements 
overview we achieved a number of significant milestones during fiscal year most notably  two of our domestic epc ap nuclear power projects began producing meaningful financial results and we continued our strong performance on our hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana 
additionally  our work in china on the first four ap nuclear reactors under construction continued to progress 
our fiscal year financial results were mixed with revenue and gross profit slightly lower than in fiscal year  while income before tax was significantly improved 
operating cash flow was strong although less than the record cash flow from fiscal year we maintained a record amount of cash and cash equivalents and unrestricted and restricted short term investments 
the global economic climate and an uncertain domestic regulatory framework negatively impacted the number and value of new awards our segments received  which in turn  may adversely affect the financial results for those businesses in the first half of fiscal year our power segment s financial results reflect increased activity on two of our domestic ap nuclear power projects as well as continued execution of epc projects for new coal and gas fired power plants 
we achieved certain milestones on our services contract for four new ap units in china in fiscal year  including the placement of the first nuclear concrete at all four units 
additionally  several structural modules have been set  including the cv bottom head at three of the four units and the cv nd ring on two units 

table of contents the experience gained in china will benefit our domestic ap nuclear projects as they reach similar stages of project execution 
we have also made progress in achieving price certainty in a number of key commodities  which resulted in positive revisions to our estimated cost at completion on a number of contracts 
our plant services segment achieved a slight increase in revenues and a significant increase in profits in fiscal year the segment benefited from a greater number and longer duration of fueling outages at us nuclear power plants for new and existing customers 
however  we believe major capital commitments at other industrial clients were delayed due to the global economic climate which offset the increased business volume from the nuclear plant outage work 
our e i segment generated strong revenue and earnings  primarily driven by increased volume in our federal sector for construction activity on our hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana and our mox project for the doe in south carolina 
these two projects continue to drive e i s earnings 
our e c segment experienced reduced revenues and earnings in fiscal year resulting primarily from a decline in new awards of high margin engineering services contracts and a shift in revenues in fiscal year shift toward lower margin epc work on a major international project 
we anticipate continued reduced revenues and profits during the first half of fiscal year for the e c segment 
similarly  our f m segment experienced reduced revenues in fiscal year as compared to the record set in fiscal year we believe the global economic conditions resulted in fewer projects being executed and delays in capital commitments in fiscal year which  in turn  increased market pricing pressure and reduced profit margins on our work 
our new orders bookings excluding the receipt of nuclear scope transferred from our power segment declined throughout the year 
the decline in new orders excluding the transfer of nuclear scope is likely to result in comparatively reduced revenues and profits during the first half of fiscal year finally  during fiscal year we completed our new state of the art module facility in lake charles  louisiana 
our consolidated financial results continue to be negatively impacted by significant non operating foreign exchange translation losses on our jpy denominated westinghouse bonds 
the translation loss occurs when the jpy appreciates against the usd 
in fiscal years and  we recorded pre tax losses of million and million  respectively  related to foreign currency translation losses on the jpy denominated bonds 
the exchange rate of the jpy to the us dollar at august  was as compared to as of august  consolidated results of operations consolidated revenues for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated revenues decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in revenues attributable to client furnished material in our e c segment in fiscal year for which we recognize no gross profit 
revenues also declined in our f m segment due to reduced business volumes 

table of contents consolidated gross profit for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated gross profit decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to decreases in our e c and f m segments 
e i s gross profit increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to increased construction activity on a hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana 
see segment results of operations below for additional information 
consolidated selling  general administrative expenses sg a for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated sg a decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of decreases in professional and contractor fees of approximately million and non income related taxes of approximately million 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in employee compensation and related costs 
consolidated interest expense for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated interest expense decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest expense associated with the jpy denominated bonds decreased approximately million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due primarily to our expensing in fiscal year the original issuance bond discount of million and the remaining deferred financing cost of million associated with the westinghouse bonds due to the occurrence of a toshiba event 
consolidated provision for income taxes for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal year was as compared to for fiscal year the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the mix of earnings between our domestic and foreign operations  and a lower provision for uncertain tax positions in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal year also includes a benefit of research and experimentation tax credits in submitted claims or filed returns that were included in the provision for uncertain tax positions 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective tax rate 

table of contents consolidated earnings losses from unconsolidated entities for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a million net of tax reduction in earnings related to our westinghouse equity 
consolidated net income loss attributable to shaw for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period the increase in consolidated net income in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due to the reduction in current fiscal year of the pre tax non cash foreign currency translation loss on the westinghouse bonds of million as well as the other factors discussed above

additionally  work continues on our services contract for four new ap nuclear power reactors in china 
however  reduced demand for electricity in the us and uncertainty regarding air emission regulations in the us contributed to a decline in our coal and air quality control businesses where we saw substantially reduced activities  opportunities and new awards throughout fiscal year revenues revenues decreased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the significant decline in volume in our aqc and coal business lines attributable to the substantial completion of several large projects in fiscal year when aggregated  the reduced activity on those projects resulted in decreased revenue of approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by increased volume on two contracts for four domestic ap nuclear reactors  two new build gas fired power plants  and our services contract for four new ap nuclear power reactors in china representing approximately million in increased revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  and gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were due to increased activity in fiscal year 
table of contents on domestic ap contracts and increased profitability in our coal business lines which  when aggregated  added million in gross profit in fiscal year compared to fiscal year additionally  we have made progress in achieving price certainty on a number of key commodities  which resulted in reductions to our estimated cost at completion on a number of contracts 
in fiscal year  we reported significantly increased estimated costs to complete two coal fired power plant projects  one of which amounted to million 
higher legal costs and reduced volumes in our aqc business line in fiscal year partially offset the increases in gross profit described previously 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase primarily resulted from the same factors affecting gross profit discussed above  as well as a slight decrease in the segment s general and administrative expenses in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year plant services segment our plant services segment generated increased revenue and profitability in fiscal year compared to fiscal year these increases were driven primarily by projects for nuclear power plant refueling outages for new and existing customers 
partially offsetting the increase in revenue and profits was a decline in the volume of construction projects due to an overall decline in client capital spending and significant competition in the process and industrial markets 
revenues revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to a greater number and longer duration of nuclear power plant refueling outages for new and existing customers of approximately million 
a decline in the volume of smaller project awards partially offset increased revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulting from a decline in overall construction spending and significant competition in the process and industrial markets 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to the increased number and length of nuclear refueling outages in fiscal year as well as a reduction of indirect expenses of approximately million compared to fiscal year fiscal year s gross profit and gross profit percentage were negatively impacted in the second quarter of fiscal by the resolution of a dispute with the owner of a major domestic power project 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the same factors affecting gross profit discussed above as well as lower general and administrative expenses 
e i segment our e i segment s revenues and profitability increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year these increases were driven primarily by our activities on our hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana  construction services for the temporary sand berms off the coast of louisiana and our mox project for the doe in south carolina 
the usace project should continue through fiscal year and the mox project should continue for several years  depending on client options for additional work 

table of contents revenues revenues increased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year primarily due to increased volumes of services provided to the us government  led by increased construction activity on the hurricane protection project for the usace  the temporary sand berm construction and our mox project 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year while gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage was primarily due to activity on a hurricane protection  sand berm and mox projects noted above 
gross profit and gross profit percentage also increased due to the overall volume increases and lower overhead costs as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior fiscal year 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the same factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
e c segment as anticipated  our e c segment results were adversely impacted by the current economic climate resulting in lower revenues and earnings in fiscal year as compared to the record levels in the fiscal year revenues for e c decreased from fiscal year primarily due to reduced volumes of client furnished materials and reimbursable costs which are invoiced to clients without profit and reduced revenues from engineering projects as a result of decreased new work awards 
we see signs of renewed client interest in the early phases of major capital investments such as studies and front end engineering and design contracts  which precede the engineering  procurement and construction phase of major projects  but the timing and award of these projects remains uncertain 
as a result  we expect e c s volume of business through the first two quarters of fiscal year to be similar to the second half fiscal year the remainder of fiscal year is dependent on our ability to book new work during the first half of fiscal year revenues revenues decreased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year due primarily to a decrease of million in the volume of reimbursable client furnished materials for which we recognize no gross profit or loss and a decline in engineering services projects due to lack of new awards 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased volume on a major international ethylene project in asia 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit is due to the lower volume of engineering contracts in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease in gross profit percentage is a result of lower volumes of higher margin engineering projects and increased activity from our major international ethylene project in asia which has a lower gross margin percentage than our engineering projects 
the reduced gross margin percentage was most prevalent during the fourth quarter of fiscal year when field costs increased on the international ethylene project 

table of contents income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
f m segment our f m segment experienced decreased business volumes in fiscal from the record levels in fiscal year the global economic downturn negatively impacted our end markets  particularly clients in the oil refining and chemical petrochemical industries with many projects being delayed into fiscal as a result  our non nuclear bookings and profits declined in fiscal we expect the downturn in volume and profits to continue into the first half of fiscal year but subsequently to improve to the extent that the modular assembly and pipe fabrication work associated with the ap work subcontracted from our power segment commences 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due to lower volumes resulting from lower bookings across the majority of our us operations as a result of global economic environment partially offset by higher revenues in our mexican operations 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage was primarily due to reduced client demand for pipe fabrication services  a more competitive pricing environment and the completion of higher margin contracts in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
investment in westinghouse segment the results of our investment in westinghouse segment include both our interest in westinghouse s reported earnings loss  and the gain loss on translating the jpy denominated westinghouse bonds used to partially fund the investment in westinghouse in october through our subsidiary  neh to the usd equivalent at the end of each fiscal period 
for fiscal years and  we incurred losses before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities of million and million in our investment in westinghouse segment 
these results do not include any westinghouse dividends 
because the westinghouse bonds are denominated in jpy  at the end of each fiscal period  gaap requires that we revalue for financial reporting purposes the jpy denominated westinghouse bond debt to its usd equivalent at the jpy us dollar exchange rate in effect at the end of each fiscal period  with the difference being recognized as a non cash gain or loss in our statement of operations for that fiscal period 
the losses in fiscal years and were primarily attributable to the non cash foreign currency translation losses of million and million  respectively  resulting from revaluing the jpy denominated westinghouse bonds to the usd equivalent at the end of the fiscal period 
as a result of the westinghouse bond holders having the ability to require us to exercise the put option to retire the bonds due to the toshiba event described previously  we reclassified the westinghouse bonds from long term to current liabilities in the third quarter of fiscal year additionally  we were required to 
table of contents expense a pre tax total of million in as interest expense  which included the million in pre tax unamortized original issuance bond discount as well as the million in unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the westinghouse bonds 
see item business for additional information 
our interest in westinghouse s earnings increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase was related to increases in revenues and operation profits in its nuclear services and nuclear power plants segments 
westinghouse maintains its accounting records for reporting to its majority owner  toshiba  on a calendar quarter basis with a march fiscal year end 
financial information about westinghouse s operations is available to us for westinghouse s calendar quarter periods 
as a result  we record our of westinghouse s earnings loss as reported to us by westinghouse based upon westinghouse s calendar quarterly reporting periods  or two months in arrears of our current reporting periods 
under this policy  the results of westinghouse s operations from july   through their calendar quarter ended june   were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august   and the results of westinghouse s operations from july   through their calendar quarter ended june   were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august  as noted previously  the westinghouse bonds are jpy denominated 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the impact of exchange rate changes on our jpy denominated cash interest payments on the westinghouse bonds 
we normally focus our hedge transactions to the jpy interest payments due within the following twelve months 
corporate corporate sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to the successful remediation of material weaknesses in fiscal year resulting in lower professional fees in the current fiscal year  lower non income related tax expenses in fiscal year  and lower compensation costs 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in health insurance costs 
segment analysis fiscal year compared to fiscal year power segment during  our power segment continued to execute major electric power generation and air emission reduction projects across the globe 
reduced demand for electricity in the us and the decline in the stock prices for electric utilities during likely adversely impacted electric utilities investment decisions during and may continue to impact those decisions going forward 
however  the segment s epc work on three contracts for six new ap nuclear power reactors in the us were either fully or partially released in while work continued on our services contract for four new ap nuclear power reactors in china 
the domestic nuclear epc contracts significantly increased this segment s backlog of unfilled orders while new awards for air quality control system contracts and new build coal projects significantly declined 
one new build coal petroleum coke fired generation facility was canceled and removed from backlog in the second quarter of fiscal year notwithstanding these changes to the power generation markets  the results for this segment were driven by epc projects for new coal fired  gas and nuclear power plants in the us as well as from air emission reduction projects at existing power plants 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year primarily due to the completion or near completion of several air quality control system projects in the us however  this decrease is partially offset by increased volume on new coal and gas construction projects  as well as the initial work on the three new nuclear construction projects in the us 
table of contents gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year these decreases were primarily due to significantly increased estimated costs to complete two coal fired power plant projects  one of which amounted to million that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year additionally  the decline in the volume of air quality control system projects in fiscal year versus fiscal year contributed to the comparative decline in gross profit 
income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above  as well as an increase in general and administrative expenses as our domestic nuclear work continues to advance 
plant services segment our plant services segment experienced reduced activity in fiscal year versus fiscal year  as the global recession adversely impacted the primary markets this segment serves 
we performed fewer refueling outages for our nuclear electric utility clients in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  and we also performed fewer projects for our refining  chemical  and petrochemical clients who we believe delayed capital commitments because of economic conditions 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year this decrease in revenues is primarily due to lower volume of activity in both our power and process business lines 
additionally  we completed a major capital construction project in fiscal year that was not replaced in gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decreases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to lower overall business volume as well as reduced margin resulting from the impact of a dispute resolution reached in the second quarter of fiscal with the owner of a major domestic power project 
also contributing to the comparative decline in annual gross profit and gross profit percentage was the fact that we completed a major capital construction project in fiscal year  which produced higher gross profits when compared to the maintenance services provided in fiscal year income loss before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes  minority interest  and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above  partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses resulting from various cost savings initiatives 
e i segment the financial results of our e i segment significantly improved during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  driven primarily by our hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana 
the e i segment benefited from increased us government spending during fiscal and is well positioned to compete for projects that may be funded under the arra in fiscal year 
table of contents revenues revenues increased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year primarily due to increased volumes of services provided to the us government  led by increased construction activity on the hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana and our mox project 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year while gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross profit is primarily due to increased construction activity on a hurricane protection project noted above

operating cash flow was generated by all operating segments during fiscal year except for our e c  corporate and investment in westinghouse segments 
operating cash flow was generated primarily by earnings in each segment  positive working capital movements  and the receipt of approximately million in dividends from our investment in westinghouse 
in addition to the dividends received from our investment in westinghouse  we also received a return of investment from westinghouse of approximately million 
our primary source of operating cash inflows is from collections of our accounts receivable  which are generally invoiced based upon achieving performance milestone prescribed in our contracts 
our outstanding accounts receivable ar and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings cie are reviewed monthly and tend to be due from high quality credit clients such as regulated utilities  government agencies  multinational oil companies and industrial corporations  independent and merchant power producers

many of our clients require that we issue letters of credit or surety bonds for work we perform 
our growth may be dependent on our ability to increase our letter of credit and surety bonding capacity  our ability to achieve timely release of existing letters of credit and surety bonds and or our ability to obtain from our clients more favorable terms reducing letter of credit and surety requirements on new work 
our need for letter of credit capacity may increase as we seek additional construction projects 
increases in outstanding performance letters of credit issued under our facility reduce the available borrowing capacity under our 
table of contents facility 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we increased the commitments under our facility and extended its duration until october see additional details below 
over the past three years  we have generated significant operating cash flow and currently have in excess of billion of cash and short term marketable securities 
our excess cash is generally invested in money market funds governed under rule a of the us investment company act of and rated aaa aaa by s p and or moody s  respectively  interest bearing deposit accounts with commercial banks rated at least a a or better by s p and or moody s  respectively publicly traded debt rated at least a a or better by s p and or moody s  respectively  with maturities up to two years at the time of purchase or publicly traded debt funds holding securities rated at least a a or better by s p and or moody s  respectively 
at august   the amounts shown as restricted cash and restricted short term investments in the accompanying balance sheet included approximately million used to voluntarily secure letters of credit and approximately million to secure insurance related contingent obligations in lieu of a letter of credit 
we expect to continue for the short term to voluntarily cash collateralize certain letters of credit in fiscal if the bank fees avoided on those letters of credit exceed the return on other investment opportunities 
in march and november  we made voluntary cash contributions to underfunded pension plans in the united kingdom totaling million approximately million and million approximately million  respectively 
approximately million of our cash at august   was held in our international operations 
we have the ability to return certain amounts of our overseas funds to the us but may incur incremental taxes under certain circumstances 
we continue to invest a portion of our excess cash to support the growth of our business lines 
in fiscal year  we invested approximately million for property and equipment  primarily for our new modular facility in louisiana  and for the purchase of heavy cranes used at large industrial construction sites 
in addition  during fiscal year  we made an investment of approximately million to a joint venture that will construct a pipe fabrication facility in the uae our strong cash position  combined with the global economic climate  has created opportunities for us to obtain market discounts and provide protection from potential future price escalation for our epc projects by undertaking an early procurement program 
accordingly  we have begun to procure certain commodities  subcontracts and construction equipment early in the life cycle of major projects 
if successful  this strategy will provide price and schedule certainty but requires that we expend our cash earlier than originally estimated under the contracts 
at august   we have expended approximately million under the early procurement program for fiscal year and are currently evaluating early procurement opportunities up to million for fiscal year it is our intent to balance any potential cancellation exposure associated with early procurements with our termination rights and obligations under the respective prime contracts with our clients and to help protect ourselves from suppliers failing to perform by requiring financial security instruments to support their performance 
however  we can provide no assurance that our intent to manage our cancellation exposure will be successful 
in addition  while we currently intend to pursue procurements of this magnitude during fiscal year  our ability to complete such purchases is subject to our ability to execute definitive purchase contracts as well as our ability to terminate this strategy should we identify other opportunities or needs that we determine are in our best interests to pursue 
we expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months through the use of cash generated from operations and existing cash balances 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve our forecasted cash flow  which could result in new borrowings under existing or future credit facilities
