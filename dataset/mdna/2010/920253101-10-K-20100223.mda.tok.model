general the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our utility support structures reporting structure to include oversight of sales and operating income of utility structures on a world wide basis 
accordingly  we have changed our segment reporting to match our internal reporting structure 
previously  sales and operating profit associated with utility support structure sales outside of north america were included in the engineered support structures segment 
financial information for and has been reclassified to conform to the presentation

the sales unit volume increase in utility was more than offset by lower unit sales volumes in our other reportable segments 
we believe these decreases were mainly due to the global economic recession that began in late and persisted throughout this economic weakness  especially in the us and europe  resulted in lower sales demand in the ess  irrigation and coatings segments 
sales demand in the irrigation segment was also adversely impacted by lower net farm income in  as compared with the net sales volume decrease was offset to a degree by the full year impact of acquisitions completed in approximately million 

table of contents average unit selling prices were slightly higher in  as compared with  due to steel cost increases that occurred throughout most of and reflected in sales shipments in throughout  pricing levels generally decreased as compared with late  due to pricing pressures associated with weaker sales demand and lower raw material prices 
gross profit margins gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales increased in fiscal  as compared with  despite generally lower sales volumes 
on a consolidated basis  this improvement was largely due to declining raw materials prices especially steel throughout on a segment basis  the utility segment realized significantly improved gross profit margins due to its significant sales volume increase in  as compared with in our other reportable segments  aggressive manufacturing cost control helped us maintain gross margins to some degree despite weaker sales demand and lower factory production levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a spending in increased as compared with due to increased salary and benefit costs approximately million  the full year effect of acquisitions completed in approximately million  and  increased deferred compensation expense related to the improved investment performance in the marketable securities underlying the deferred compensation plan as compared with of approximately million 
we recorded the related investment gains in these securities as miscellaneous in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended december  these increases were somewhat offset by currency translation effects approximately million  lower management incentive accruals in  as compared with approximately million  and  lower sales commissions due to lower sales in  as compared with approximately million 
the decrease in net interest expense for fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was due to a combination of lower interest rates on our variable rate debt in and decreased borrowing levels throughout miscellaneous income was higher in the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  due to improved investment performance in the assets in our deferred compensation plan approximately million and foreign currency transaction gains realized in the effective income tax rate in fiscal was slightly lower than  due to a reduction in our income tax contingency liabilities and the realization of additional income tax benefits in certain international tax jurisdictions in our cash flows provided by operations were million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with million in fiscal improved net earnings and working capital management in  as compared with  were the main reasons for the improved operating cash flow in 
table of contents engineered support structures ess segment the decrease in ess segment sales for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with fiscal  was mainly due to weaker sales demand in worldwide markets 
foreign currency translation effects approximately million also contributed to the decrease in segment sales 
these decreases were offset somewhat by the impact of acquisitions approximately million 
in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales were lower than levels due to decreased demand for lighting and traffic control support structures 
in particular  sales demand for lighting structures for residential and commercial outdoor lighting applications were lower in  as compared with  due to weaker residential and commercial construction activity that resulted from the global economic recession and tightness in credit markets 
net sales in the transportation market channel likewise were lower in as compared with in addition to the recession in the us economy  we believe that state budget deficits and uncertainty over the us federal highway funding legislation also contributed to weaker sales order flows and shipments in we believe that the lack of legislative activity on long term street and highway funding is negatively impacting street and highway project activity  because the amount and nature of any funding is uncertain 
we also believe that the impact from the us economic stimulus spending directed towards street and highway construction projects is not substantial  aside from some potential positive impact of financial aid provided to the various states  which could be used to fund street and highway construction projects 
in europe  sales for the fiscal year ended december  were comparable to the positive impact from the mitas and stainton acquisitions in late largely offset lower sales demand in our core markets due to economic weakness in europe and currency translation effects 
sales of specialty structures products in fiscal were lower than in north america  market conditions for sales of structures and components for the wireless communication market in were lower than  reflecting less aggressive wireless network enhancement activity by the major wireless carriers 
sales of wireless communication poles in china in were comparable to sales of sign structure products in were lower than  as this product line is being discontinued 
these sales decreases were offset to a degree by the acquisition of site pro site pro in july the decrease in operating income in the ess segment for fiscal was largely due to the decrease in sales volumes 
the lower raw material costs  operational improvements including employment and capacity reductions and the impact of acquisitions approximately million helped mitigate the operating income impact associated with lower sales 
segment sg a expense for the fiscal year ended december  was comparable with fiscal  as the impact from acquisitions approximately million and impairment charges incurred in the third quarter as part of our evaluation of the goodwill and other intangible assets assigned to our north american sign structure operations approximately million were offset somewhat by currency translation impacts approximately million and lower sales commissions associated with lower sales volumes approximately million 
utility support structures utility segment in the utility segment  the sales increase in fiscal  as compared with  was due to strong sales volume increases in steel and concrete high voltage transmission and substation structures and higher average sales prices 
we entered the fiscal year with a record backlog and the strong sales performance relates in part to the large backlog from year end in the us  our customers  who are mainly utility companies  are continuing their investment commitments in transmission and substation structures which began over the past several years to improve the reliability and capacity of the electrical grid in the us sales demand for pole structures for low voltage electrical distribution applications was weaker in  as compared with this weakness relates directly to the downturn 
table of contents in residential and commercial construction in the us that started in late due to the economic recession and credit crisis 
in international markets  sales volumes were higher  due mainly to project sales in developing countries 
order rates in the us in for transmission and substation structures lagged the record order rates in we believe that utility companies postponed transmission structure spending due to the economic recession in the us as a result  the sales backlog at the end of is much lower than at december sales of utility structures in china in fiscal were comparable to fiscal the improved operating income in fiscal  as compared with  related to the increased sales levels  improved operating leverage associated with higher sales volumes  lower raw material costs and a more favorable sales mix than the increase in sg a spending in  as compared with  was principally due to higher salary and employee benefit costs million  higher employee incentives approximately million associated with improved operating income of this segment and additional costs associated with developing international markets for our utility structures 
coatings segment the decrease in coatings segment sales in the fiscal year ended december  as compared with was predominantly due to decreased sales volumes from both internal and external customers along with lower selling prices due to lower per pound zinc costs in  as compared with the sales volumes in our galvanizing operations for the fiscal year ended december  was approximately lower than fiscal the decrease in sales demand was related to industrial economic conditions in our served markets due to the us economic recession 
operating income decreased in fiscal  as compared with  mainly the result of lower unit sales demand 
the impact of lower sales volumes was mitigated by cost reductions in factory operations and lower natural gas prices in sg a spending in fiscal was comparable to  as the impact of an acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of and higher employee compensation costs were offset by lower management incentive expense 
irrigation segment the sales decrease in the irrigation segment for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with the same period in  was mainly due to weaker sales volumes in both domestic and international markets 
in  lower farm commodity prices and net farm income in worldwide agricultural markets  as compared with  resulted in decreased demand for mechanized irrigation machines in global markets 
in addition  we believe that the global economic recession and an uncertain outlook for world economies caused customers to delay capital investments in irrigation technology in in international irrigation markets  the sales decrease in  as compared with  was broad based across most geographic markets 
in both north american and international markets  average selling prices were slightly lower than last year  due to price competition in our various markets and lower raw material prices 
currency translation effects also contributed to lower irrigation segment sales for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with approximately million 
the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with fiscal  was due to the effect of lower sales unit volumes and the associated operating deleverage realized as a result of lower sales and production levels 
the decrease in sg a spending in fiscal  as compared with  was due to lower incentive expense accruals related to decreased operating income this year approximately million and currency translation effects approximately million  offset somewhat by higher salary and employee benefits costs approximately million 

table of contents other these businesses mainly include our tubing and industrial fastener operations 
the decreases in sales and operating income in fiscal  as compared with  mainly related to weaker sales of industrial tubing due to the economic recession in the us this year 
net corporate expense the increase in net corporate expense for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with fiscal  were mainly due to increased deferred compensation liabilities related to higher investment returns on the assets of the deferred compensation plan approximately million  which is recorded in sg a expenses 
the investment gains and losses were recorded in miscellaneous in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively  and  increased employee incentive expense in fiscal  as compared with approximately million 
the increased incentive expense was principally due to improvement in our common stock price in  which resulted in higher recorded expense in our long term incentive plan 
fiscal compared with fiscal overview general the sales increase in  as compared with  was due to increased selling prices to recover higher raw material costs  sales unit volume increases  acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects 
the sales unit volume increase was due to improved sales demand in all reportable segments 
the largest sales unit volume increases were in the irrigation and coatings segments 
on a consolidated basis  sales unit volume increased approximately in  as compared with our costs for hot rolled steel products escalated rapidly throughout  resulting in higher costs for the items we manufacture 
where possible  we increased sales prices to our customers to recover these increased costs 
the gross margin gross profit as a percent of sales in the fiscal year was comparable to despite rapidly rising material prices  we were generally able to pass on these cost increases through higher selling prices to maintain gross margins 
on a segment basis in  improved gross margin in the coatings and utility segments offset weaker gross margin in the ess segment 
the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  mainly resulted from increased salary and benefit costs to support the increase in sales activity approximately million  net effect of acquisitions and divestitures approximately million  foreign currency translation effects approximately million 
these increases were somewhat offset by lower group medical expenses for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with approximately million and decreased deferred compensation expense related to the investment losses in the marketable securities underlying the deferred compensation plan approximately million 
these investment losses resulted in lower amounts due to plan participants and  accordingly  reduced compensation expense 
we recorded these 
table of contents investment losses as other expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  the impact of these investments on the consolidated statement of operations in the fiscal year was not significant 
all reportable segments contributed to the improved operating income in as compared with the irrigation  utility and coatings segments realized the largest increases in operating income in  as compared with net interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  was slightly higher than  as the effect of higher average borrowing levels in on interest expense were offset by lower interest rates on our variable rate debt in  as compared with the increase in miscellaneous expense in  as compared with mainly related to investment losses in the assets in our deferred compensation plan of million and foreign currency exchange transaction losses in certain international operations 
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended december  was higher as compared with our income tax rate in was lower than normal and was principally associated with the realization of certain income tax benefits on transactions that occurred in prior years 
these income tax benefits mainly related to the expiration of statutes of limitation 
other factors that contributed to a higher income tax rate in  as compared with  included higher taxes on our profits generated in china due to changes in their respective income tax laws in late and lower tax credits realized in the us in  as compared with our cash flows provided by operations were million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with million of cash provided by operations in the lower operating cash flows in principally resulted from increased accounts receivable and inventory in to support increased sales volume levels 
inventory levels also increased throughout due to rapidly rising steel prices and extended delivery times from our suppliers 
in response to these conditions  we increased inventory levels to ensure that we had materials on hand to meet our delivery commitments to our customers 
acquisitions and divestitures in and  we acquired the following businesses tehomet oy tehomet  a manufacturer of lighting structures located in finland and estonia acquired in april  penn summit tubular llc penn summit  a manufacturer of steel utility and wireless communication structures located in hazelton  pennsylvania acquired in january  west coast engineering group  ltd 
west coast  a manufacturer of steel lighting and wireless communication structures located in canada and the us acquired in february  site pro  inc site pro  a wireless communication components company headquartered in long island  new york acquired in july  gateway galvanizing gateway  a hot dipped galvanizing operation located near louisville  kentucky acquired in october  and  stainton metal co  ltd 
stainton  a manufacturer of steel lighting and wireless communication structures located in stockton on tees  england acquired in november in addition to these acquisitions  we acquired a small materials analysis  testing and inspection services business located in pittsburgh  pennsylvania and formed a pole manufacturing joint venture in turkey 

table of contents we report tehomet  west coast  site pro  the turkish joint venture and stainton as part of the ess segment 
we report penn summit and the engineering services company as part of the utility segment 
we report gateway as part of the coatings segment 
in addition  we divested certain operations that were included as part of our other businesses 
these operations included our tubing operation in waverly  nebraska  which we closed in late and our french machine tool accessory operation  which we sold to a third party in january the aggregate net increase of our net sales associated with these acquisitions and divestures for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with was approximately million 
the operating income net increase in fiscal over due to acquisitions and divestures was approximately million 
foreign currency translation for the fiscal year ended december   we realized approximately million of increased sales related to the financial statement translation of our international operations into us dollars 
these translation effects also resulted in an increase in operating income for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with of approximately million 
foreign currencies such as the euro and the brazilian real were stronger in relation to the us dollar through most of  as compared with accordingly  our sales denominated in those currencies translated to a higher amount of us dollars in  as compared with engineered support structures segment the sales increase for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with was due to the increased sales prices to recover higher steel costs approximately million  the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures approximately million and foreign currency translation impacts approximately million 
on a regional basis  sales unit volumes in north america were up modestly in  as compared with volumes in europe and china in were comparable with in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales in were higher than  due to a combination of the west coast acquisition and increased sales price increases 
in the transportation market channel  sales were slightly higher in  as compared with  as highway spending funded through the us federal and state programs was stronger than in sales in the commercial market channel in were slightly lower than  due predominantly to a weaker commercial construction market in the us sales of lighting structures to electrical utilities in lagged  due to the recent weakness in the residential housing market 
in europe  sales in local currency were higher in  as compared with due mainly to sales price increases to recover higher steel costs and the full year impact of the tehomet acquisition  offset somewhat by weaker volumes in france 
sales of lighting structures in china in were higher than  on both a quarterly and year to date basis  mainly due to continued market expansion and increased sales efforts 
sales of specialty structures products increased in  as compared with in north america  structure sales in the wireless communication market in improved over sales of wireless communication components increased due to the site pro acquisition 
sales of wireless communication poles in china were down in  as compared with we believe a major contributing factor to the decrease in wireless communication structures sales was reorganization of the chinese wireless communication industry  which is causing some delays in ordering patterns for structures 

table of contents segment operating income for the fiscal year ended december  was essentially unchanged from improved operating performance in the north american specialty structures operations approximately million  mainly due to the impact of actions taken in late to consolidate sign structure manufacturing operations  and the impact of the west coast  tehomet  site pro and mitas acquisitions approximately million contributed to segment operating income improvement 
these improvements were offset by lower factory productivity in our north american lighting structures operations and higher sg a expenses 
operating income from international operations was comparable to  as currency translation effects approximately million offset increased market development expenses and lower operating income in china  which included start up expenses related to our third plant in china 
this manufacturing facility began production in the third quarter of the impact of the stainton acquisition did not have a significant impact on operating income  as this acquisition was completed in november the increase in sg a expense for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was mainly due to increased salary and employee benefit costs approximately million  acquisitions approximately million  and  foreign currency translation approximately million 
utility support structures utility segment the sales increase in the utility segment for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was mainly due to the acquisition of penn summit and sales price increases implemented to recover higher steel costs 
unit sales of transmission  substation and distribution pole structures to utility customers in were comparable to however  sales order flow in this segment was very strong in  as sales backlogs at december  more than doubled from the end of the increase in demand for utility structures was the result of continued investment by utility companies to improve the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure in the united states 
sales in international markets likewise were higher in  as compared with  due to growing demand in china for utility structures and sales generated in other growing international markets 
gross profit increased in the fiscal year  as compared with  due to improved sales prices and factory operating performance this year 
the increases in sg a spending for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was primarily due to the acquisitions completed in million and increased salary  benefits and incentive expenses related to the higher sales activity and operating profit levels approximately million 
coatings segment coatings segment sales for the fiscal year ended december  were above  mainly due to increased demand for galvanizing services  offset to an extent by lower selling prices 
in our galvanizing operations  pounds of steel galvanized including intersegment sales in the fiscal year ended december  increased over by approximately 
the volume increases were due to stronger industrial economic conditions in our market areas  including increased galvanizing services provided to our other operations in the us the increase in operating income in the fiscal year  as compared with were principally due to lower zinc costs  the impact of higher galvanizing volumes and improvement in our utilization of zinc 
the main reasons for the sg a spending increases in  as compared with  were higher employee compensation costs related to increased sales activity in and increased incentive expenses associated with improved operating income this year 

table of contents irrigation segment the increase in irrigation segment sales for fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to a combination of improved sales volumes and higher selling prices to recover higher steel costs 
in global markets  higher farm commodity prices and net farm income in and resulted in improved demand for irrigation machines  although market demand in the fourth quarter of was below levels 
we believe that the slowdown late in was due in part to uncertainty in general economic conditions and lower farm commodity prices in the latter part of sales demand in international markets was stronger in  as compared with  in most geographic regions  with the most significant sales increases taking place in brazil  the middle east and the pacific rim 
in north america  demand for irrigation machines and service parts in was also enhanced due to machines that were damaged by a pattern of severe storms in the us the increase in operating income for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was due to improved sales volumes  sales price increases to offset steel cost increases and operating leverage realized through control of sg a spending 
the increase in sg a in  as compared with  was mainly attributable to increased employee incentives associated with improved operational performance approximately million and increased salary and benefit expense for additional administrative personnel approximately million 
other this mainly includes our tubing  industrial fastener and french machine tool accessories operations 
the sales decrease in the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was due to the sale of our machine tool accessory operation in early and the closure of a small tubing facility in late the impact of these actions on our operating income was not significant 
net corporate expense the decrease in net corporate expenses for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was mainly due to lower employee incentives  mainly due to a lower common stock price at year end  which is used to value long term management incentives approximately million  and  lower deferred compensation liabilities related to investment losses in the assets in the deferred compensation plan of approximately million 
this plan is a non qualified defined contribution plan 
the investment losses resulted in lower amounts due to the plan participants  which we recorded as a reduction of compensation expense 
we recorded these investment losses in the underlying plan assets as other expense in our consolidated statement of operations in liquidity and capital resources cash flows working capital and operating cash flows net working capital was million at fiscal year end  as compared with million at fiscal year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of december  as compared with at december  operating cash flow was million in  as compared with million in and million in the large increase in operating cash flow in  as compared with  resulted from reduced receivables and inventories in light of lower net sales in  as compared with in  inventory levels also increased throughout the year due to rapidly rising steel prices and extended delivery times from our suppliers 
in response to these conditions  we increased inventory 
table of contents levels to ensure that we had materials on hand to meet our delivery commitments to our customers 
in  conditions in steel industry improved and we placed a high emphasis on reducing inventory levels 
investing cash flows capital spending was million in  as compared with million in  and million in the largest capital spending projects related to manufacturing capacity additions in the ess and utility support structures segments 
due mainly to the growth in the utility support structures segment and the international side of the ess segment  we will be investing in manufacturing capacity to meet the market demand in these segments 
accordingly  we estimate that our capital expenditures to be approximately million 
we also made other investments and acquisitions in and in  we invested an aggregate of for the penn summit  west coast  site pro  mitas  matco  gateway and stainton acquisitions 
in  we invested an aggregate of million for the tehomet acquisition  the remaining of the outstanding shares of our canadian lighting structure manufacturing facility million and certain assets of a galvanizing operation in salina  kansas million 
financing cash flows total interest bearing debt decreased from million in to million as of december  most of this decrease was related to borrowings under our revolving credit agreement that we paid down during with our strong operating cash flow 
sources of financing and capital we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
we have an internal long term objective to maintain long term debt as a percent of invested capital at or below 
at december   our long term debt to invested capital ratio was  as compared with at the end of fiscal this internal objective is exceeded from time to time in order to take advantage of opportunities to grow and improve our businesses 
we believe the acquisitions described above were appropriate opportunities to expand our market coverage and product offerings and generate earnings growth 
dependent on our level of acquisition activity  we expect our long term debt to invested capital ratio to remain below in our priorities in use of future cash flows are as follows fund internal growth initiatives in core businesses pay down interest bearing debt invest in acquisitions connected to our core businesses or an existing competency return money to our shareholders through increased dividends or common stock repurchases at appropriate share prices 
table of contents our debt financing at december  consisted mainly of long term debt 
we also maintain certain short term bank lines of credit totaling million  million of which was unused at december  our long term debt principally consists of million of senior subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum and are due in may we are allowed to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at the following redemption prices stated as a percentage of face value redemption price until may  from may  until may  from may  until may  after may  these notes are guaranteed by certain of our us subsidiaries 
million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
we may increase the credit facility by up to an additional million at any time  subject to participating banks increasing the amount of their lending commitments 
the interest rate on our borrowings will be  at our option  either a libor based on a   or month interest period  as selected by us plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda  or  b the higher of the higher of a the prime lending rate and b the federal funds rate plus basis points plus in each case  to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda  or libor based on a week interest period plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement has a termination date of october  and contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement 
at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility  as we have an aggregate of million of standby letters of credit issued to third parties associated with insurance and contractual customer matters at december  these debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities  including capital expenditures 
our key debt covenants are that interest bearing debt is not to exceed x ebitda of the prior four quarters and that our ebitda over our prior four quarters must be at least x our interest expense over the same period 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements 
our businesses are cyclical  but we have diversity in our markets  from a product  customer and a geographical standpoint 
we have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity 
we have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures 
based on our available credit facilities and our history of positive operational cash flows  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs 

table of contents financial obligations and financial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  including capital lease obligations  various operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations as of december  are summarized as follows  in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt interest unconditional purchase obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt principally consists of the million of senior subordinated notes 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our bank revolving credit agreement at december  we also had various other borrowing arrangements aggregating million at december  obligations under these agreements may accelerate in event of non compliance with covenants 
operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business 
unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for zinc  aluminum and steel  all of which we plan to use in we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
at december   we had approximately million of various unrecognized income tax benefits that are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential tax payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
we also have certain commercial commitments related to contingent events that could create a financial obligation for us 
our commitments at december  were as follows in millions of dollars commitment expiration period other commercial commitments total amounts committed thereafter standby letters of credit total commercial commitments the above commitments are loan guarantees of a non consolidated subsidiary in argentina that is accompanied by a guarantee from the majority owner to us 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 

table of contents market risk changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
over the last several years  prices for these commodities have been volatile 
the volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply  government tariffs and the costs of steel making inputs 
we have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years 
our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible 
we use natural gas swap contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures except as described below  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates our interest bearing debt at december  was mostly fixed rate debt 
our notes payable and a small portion of our long term debt accrues interest at a variable rate 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have impacted our would have impacted our interest expense in and by approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are not material 
from time to time  as market conditions indicate  we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions that are in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations 
much of our cash in non us entities is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million in and million in we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions europe asia south america uk commodity risk natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories  especially in our coatings segment galvanizing operations  where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot dipped galvanizing process 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for of our us natural gas requirements for the upcoming months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on nymex futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged 
the objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden  significant increases in the price of natural gas 
at december   our open natural gas contracts were not significant 

table of contents critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history customer financial information reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customers financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impaired ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs costs for replacement parts other direct costs associated with warranty claims the number of product units subject to warranty claims in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumptions in our estimates are the rates we apply to those recent sales which is based on historical claims experience and our expected future warranty costs for products that are covered under warranty for an extended period of time 
our provision for various product warranties was approximately million at december  if our estimate changed by  the impact on operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value of the majority of our inventory 
approximately of inventory is valued at the lower of cost  determined by the lifo method 
the remaining of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method

table of contents in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in  we experienced substantially higher costs to produce inventory than in the prior respective years  due mainly to higher cost for steel and steel related products 
this resulted in higher cost of goods sold and lower operating income in of approximately million than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
in and  prices decreased and operating income would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional inventory write downs may be required 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from to years 
we have identified eight reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill and we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which coincides with our strategic planning process 
we assess the value of our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the annual free cash flow 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under current accounting standards  we rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
the valuation of all of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by a substantial margin 
accordingly  no further valuation of our reporting units was necessary 
if our assumptions about intangible assets change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe the assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
our reporting units are all cyclical and their sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year 
in the evaluation of our reporting units  we look at the long term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value  which requires management judgment 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names 
we assess the values of these assets apart from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing 
we use the relief from royalty method to evaluate our trade names  under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value 
the most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales  the royalty rate and the after tax discount rate 
for our evaluation purposes  the royalty rates used vary between and of sales and the after tax discount rate of  which we estimate to be our after tax cost of capital 
in  impairment charges of million were recorded in connection with our decision to exit our sign structure operation 

table of contents income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income expectations and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made 
likewise  if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets relating mainly to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  with a valuation allowance of million 
in  we reduced our valuation allowances by net million  resulting in a decrease in our income tax expense of approximately million 
these changes occurred because we determined that  based on facts and circumstances  the realization of these deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
in  the most significant decrease in our valuation allowances that affected our income tax expense related to the realization of operating loss carryforwards due to the strong performance of our mexican utility support structures operation 
we established a million valuation allowance in related to the utilization uncertainty of these net operating loss and asset tax carryforwards due to changes in mexican tax law 
at that time  we determined that  based on the new tax law  we would not likely be able to realize the full value of these carryforwards 
accordingly  we established the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets 
if circumstances related to our deferred tax assets change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate 
the tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues 
we include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies 
if our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience  our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period
