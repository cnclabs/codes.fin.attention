overview and background we were incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of hitachi  ltd  or hitachi  in september of in july of  clarity partners  lp and related investment vehicles invested in us and we became a majority owned subsidiary of hitachi 
in october  we acquired hitachi s opto device business and expanded our product line into select industrial and commercial markets 
in june  we acquired pine photonics communication inc  or pine  and expanded our product line of sfp transceivers with data rates less than gbps that are sold to telecommunication and data communication customers 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of common stock on the nasdaq market 
on january   we completed our acquisition of stratalight communications  inc stratalight  which expanded our product line to include gbps subsystems 
we presently have sales and marketing offices in the us  europe  japan and china  which are strategically located in close proximity to our major customers 
we also have research and development facilities that are co located with each of our manufacturing facilities in the us and japan 
in addition  we use contract manufacturing partners that are located in china  japan  the philippines  taiwan  thailand and the us certain of our contract manufacturing partners that assemble or produce modules are strategically located close to our customers contract manufacturing facilities to shorten lead times and enhance flexibility 
acquisition of stratalight on january   we completed our acquisition of stratalight 
the aggregate consideration for such acquisition consisted of  shares of common stock and million in cash  including the impact of net 
table of contents purchase price adjustments pursuant to the merger agreement 
for the years ended march  and  stratalight s operations contributed sales of million and million  respectively  and favorably impacted our gross margin percentage as sales of stratalight products generally have higher relative margins 
we also experienced incremental increases of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses related to the stratalight operations 
during the year ended march   in connection with the acquisition of stratalight  we expensed million of in process research and development costs  and following the completion of the acquisition  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
sales through our direct sales force supported by manufacturer representatives and distributors  we sell products to many of the leading network systems vendors throughout north america  europe  japan and asia 
our customers include many of the top telecommunications and data communications network systems vendors in the world 
we also supply components to several major transceiver module companies and we sell to select industrial and commercial customers 
sales to telecommunication and data communication customers  our communication sales  accounted for  and of our total revenues during each of the years ended march   and  respectively 
also during each of the years ended march   and  sales of our communications products with gbps or lower data rates  which we refer to as our gbps and below products  represented  and of total revenues  respectively  while sales of our communications products with gbps or higher data rates  which we refer to as our gbps and above products  represented  and of total revenues  respectively 
the term sales when used herein in reference to our gbps and above products includes revenues received pursuant to development agreements 
the number of leading network systems vendors that supply the global telecommunications and data communications markets is concentrated  and so  in turn  is our customer base 
for the year ended march   our top two customers  cisco systems inc and subsidiaries cisco and nokia siemens networks nsn  accounted for in the aggregate of our consolidated sales 
although we continue to attempt to expand our customer base  we anticipate that a small number of these customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales 
during the years ended march   and  sales attributed to north america represented  and of total revenues  sales attributed to europe represented  and of total revenues  sales attributed to japan represented  and of total revenues  and sales attributed to asia pacific excluding japan represented  and of total revenues  respectively 
because certain sales transactions and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen  our revenues are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  for the year ended march   and   and of our revenues were denominated in japanese yen  respectively 
to the extent we continue to generate a significant portion of our revenues in currencies other than the us dollar  our revenues will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
cost of sales and gross margin our cost of sales primarily consists of materials including components that are either assembled at one of our three internal manufacturing facilities or at one of several of our contract manufacturing partners or procured from third party vendors 
because of the complexity and proprietary nature of laser manufacturing  and the advantage of having our internal manufacturing resources co located with our research and development staffs  most of the lasers used in our optical module and component products are manufactured in our facilities in komoro and totsuka  japan 
our materials include certain parts and components that are purchased from a limited number of suppliers or  in certain situations  from a single supplier 
our cost of sales also includes labor costs for employees and contract laborers engaged in the production of our components and the assembly of our finished goods  outsourcing costs  the cost and related depreciation of manufacturing equipment  as well as manufacturing overhead costs  including the costs for product warranty repairs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 

table of contents our cost of sales is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our costs and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in japanese yen 
our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen during the years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
the percentage decline during the years ended march  and was primarily attributable to the contribution of cost of sales from the stratalight operations  which were denominated in us dollars  and our ability to procure more raw materials denominated in us dollars 
our gross margins vary among our product lines and are generally higher on our gbps and above and longer distance gbps products 
our gross margins are also generally higher on products where we enjoy a greater degree of vertical integration with respect to the subcomponents of such products 
our overall gross margins primarily fluctuate as a result of our overall sales volumes  changes in average selling prices and product mix  the introduction of new products and subsequent generations of existing products  manufacturing yields  our ability to reduce product costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our gross margins are also impacted by amortization of acquired developed technology resulting from the acquisition of stratalight 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel related to the design  development and quality testing of new products or enhancement of existing products  as well as outsourced services provided by hitachi s research laboratories pursuant to our contractual agreements 
we incurred million  million and million of expenses in connection with these agreements during the years ended march   and  respectively 
in addition  our research and development expenses primarily include the cost of developing prototypes and material costs associated with the testing of products prior to shipment  the cost and related depreciation of equipment used in the testing of products prior to shipment  and other contract research and development related services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our employees that perform our sales and related support  marketing  supply chain management  finance  legal  information technology  human resource and other general corporate functions  as well as internal and outsourced logistics and distribution costs  commissions paid to our manufacturers representatives  professional fees and other corporate related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses will also be impacted by the continuing costs associated with pending litigation 
during the year ended march   we experienced a decrease in costs as we realigned our selling  general and administrative resources on april  in response to the weak macroeconomic environment at that time and to achieve synergies associated with the integration of stratalight 
during the year ended march   we experienced an increase in costs as a result of the stratalight acquisition  restructuring activities and the legal expenses associated with defending against class action litigation 
impairment of goodwill as a result of the significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and the significant decrease in our market capitalization  for the year ended march  we recorded aggregate write downs of goodwill of million attributable to the previously completed acquisitions of stratalight and pine 

table of contents inventory certain of our more significant customers have implemented a supply chain management tool called vendor managed inventory vmi that requires suppliers  such as us  to assume responsibility for maintaining an agreed upon level of consigned inventory at the customer s location or at a third party logistics provider based on the customer s demand forecast 
notwithstanding the fact that we build and ship the inventory  the customer does not purchase the consigned inventory until the inventory is drawn or pulled by the customer or third party logistics provider to be used in the manufacture of the customer s product 
though the consigned inventory may be at the customer s or the third party logistics provider s physical location  it remains inventory owned by us until the inventory is drawn or pulled  which is the time at which the sale takes place 
given that under such programs we are subject to the production schedule and inventory management decisions of the customer or the third party logistics provider  our participation in vmi programs generally requires us to carry higher levels of finished goods inventory than we might otherwise plan to carry 
as of march  and  inventories included inventory consigned to customers or their third party logistics providers pursuant to vmi arrangements of million and million  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to taxation in the united states  japan and various state  local and other foreign jurisdictions 
during the year ended march   the internal revenue service completed an examination of our us income tax returns for the years ended march  and march   the state of new jersey completed an examination of our new jersey corporate business tax returns for the years ended march  through march   and the german tax authorities completed an examination of our german tax returns for the years ended march  through march  there were no adjustments proposed and all returns were accepted as filed 
our japan tax returns have been examined by the japan tax authorities through the year ended march  on february   marubeni corporation filed a schedule g a reporting that  as of december   it beneficially owned  shares of opnext common stock  and amending the schedule g it had previously filed on february   which had reported that as of september   it beneficially owned  shares of our common stock 
the events reported in such filing  when taken together with other changes in ownership of our common stock by its five percent or greater stockholders during the prior three year period  constitute an ownership change for us as that term is defined in section of the code  with the result of limiting the availability of our net operating loss carryforwards and other related tax attributes nols for future use 
as a result of the ownership change that occurred as of december   our us federal and state nols have been reduced by million and million  respectively 
our us federal and state nols had been previously reduced by million and million  respectively  as a result of prior acquisitions 
after giving effect to such reductions  we had us federal  state and foreign nols of million  million and million  respectively  at march  of the nols at march   million of us federal nols and million of state nols are subject to annual limitations in the amounts of million and million  respectively  while the remaining nols may be carried forward to offset future taxable income without limitation 
factors that may influence future results of operations global economic conditions the credit markets and the financial services industry continue to experience significant volatility characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions  increased volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  concern over the economic stability of certain economies in europe and a significant level of intervention from the united states and other governments  as applicable 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term or widespread recession  unemployment  energy costs  geopolitical issues including government deficits  the availability and cost of credit  and reduced consumer confidence have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for most developed and emerging economies 
while recent economic data reflect a stabilization of the economy  credit 
table of contents markets  the cost and availability of credit may continue to reflect volatility and uncertainty 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and global economies could restrict our ability and the ability of our customers to refinance indebtedness  increase the costs of borrowing  limit access to capital necessary to meet liquidity needs and materially harm operations or the ability to implement planned business strategies 
with respect to our customers  these factors could also negatively impact the timing and amount of infrastructure spending  further negatively impacting our sales 
cost reduction actions on april   we announced certain plans to reduce our cost structure and operating expenses  including  but not limited to an approximately ten percent reduction in our global workforce  elimination of bonuses for the fiscal year ended march   a ten percent reduction in executive salaries and director cash compensation  a five percent reduction in salaries for other employees  and suspension of our matching contribution to the k plan  each for a period of not less than six months 
the ten percent reduction in executive salaries and director cash compensation  the five percent reduction in salaries for other employees and the suspension of our matching contribution to the k plan  were each subsequently extended through the end of the fiscal year ended march  in addition  in october we further reduced our global workforce by approximately five percent 
these actions  together with synergies associated with the stratalight acquisition would have reduced our annualized cost structure and operating expenses for the year ended march  by approximately million as compared to the pro forma financial results for the year ended march   assuming the acquisition of stratalight had occurred as of april  as of april   executive and other employee salaries and director cash compensation were restored to their levels prior to the reductions and are expected to increase our annualized cost and operating expense structure by approximately million 
our matching contribution to the k plan remains suspended pending further determination 
sales our sales are affected by capital spending of our customers for telecommunications and data communications networks and for lasers and infrared leds used in select industrial and commercial markets 
the primary markets for our products continue to be characterized by increasing volumes 
the increasing demand for our products is primarily driven by increases in traditional telecommunication and data communication traffic and increasing demand for high bandwidth applications  such as video and music downloads and streaming  on line gaming  peer to peer file sharing and iptv  as well as new industrial and commercial laser applications 
the increased unit volumes as service providers deploy network systems has contributed along with intense price competition among optical component manufacturers  excess capacity  and the introduction of next generation products to the market for optical components continuing to be characterized by declining average selling prices 
in recent years  we have observed a modest acceleration in the decline of average selling prices 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will continue to decrease in future periods  although we cannot predict the extent of these decreases for any particular period 
our sales are also impacted by our ability to procure critical component parts for our products from our suppliers 
during the last several years  the number of suppliers of components has decreased significantly and  more recently  demand for components has increased rapidly 
any supply deficiencies relating to the quality or quantities of components we use to manufacture our products can adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations 
for example  during the quarter ended march  we experienced significant limitations on the components available from certain of our suppliers  resulting in losses of anticipated sales and the related revenues 
while we cannot predict the duration or extent of these supply limitations  we anticipate that such limitations will continue to impact us to some extent at least through the first half of our fiscal year ending march  our sales are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because certain sales transactions and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen 
our sales denominated in us dollars represented  and of our revenues  and our sales denominated in japanese yen represented  and of our revenues  for the years ended march   and 
table of contents  respectively 
to the extent we generate sales in currencies other than the us dollar  our future sales will be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and could be materially adversely affected 
during the year ended march   we began to enter into development agreements to design  develop and manufacture complex products  primarily gbps and gbs optical modules and subsystems  according to the specifications of the customer 
given that such agreements may in the future represent significant revenue for us  the timing of execution and delivery on the requirements of any such agreement may have a substantial effect on our ability to recognize revenue for a particular period 
in addition  since the receipt of payments and recognition of revenue pursuant to such development agreements are generally subject to the completion of milestones  the revenue related to any such agreement may be subject to deferral or may not be recognized at all if the relevant milestone is not achieved 
finally  since the revenue associated with such agreements can have nominal corresponding cost of sales  these agreements can have a substantial effect on our future gross margin during the period in which such revenue and associated cost of sales is recognized 
cost of sales and gross margins our cost of sales is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our costs and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in japanese yen 
the percentage of our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen during the years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
the percentage decline during the year ended march  was primarily attributable to our acquisition of stratalight  as well as the fact that we procured more raw materials in us dollars 
while we anticipate that we will continue to have a substantial portion of our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen  we expect the percentage of cost of sales denominated in japanese yen to diminish as we plan to expand the use of contract manufacturers outside of japan and procure more raw materials in us dollars 
in recent periods  certain of our products that operate at gbps data rates have generated reduced gross margins  which reduced margins we believe are attributable to  among other factors  the increased average age of such products  delays in the development of certain internal subcomponents  the level of vertical integration  as well as intensified competition in such product groups 
to the extent that we are unable to introduce  or experience delays in introducing  the next generation of such products  or to the extent we are unsuccessful in achieving a desirable level of vertical integration with respect to the subcomponents of such products  we may continue to experience diminished gross margins in connection with the sales of such products 
we experienced several sequential quarterly declines in sales of our gbps subsystems products during the year ended march  although sales of these products improved during the quarter ended march  as compared to the prior quarter  reoccurrence of this unfavorable sales trend could negatively affect future gross margins  given that our gross margins are generally higher on our gbps and above products 
research and development expense our research and development costs increased during the year ended march  as a result of the full year contribution of stratalight s operations 
in the future  these costs will vary with our efforts to meet the anticipated market demand for our new and planned future products and to support enhancements to our existing products 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended march   we experienced a decrease in costs as we realigned our selling  general and administrative resources on april  in response to the macroeconomic environment existing at that time  and to achieve synergies associated with the integration of stratalight 
realignment actions included a temporary reduction of executive and other employee salaries and director cash compensation which were reinstated on april  we expect that our future selling  general and administrative expenses will generally fluctuate with sales 
table of contents volumes and be impacted by the reinstatement of executive and other employee salaries and director cash compensation  as well as  continuing costs associated with pending litigation significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  warranties and allowances revenue is derived principally from the sales of our products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists usually in the form of a purchase order  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured based on the creditworthiness of the customer and certainty of customer acceptance 
these conditions generally exist upon shipment or upon notice from certain customers in japan that they have completed their inspection and have accepted the product 
we participate in vmi programs with certain of our customers  whereby we maintain an agreed upon quantity of certain products at a customer designated warehouse 
revenue pursuant to the vmi programs is recognized when the products are physically pulled by the customer  or its designated contract manufacturer  and put into production 
simultaneous with the inventory pulls  purchase orders are received from the customer  or its designated contract manufacturer  as evidence that a purchase request and delivery have occurred and that title has passed to the customer at a previously agreed upon price 
we sell certain of our products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost or the issuance of a credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  ranging from one year to five years 
in addition to accruing for specific known warranty exposures  we accrue the estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
our management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or as other information becomes available 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based upon historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable and actual write off history  as well as assessments of customers creditworthiness 
changes in the financial condition of customers could have an effect on the allowance balance required and result in a related charge or credit to earnings 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  including inventory consigned to our customers and our contract manufacturers 
inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value 
estimates of realizable value are based upon management s analyses and assumptions  including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
we typically use a month rolling forecast based on factors  including  but not limited to  our production cycles  anticipated product orders  marketing forecasts  backlog  shipment activities and inventories owned by us but part of vmi programs and held at customer locations 
if market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates  we may require additional inventory write downs 
if demand is higher than expected  inventories that had previously been written down may be sold 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at march  and  management considered recent operating results  the near term earnings expectations  and the highly competitive nature of our markets in making this assessment 
at the end of each of the respective years  management determined that it was more likely than not that the full tax benefit of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
accordingly  full valuation allowances have been provided against the net deferred tax assets 
there can be no assurance that deferred tax assets subject to our valuation allowance will ever be realized 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in estimating future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other groups 
assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties 
our evaluations for the years ended march   and indicated that there were no impairments 
goodwill and business combinations goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
we use a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then the goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
based upon the impairment analyses performed during the year ended march   we recorded aggregate goodwill impairment charges of million attributable to the acquisitions of stratalight and pine 
goodwill was at march  and  and million at march  stock based incentive plans all equity based payments  including grants of employee stock options  are recognized in our financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our share based awards utilizing the 
table of contents black scholes pricing model 
the fair value of the awards is amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value calculations involve significant judgments  assumptions  estimates and complexities that impact the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in current and future periods 
the factors include the time period our stock based awards are expected to remain outstanding has been determined based on the average of the original award period and the remaining vesting period 
our expected term assumption for awards issued during the years ended march   and was years  years and years  respectively 
as additional evidence develops from our option activity  the expected term assumption may be refined to capture more relevant trends 
through december   the future volatility of our stock was estimated based on the median calculated value of the historical volatility of companies believed to have similar market performance characteristics to ours 
use of comparable companies was necessary during this period since we did not possess a sufficient stock price history 
subsequent to december   we estimated volatility based on our historical stock prices 
the expected volatility assumption for awards issued during the years ended march   and was  and  respectively 
a dividend yield of zero has been assumed for awards issued during the years ended march   and based on our actual past experience and the fact that we do not anticipate paying a dividend on our shares in the near future 
we have based our risk free interest rate assumption for awards issued during the years ended march   and on the implied weighted average yields of  and  respectively  available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent expected term 
forfeiture rates for awards issued during the years ended march   and have been estimated based on our actual historical forfeiture trends of approximately over their expected terms 
compensation expense for all employee stock based awards was million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the periods reported 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
these estimates include assessments of the ability to collect accounts receivable  the use and recoverability of inventory  the realization of deferred tax assets  expected warranty costs  fair value of stock awards  purchased tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in business combinations  and estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization periods of tangible and intangible assets  among others 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and the estimates will change under different assumptions or conditions

total sales increased million  or  to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march   primarily as a result of a million increase in sales of stratalight products and a million increase from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by lower sales volumes of other communication and industrial and commercial products as well as lower average selling prices 
for the year ended march   sales of our gbps and below products decreased million  or  to million  while gbps and above sales increased million  or  to million 
the decrease in sales of our gbps and below products primarily resulted from decreased demand for our pin tunable and fixed wavelength  xenpak and sfp modules  partially offset by higher demand for our xfp products 
the increase in gbps and above sales primarily resulted from the acquisition of stratalight

gross margin 
gross margin decreased million  or  to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march  gross margin for the year ended march  included negative effects of million from increased acquired developed technology amortization associated with the stratalight acquisition  and million attributable to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate

during the years ended march  and  gross margin included charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march  this decline was primarily attributable to higher per unit manufacturing costs derived from lower sales volumes  lower average selling prices  higher acquired developed technology amortization and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and hedging programs  partially offset by higher relative margins from sales of stratalight products  lower fixed manufacturing  material and outsourcing costs as well as lower excess and obsolete inventory and warranty charges 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march   including a million increase attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily the result of the acquisition of stratalight  and was partially offset by reduced outsourcing services provided by hitachi s research laboratories  as well as lower employee and material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march   including a million increase attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was principally attributable to lower employee liquidity bonus plan costs associated with the acquisition of stratalight  as well as lower commission  logistics  litigation  bad debt and employee costs  partially offset by the full year impact of selling general and administrative costs resulting from the acquisition of stratalight 
impairment of goodwill 
as part of the annual assessment of goodwill completed during the quarter ended march   there were significant indicators to conclude that an impairment of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of stratalight on january  may have occurred 
this conclusion was based on the significant decrease in our market capitalization and a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment from the time of the acquisition announcement on july  through march  we concluded in the impairment analysis that the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the stratalight acquisition exceeded its fair value 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the quarter ended march   which represented the full amount of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition 
during the quarter ended december   there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis  including a significant decrease in our market capitalization and a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment largely caused by the widespread unavailability of business and consumer credit 
based upon the interim goodwill impairment analysis conducted  an impairment was indicated and we recorded a million charge  which represented the full amount of goodwill recorded in connection with the pine acquisition 
as a result of such impairments  goodwill was at march  and acquired in process research and development 
we incurred million of in process research and development expenses for the year ended march  related to the stratalight acquisition 
we incurred no in process research and development expenses for the year ended march  amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles related to the acquisition of stratalight was million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively
