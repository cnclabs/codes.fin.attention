item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global leader in innovative technologies for wireless and wired communications products that are used by a broad base of customers  including manufacturers of personal computers  or pcs  networking equipment and consumer electronics devices 
we combine our wireless and wired systems and software expertise with our high performance radio frequency  or rf  mixed signal and digital semiconductor design skills to provide highly integrated chipsets that are manufactured on low cost  standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  processes 
our ability to design radios in semiconductors using standard cmos processes provides us with increased manufacturing flexibility and  we believe  a competitive advantage 
our product portfolio includes solutions for wlan  mobile wlan  plc  ethernet  bluetooth and gps 
an element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings  augment our engineering workforce  and enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including acquisitions and other business combination transactions  strategic partnerships and the purchase or sale of assets 
the acquisitions made in  and were as follows intellon  a public us fabless semiconductor company  specializing in plc solutions  which we acquired in december  u nav  a privately held fabless semiconductor company based in california specializing in gps solutions and software that enable mobile location based products and services  substantially all of which was acquired in december  and attansic  a taiwan headquartered  provider of fast and gigabit ethernet solutions to the personal computing and networking markets  substantially all of which we acquired in december and the remainder in november the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
the revenue and operating results contributed by intellon during were not material 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to these acquisitions 
the semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly cyclical and has  from time to time  experienced significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
the industry experienced a significant downturn during the recent global recession 
these downturns are frequently characterized by decreases in product demand  excess customer inventories  and accelerated erosion of prices 
these factors could cause substantial fluctuations in the revenue and results of our operations as evidenced by the and sequential decreases in our revenue during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  respectively 
in addition  during these downturns some competitors may become more aggressive in their pricing practices  which would adversely impact our gross profits 
any downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged  and any failure of the industry or wired and wireless communications markets to fully recover from downturns could negatively impact the revenue  business  financial condition and our results of operations 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship sufficient products to meet our customers purchase requests 
accordingly  our operating results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry  which could cause large fluctuations in our stock price 
although conditions in the semiconductor industry have recently improved and we have experienced sequential revenue growth during the second  third and fourth quarters of  there is no assurance that this trend will continue or at what rate 
revenue 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of wired and wireless chipsets 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
original equipment manufacturers  or oems  utilize our chipsets in developing their wireless and wired system solutions such as access points  routers  wired and wireless switches  embedded laptop clients  handsets  cardbus  minicards  hand held and console video game devices  set top boxes  powerline adapters and pnds 
some oems purchase chipsets directly from us and manufacture their products 
other oems utilize original design manufacturers  or odms  to design and build subsystem products that the oem then purchases from the odm and incorporates into the oem s system solution 
accordingly  we ship our products either directly to the oem or to the odm based on the requirements of each oem 
purchase orders are received from an oem or an odm and we generally recognize revenue based on the shipment of chipsets to this customer 
a single odm usually provides our chipsets to numerous oems 
however  we attempt to maintain a close relationship with the target oem to monitor end market demand 
due to the use of odms  our direct customer base is relatively concentrated  although we believe that the number of total oems who purchase our chipsets through odms is broader 
we anticipate that we may continue to experience changes in our odm customer base as our end customers change odms for a variety of reasons while still using our chipsets 
we provide customer incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue when we ship product to the customers based on approved quotes provided to the customer 
estimating incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates are adjusted on a quarterly basis to reflect actual sales data submitted by customers 
these adjustments may have the effect of significantly increasing or decreasing net revenue in particular periods 

table of contents we defer recognition of revenue and the related cost of goods sold on shipments to distributors that have rights of return or price protection privileges on unsold products until the products are sold by the distributors to their customers 
price protection rights grant distributors the right to a credit in the event of declines in the price of our products 
as of december   we did not conduct any business with customers that had arrangements providing them with rights of return  other than for normal warranty returns  or price protection that would have required deferral of revenues upon shipment 
during the year ended december   hon hai precision industry co 
ltd and nintendo co  ltd 
accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
during the year ended december  and  hon hai precision industry co 
ltd accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to have major concentrations of sales to a relatively small number of odm and oem customers 
substantially all of our sales are to customers outside the us and canada 
sales to customers in asia accounted for  and of net revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
because many of our odm customers are located in asia  we anticipate that a majority of our revenue will continue to come from sales to customers in that region 
although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in asia  we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers are then sold through to oems outside of asia 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold relates primarily to the purchase of silicon wafers  costs associated with assembly  test and inbound and outbound shipping of our chipsets  fluctuations in the price of raw materials such as gold used in the manufacturing of our chips  costs of personnel  materials and occupancy associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  royalty costs and write downs to state inventory at the lower of cost or market caused by product obsolescence and transitions from older to newer products 
additionally  our cost of goods sold includes accruals for estimated warranty obligations  which we record when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty obligations are adjusted each period to reflect actual warranty experience 
because we do not have long term  fixed supply agreements  our wafer  assembly and test costs are subject to changes based on the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from foundries  we also typically bear the yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into finished goods 
research and development 
research and development expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs related to research and development employees and contractors  mask and reticle costs  prototype wafers  software and computer aided design software licenses  intellectual property license costs  reference design development costs  development testing and evaluation costs  regulatory testing costs  depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  public relations  promotional and other marketing expenses  expenses for travel  trade shows  depreciation and amortization and allocated occupancy costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for general and administrative personnel  legal and professional fees  charges related to allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization and allocated occupancy costs 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to acquired identified intangible assets  which are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to five years for purchased technology  two to seven years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
acquisition related charges 
acquisition related charges include expenses incurred in connection with our acquisition activities including legal and accounting costs  investment banking costs  government filing fees and severance and stock based compensation costs related to employees terminated post acquisition 
beginning january   as a result of changes in accounting standards see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition consideration and are expensed as incurred 
previously  acquisition related transaction costs were capitalized as part of the purchase price 
interest income and expense 
interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment balances and realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities and auction rate securities 
impairment of long term investments 
impairment of long term investments relates to the other than temporary  non operating write down of the carrying value of our investments in auction rate securities and the related perpetual  non cumulative preferred stock  or preferred stock  that resulted from the involuntarily exchange of certain auction rate securities  these auction rate securities were rated aaa and aa at the date of purchase 
the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the failure of these markets and the exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
all of our auction rate securities have been subject to multiple auction processes for which there have been insufficient bidders on the scheduled 
table of contents rollover dates and the auctions have subsequently failed 
the investment bank that organized the auctions for these securities filed for bankruptcy during the three months ended september   and since such time  no auctions have occurred 
additionally  there is currently no market for the preferred stock we hold 
therefore  we have used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these investments as of december  to date  we have determined that  for our auction rate securities and preferred stock  other than temporary impairment  or otti  has occurred and we intend to sell these investment securities prior to recovery and therefore  we have recorded otti charges as a reduction to earnings 
provision for income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes and the realizability of assets in future years 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of our communication ics 
we recognize revenue at the time the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for the products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
we provide incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time at which we ship product to the customers 
estimated incentive amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and are based on agreements between us and our customers 
estimating incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates may require revisions at later dates if the actual claims submitted by the customers differ significantly from the original estimates  which may have the effect of increasing or decreasing net revenue and gross profit as a percentage of revenue in a particular period 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related cost of goods sold on shipments to distributors that have rights of return or price protection privileges on unsold products until the products are sold by the distributor to its customers 
price protection rights grant distributors the right to a credit in the event of declines in the price of our products 
as of december   we did not conduct any business with customers that had arrangements providing them with rights of return  other than for normal warranty returns  or price protection that would have required deferral of revenues upon shipment 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  auction rate securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
we believe that the carrying amounts of the financial instruments approximate their respective fair values 
we regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis  the financial condition  credit quality and near term prospects of the investee  and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to any anticipated recovery in fair value 
when there is no readily available market data  we may make fair value estimates  which may not necessarily represent the amounts that could be realized in a current or future sale of these assets 
marketable securities 
we classify marketable securities as available for sale 
we view our available for sale portfolio as available for use in current operations 
accordingly  we have classified all investments with a readily available market as short term  even though the maturity dates may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date  because of the intent to sell these securities prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs or as part of a risk management program 
when we find that a readily available market does not currently exist for the securities  we classify these securities as long term due to the potential inability to sell the securities within one year of the current balance sheet date 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and we record temporary unrealized holding gains and losses as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we charge unrealized losses against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  the extent to which 
table of contents fair value is less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and  whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to any anticipated recovery in fair value 
realized gains and losses are accounted for on the specific identification method 
inventory valuation 
we continually assess the recoverability of our inventory based on assumptions about demand and market conditions 
forecasted demand is determined based on historical sales and expected future sales 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or its current estimated market value 
we reduce our inventory to the estimated lower of cost or market value to account for its obsolescence or lack of marketability 
reductions are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that may adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of current authoritative guidance using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective application method  compensation expense for stock based awards granted by us as a public company prior to  but not yet vested as of january   is recorded in accordance with the fair value based method 
for stock based awards granted before november  the date on which we filed our registration statement for our initial public offering  we recorded compensation expense using the intrinsic value based method 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after december  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of current authoritative guidance 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
at december  there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans  net of estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions used shown in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
for   and the first six months of  we based our expected term on the expected terms used by similar entities since we did not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted 
for the final six months of and the first six months of  we estimated the expected term based on our historical financial data and estimates of future option exercise activity  as well as the expected terms used by similar entities 
for the final six months of  we estimated expected term based on our historical financial data and estimates of future option exercise activity 
for stock options assumed as a result of the intellon acquisition in december  expected term was calculated using the simplified method because we did not have sufficient historical exercise data related to the intellon stock options to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term 
for options granted after december   we estimated volatility based on considerations of the implied volatility of long term options traded on the open market and the average historical volatilities of our stock and those of similar entities 
for the final six months of and all of  we estimated the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based entirely on considerations of the implied volatility of long term options traded on the open market and our average historical volatilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible accounts receivable and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our receivables are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make collection of our accounts receivable more difficult  require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and negatively affect our working capital 
product warranty provision 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our chipset suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of replacement chipsets  rework and inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing a chipset after failure 
we continuously monitor chipset returns for warranty and maintain an accrual for the related warranty expenses based on historical experience of similar products as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we adjust the warranty accrual rate based on these actual experiences and specific expected obligations 
when actual failure rates  cost of chipset replacement  rework and inbound and outbound freight costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual are made 
any such revisions may have the effect of increasing or decreasing gross profit both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue in a particular period in which these estimates are adjusted 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  projections of future income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of 
table of contents future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we would increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign countries  and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
however  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgment and estimates 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions and believe that our provision for uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties  is adequate based on information currently available to us 
the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
our provision for uncertain tax positions is attributable to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international tax operations 
our overall provision requirement could change due to the issuance of new regulations or new case law  negotiations with tax authorities  resolution with respect to individual audit issues  or the entire audit  or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we record goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we amortize acquisition related identified intangibles on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of three to five years for purchased technology  two to seven years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
we measure and test goodwill on an annual basis on october or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
for goodwill analysis  we operate under one reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit by taking the market capitalization of the reporting unit as determined through quoted market prices 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the reporting unit was not at risk of failing step one of the annual goodwill impairment test for the years ended december  and we only perform the second step of the process if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  impairment exists and is recorded 
we have not been required to perform this second step of the process because the fair value of the reporting unit has exceeded the net book value at every measurement date 
long lived assets 
we account for long lived assets  including other purchased finite lived intangible assets  in accordance with current authoritative guidance  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using quoted market prices or discounted expected future cash flows 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
our estimates regarding future anticipated net revenue and cash flows  the remaining economic life of the products and technologies  or both  may differ from those used to assess the recoverability of assets 
in that event  impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets may be required  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase to net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
to date  we have not recorded any impairment losses on our long lived assets 
litigation and settlement costs 
we are periodically involved in litigation and other legal proceedings 
we prosecute and defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation including any potential substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the determination of intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past infringement or to obtain a license under the opposing party s intellectual property rights and pay license fees and royalties  which could adversely impact our profitability in future periods  or prevent us from selling certain of our products or to cease in the development of a certain type of technology 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we would record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency if information available prior to issuance of financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
actual liabilities in any such disputes or litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs

table of contents we expect first quarter of revenue to increase compared with the fourth quarter of based on increased product demand in our networking channel and the impact of our acquisition of intellon corporation which closed in december  partially offset by decreases in our consumer channel  however  overall revenue and anticipated channel and product mix may differ from our current expectations 
gross profit years ended december  change in gross profit of net revenue gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased during the year ended december  compared with  primarily due to declining average selling prices  partially offset by a decline in product costs related to supply chain efficiencies

this increase was partially offset by cash paid in connection with our acquisition of intellon 
impairment of long term investments our long term investments consist primarily of auction rate securities and preferred stock 
in the year ended december  and  we determined that our auction rate securities and preferred stock were other than temporarily impaired and recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of certain of these auction rate securities and preferred stock 
the additional impairment charge in is due to the continued deterioration in the financial markets that has negatively impacted the liquidity and potential recovery rates for the auction rate securities and preferred stock we hold 
we intend to sell these securities 
see the discussion at liquidity and capital resources in part ii item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in part ii item a  as well as note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for more detailed information on our investments in auction rate securities and this impairment charge 
the estimated fair value of these securities could decrease or increase significantly in the future based on market conditions and we may be required to record additional losses for impairment if we determine there are further declines in fair value 
provision for income taxes years ended december  change in income tax benefit provision of net revenue the benefit for income taxes was million for the year ended december  as compared with the provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  these amounts represent approximately and of pre tax income for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents our effective tax rate includes a benefit of million related to the favorable settlement of a foreign tax liability resulting from a prior acquisition 
excluding this benefit  our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to profits earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the us tax rate and due to the benefit from federal and state research and development tax credits  partially offset by non deductible stock based compensation expense and non deductible acquisition related charges from the intellon acquisition 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to profits earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the us tax rate and due to the benefit from federal and state research and development tax credits  partially offset by income tax expense from non deductible stock based compensation expense and an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets

table of contents acquired in process research and development years ended december  change in acquired in process research and development of net revenue the acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  charges of million for related to the acquisitions of the remaining of the capital stock of attansic and u nav 
no ipr d charges were recognized in the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through estimates and valuation techniques based on the terms and details of each acquisition 
the amounts allocated to ipr d were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future use existed at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach as described above 
the ipr d charges include only the fair value of ipr d performed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the fair value of any developed technology is included in intangible assets and is amortized accordingly 
the amounts recorded as ipr d represent the estimated fair values and approximate amounts at which an independent third party would value these projects as of the respective acquisition dates 
at december   the single chip gps device project associated with our acquisition of u nav was completed  and actual results were materially consistent with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
at december   the ethernet controller and switch projects associated with our acquisition of attansic were complete  and actual results were materially consistent with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
as of december   the mobile communications ic projects associated with our acquisition of zydas were discontinued 
the discontinuation of the project did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the original assumptions consisted of expected completion dates for the ipr d projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projects for the products once they entered the market 
interest income  net years ended december  change in interest income  net of net revenue during the year ended december   interest income decreased compared to due primarily to significantly decreased yields on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this yield decline was partially offset by an increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  excluding auction rate securities  of million during the year ended december  compared to  resulting primarily from the generation of cash from operations  the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan 
this increase was partially offset by outlays for purchases of property and equipment 
impairment of long term investments our long term investments consist primarily of auction rate securities 
during and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of certain of these auction rate securities 
we have determined that the impairment charges are other than temporary in nature 
the additional impairment charge in is due to the continued deterioration in the financial markets that have negatively impacted the liquidity and potential recovery rates for the auction rate securities we hold 
see the discussion at liquidity and capital resources in part ii item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in part ii item a  as well as note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for more detailed information on our investments in auction rate securities and this impairment charge

table of contents the provision for income taxes was  for the year ended december  as compared to the provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december   which represents approximately and of pre tax income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to profits earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the us tax rate and due to the benefit from federal and state research and development tax credits  partially offset by income tax expense from non deductible stock based compensation expense and an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate for was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to foreign tax rate differences and by an income tax benefit of million related to the release of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which consisted of research and development tax credits

effective august   our line of credit agreement with a bank expired and was not renewed 
as of december   we had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling million to secure operating leases for equipment 
these standby letters of credit are secured by certificates of deposit 
long term investments consist primarily of auction rate securities representing our interest in insurance capital notes  issued by special purpose entities sponsored by insurance companies  such securities were rated aaa and aa at the date of purchase 
additionally  we acquired preferred stock issued by two monoline insurance companies that is currently illiquid  with an original par value of million  in the fourth quarter of  resulting from the forced conversion of two auction rate securities we held 
in december  we sold two of our auction rate securities with an original par value of million and a fair value of million for million 
as of december   we held auction rate securities and preferred stock with an aggregate par value of million and a fair value of million 
a portion of the auction rate securities are collateralized by tradable short term corporate and government notes  bonds and commercial paper 
since september  there have been no active markets for these auction rate securities and preferred stock 
we will not be able to liquidate any of our remaining auction rate securities or preferred stock until a buyer is found for these instruments or the securities are redeemed 
we expect to experience increases in our operating expenses in absolute dollars  in research  and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business strategy 
as a result  we anticipate that operating expenses as well as planned capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that research and development is essential to expanding our core technologies and product offerings 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these 
table of contents expenditures resulted in enhancement of our product offerings  technological know how and inventions that have yielded numerous issued and pending us patents 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses and intend to fund these expenses with operating cash flow  cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our products and potential future acquisitions

in december  we acquired intellon corporation for million consisting of million in cash and million in our common stock 
we may enter into arrangements in the future with respect to potential investments in  acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec regulations 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period less than year years after years total contractual obligations operating leases commitments under licensing agreements purchase of goods and services total we have excluded million in unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the periodic cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities

recent accounting pronouncements effective july   we adopted the fasb accounting standards codification  or the codification  as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
the codification superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification is non authoritative 
the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  it will issue accounting standards updates  or asus 
the fasb will not consider asus as authoritative in their own right 
asus will serve only to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on the change s in the codification 
references made to fasb guidance throughout this document have been updated for the codification 
effective january   we adopted the fasb s updated guidance related to business combinations 
the updated guidance establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the updated standard also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the updated standard also provides guidance for recognizing changes in an acquirer s existing income tax valuation allowances and tax 
table of contents uncertainty accruals that result from a business combination transaction as adjustments to income tax expense 
the updated guidance had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the year ended december  in august  we recognized a one time tax benefit of million upon favorable resolution of a foreign tax obligation relating to a prior acquisition 
under prior accounting standards  the amount would have been recorded as an adjustment of goodwill 
in december  we completed our acquisition of intellon 
under the updated guidance we expensed the transaction costs associated with the intellon acquisition  while under the prior accounting standards such costs would have been capitalized 
in addition  we acquired in process research and development of million which has been capitalized in accordance with the updated guidance  whereas under prior authoritative guidance the amount would have been expensed immediately 
therefore  the adoption of the updated guidance related to business combinations has had and likely will continue to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued updated guidance related to business combinations to address application issues regarding initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
in circumstances where the acquisition date fair value for a contingency cannot be determined during the measurement period and it is concluded that it is probable that an asset or liability exists as of the acquisition date and the amount can be reasonably estimated  a contingency is recognized as of the acquisition date based on the estimated amount 
this updated guidance is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations completed by us on or after january  adoption of this guidance did not have any material impact on our financial statements 
effective january   we adopted the fasb s updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures with respect to its financial assets and liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements 
the updated guidance provided a one year deferral of the effective date of the fair value guidance for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we adopted the provisions of the fair value guidance for non financial assets and non financial liabilities effective january   and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
effective april   we adopted the fasb s updated guidance related to investments and debt securities  which amends the other than temporary impairment  or otti  guidance in us gaap to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation of other than temporary impairments in the financial statements 
under prior authoritative guidance  if otti was determined to exist  we recognized an otti charge into earnings in an amount equal to the difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value as of the balance sheet date of the reporting period 
under the updated guidance  if otti has been incurred  and it is more likely than not that we will not sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  then the otti is separated into a the amount representing the credit loss and b the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  or aoci 
the total otti  which includes both credit and non credit losses  is presented gross in our statements of operations and is reduced by the non credit loss amount of the total otti that is recognized in aoci 
there was no initial effect of adoption on april  as we have the intent to sell the securities we had previously deemed as other than temporarily impaired 
effective april   we adopted the fasb s updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with the guidance related to fair value measurements when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased 
the updated standard also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
the adoption of the updated guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
effective april   we adopted the fasb s updated guidance on financial instruments  which amends prior authoritative guidance to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements and also amends prior guidance to require those disclosures in all interim financial statements 
the adoption of the updated guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
effective april   we adopted the fasb s updated guidance related to subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
adoption of the updated guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we have evaluated subsequent events through february   the date the financial statements were issued 
effective july   we adopted the fasb s updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures for the fair value measurement of liabilities 
the updated guidance provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using certain techniques 
the updated guidance also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a 
table of contents separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability 
the updated guidance also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
adoption of the updated guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in october  the fasb issued updated guidance related to revenue recognition in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and certain arrangements that include software elements 
the updated guidance requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
the amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method 
the updated guidance also removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance 
the updated guidance should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  or level  a reporting entity should disclose separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
the updated guidance also requires that an entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
the updated guidance is effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   our investments were primarily in money market funds  corporate notes  corporate bonds  commercial paper  us government securities and to a lesser extent  auction rate securities  preferred stock and other cost based investments 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
our long term investments primarily consist of auction rate securities and preferred stock  which have been classified as long term due to the lack of a liquid market for these securities 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we believe that a change in interest rates will not have a significant impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on our interest income 
long term investments consist primarily of auction rate securities representing our interest in insurance capital notes  issued by special purpose entities sponsored by insurance companies  such securities were rated aaa and aa at the date of purchase 
additionally  we acquired preferred stock issued by two monoline insurance companies that is currently illiquid  with an original par value of million  in the fourth quarter of  resulting from the forced conversion of two auction rate securities we held 
in december  we sold two of our auction rate securities with an original par value of million and a fair value of million for million 
as of december   we held auction rate securities and preferred stock with an aggregate par value of million and a fair value of million 
a portion of the auction rate securities are collateralized by tradable short term corporate and government notes  bonds and commercial paper 
since september  there have been no active markets for these auction rate securities and preferred stock 
we will not be able to liquidate any of our remaining auction rate securities or preferred stock until a buyer is found for these instruments or the securities are redeemed 
these auction rate securities generally continue to earn and receive interest at the maximum contractual rate which averaged of face value as of december  one of the preferred stocks ceased paying dividends in december as there is currently no market for the preferred stock and auction rate securities  we have used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the auction rate securities and the preferred stock 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include recovery rate in the event of a default  liquidity risk premium  probability of earning maximum interest rate to maturity  probability of passing an auction at some point in the future  probability of default  estimates for interest rates and timing of cash flows 
as of december   we have determined that  for our auction rate securities and preferred stock  otti has occurred and we intend to sell these investment securities prior to recovery 
in the years ended december   and  we recorded otti charges for these securities of million  million and million  respectively 
to date  all otti losses on our long term investments have been recorded in earnings 

table of contents the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands  except percentages that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  our variable rate securities consist of money market funds and auction rate securities 
maturing in three months or less maturing between three months and one year maturing greater than one year total fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate weighted average interest rate effective august   our line of credit agreement with a bank expired and was not renewed 
as of december   we had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling million to secure operating leases for equipment 
these standby letters of credit are secured by certificates of deposit 
currently  our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations for revenues and cost of goods sold is not material 
our sales agreements generally provide for pricing and payment in us dollars and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
similarly  the majority of our purchases related to cost of goods sold are denominated and paid in us dollars and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
the risk associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates is generally limited to our operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as over of our employees are located outside of the us increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more or less expensive  which could have an impact on our business 
future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our business 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  nor do we believe that we currently have material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk
