item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview graymark healthcare  inc is organized under the laws of the state of oklahoma and is a diversified medical holding company that operates in two operating segments sleep management solutions  also known as sms  and apothecaryrx 
our first operating segment  sms  is one of the largest providers of care management solutions to the sleep disorder market based on number of independent sleep care centers and hospital sleep diagnostic programs operated in the united states 
we provide a comprehensive diagnosis and care management solution for patients suffering from sleep disorders 
our second operating segment  apothecaryrx  operates independent retail pharmacy stores selling prescription drugs  non prescription drugs  and an assortment of general merchandise 
through sms  we provide diagnostic sleep testing services and care management solutions for people with chronic sleep disorders 
in addition  we sell equipment and related supplies and components used to treat sleep disorders 
our products and services are used primarily by patients with obstructive sleep apnea  or osa 
our sleep centers provide monitored sleep diagnostic testing services to determine sleep disorders in the patients being tested 
the majority of the sleep testing is to determine if a patient has osa 
a continuous positive airway pressure  or cpap  device is the american academy of sleep medicine s  or aasm  preferred method of treatment for obstructive sleep apnea 
our sleep diagnostic facilities also determine the correct pressure settings for patient treatment with positive airway pressure 
sms sells cpap devices and supplies to patients who have tested positive for sleep apnea and have had their positive airway pressure determined 
there are certain noncontrolling interest holders in the sms testing facilities  who are typically physicians in the geographical area being served by the diagnostic sleep testing facility 
through our apothecaryrx segment  we operate independent retail pharmacy stores selling prescription drugs and a small assortment of general merchandise  including diabetic merchandise  non prescription drugs  beauty products and cosmetics  seasonal merchandise  greeting cards and convenience foods 
we have historically grown our pharmacy business by acquiring financially successful independently owned retail pharmacies from long term owners that were approaching retirement 
our acquired pharmacies have successfully maintained market share due to their convenient proximity to healthcare providers and services  high customer service levels  longevity in the community  competitive pricing 
additionally  our independent pharmacies offer supportive services and products such as pharmaceutical compounding  durable medical equipment  and assisted and group living facilities 
our pharmacies are located in mid size  economically stable communities and we believe that a significant amount of the value of our pharmacies resides in retaining the historical pharmacy name and key staff relationships in the community 

table of contents acquisitions growth strategy we are currently growing our sms segment through strategic business acquisitions and have historically grown our apothecaryrx segment through acquisitions 
most recently  on august   sdc holdings  one of our subsidiaries operating in the sms segment  entered into an agreement with avastrausa  inc and avastra sleep centres limited abn to acquire of the equity of somnitech  inc and somnicare  inc collectively referred to as somni and avastra eastern sleep centers  inc eastern for cash and stock consideration totaling million

acquisition goodwill in connection with the acquisitions during  our sms operating segment recorded goodwill of  and intangible assets of  based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
the intangible assets of  recorded during consisted of customer relationships with indefinite lives of  customer relationships of  amortizable over to years  trademarks having a value of  amortizable over years  covenants not to compete of  amortizable over the period of the covenants not to compete  to years and payor contracts of  amortizable over years 
in our sms operating segment recorded goodwill of  and intangible assets of  consisting of covenants not to compete having a value of  amortizable over the period of the covenants not to compete  three years  customer lists of  amortizable over years and trademarks of  amortizable over years 
in connection with the acquisitions during  our apothecaryrx operating segment recorded goodwill of  and intangible assets of  consisting of covenants not to compete having a value of  amortizable over the period of the covenants not to compete  three to five years and customer lists of  amortizable over to years 
goodwill and other indefinite lived assets are not amortized  but are subject to impairment reviews annually  or more frequent if necessary 
we are required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related operating unit below its carrying amount 
these circumstances may include without limitation 
table of contents a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we must compare the fair value of the operating unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the operating unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the operating unit will be estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach that utilize comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the operating unit ie  pharmacy or sleep center laboratory exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of an operating unit to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the operating unit goodwill  the fair value of the operating unit will be allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that operating unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of an operating unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities will be the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss will be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed during and resulted in no impairment losses

we have requested a waiver from certain restrictive covenants from arvest bank  and while we believe that arvest bank will grant such waiver  there can be no guarantee

it is not likely that we will achieve compliance by june  and there is no assurance that arvest bank will waive the requirement 
financial commitments we do not have any material capital commitments during the next months  but we do have contractual commitments of approximately million for payments on our indebtedness and for operating lease payments 
although we have not entered into any definitive arrangements for obtaining additional capital resources  either through long term lending arrangements or equity offering  we continue to explore various capital resource alternatives to replace our long term bank indebtedness 
in january  we filed a registration statement for the offering of  shares of our common stock 
due to existing market conditions  we have not completed the offering 
we expect to go forward with the stock offering during the next days  however there can be no assurance that the offering will be successful or that we will raise any proceeds from the offering 
we have grown primarily through acquisitions principally financed with borrowed funds 
in the current credit environment  we anticipate that additional borrowing arrangements will not be available during to fund future acquisitions 
we intend to continue our acquisition growth strategy with our focus primarily on sleep center acquisitions 
furthermore  as this growth plan is pursued  we may be required to enhance  expand and improve our operating and financial systems to maintain pace with the increased complexity of the expanded operations and management responsibilities 
the implementation and success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of factors  including available capital resources and working capital requirements 
even if we succeed in acquiring established sleep centers as planned  those acquired facilities may not achieve the projected revenue or profitability levels comparable to those of currently owned centers in the time periods we estimate or at all 
moreover  our newly acquired sleep centers may adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our existing locations and other operations 
the failure of our growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition  and available capital resources 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  and future capital resources may not be available to us in an amount needed to pay our indebtedness as it become due  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we plan to make significant acquisitions of established sleep centers during trough requiring substantial capital resources 
in addition  we may need to refinance some or all of our current indebtedness at or before maturity 
at december   our bank indebtedness used to fund the acquisitions of our existing pharmacies and sleep centers was approximately million 
this indebtedness requires quarterly accrued interest payments at floating variable interest rates interest rate at december  and quarterly principal payments beginning in september the quarterly principal payments will be calculated on a seven year amortization based on the unpaid principal balance on june  at december   we had amounts due under seller financing notes and non compete agreements of million and million  respectively 
the notes and non compete agreements bear interest at fixed rates 
we are required to make varying periodic payments of principal and interest under the seller financing and non compete agreements 
at december   we had total liabilities of approximately million 
because of our lack of significant historical operations  there is no assurance that our operating results will provide sufficient funding to pay our liabilities on a timely basis 
there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our current indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
failure to generate or raise sufficient funds may require us to modify  delay or abandon some of our future business growth strategies or expenditure plans 
future commitments under contractual obligations by expected maturity date at december  are as follows years total short term debt long term debt operating leases 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k as of december  and critical accounting policies the application of the following accounting policies  which are important in presenting our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap 
revenue recognition sleep center services and product sales from our sms operating segment are recognized in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
revenues from some of our product sales are paid over a specified period  typically to months 
we recognize the revenue on these sales in the month the commitment is entered into 
a reserve for estimated returns in recorded in the same month as the sale 
at our newly acquired somni business units  we recognize the revenue on these sales as the monthly payments become due 
it is our intent to move to a unified revenue recognition practice for these transactions during some of our services are provided under management service agreements and revenue from those agreements is recognized in the period services are provided 
other than services provided under a management service agreement  insurance benefits are assigned to us and  accordingly  we bill on behalf of our customers 
we have established an allowance to account for contractual adjustments that result from differences between the amount billed and the expected realizable amount 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for contractual adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to our collection procedures 
revenues in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are reported net of such adjustments 
pharmacy product sales from our apothecaryrx operating segment are recorded at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
customer returns are immaterial and are recorded at the time merchandise is returned 
sales taxes are not included in revenue 
due to the nature of the healthcare industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time products or services are provided 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables 
unbilled accounts receivable represent charges for services delivered to customers for which invoices have not yet been generated by the billing system 
prior to the delivery of services or equipment and supplies to customers  we perform certain certification and approval procedures to ensure collection is reasonably assured and that unbilled accounts receivable is recorded at net amounts expected to be paid by customers and third party payors 
billing delays  ranging from several weeks to several months  can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and 
table of contents external sources  interim transactions occurring between cycle billing dates established for each customer within the billing system and new sleep centers awaiting assignment of new provider enrollment identification numbers 
in the event that a third party payor does not accept the claim for payment  the customer is ultimately responsible 
we perform analysis to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable on a quarterly basis 
specifically  we consider historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends and relevant business conditions 
because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that our estimates could change  which could have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows 
cost of sales and services cost of sales and services for our sms operating segment includes technician labor required to perform sleep diagnostics  disposable supplies used in providing sleep diagnostics  and the cost of sleep therapy products and related supplies 
cost of sales and services are recorded in the period the related service was provided or product was sold 
cost of sales for our apothecaryrx operating segment include the cost of pharmaceuticals and merchandise sold to customers and is recorded in the period the items are sold 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for contractual adjustments  rental returns and doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable is due from medicare  private insurance carriers and other third party payors  as well as from customers under co insurance and deductible provisions 
our allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts is primarily attributable to our sms operating segment 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process that involves submission of claims to multiple payors  each having its own claims requirements 
in some cases  the ultimate collection of accounts receivable subsequent to the service dates may not be known for several months 
we have established an allowance to account for contractual adjustments that result from differences between the amounts billed to customers and third party payors and the expected realizable amounts 
the percentage and amounts used to record the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections  contractual adjustments  and aging of accounts receivable 
during the three months ended december   we recognized certain control and reporting material weaknesses related to our accounts receivable 
in performing the fourth quarter evaluation of the net realizable value of accounts receivable  we discovered that our realizable accounts receivable and accordingly our revenues should have been recorded net of an additional  to more closely reflect collectability of accounts receivable and to net that amount against revenue 
in addition to contractual allowance adjustment of  we recorded an additional allowance for bad debts of approximately  due to changes in the factors used to estimate the ultimate contractual allowances incurred from third party insurance companies 
during the second quarter  we completed our remediation of the accounts receivable issue by enhancing the analytical procedures used to analyze and estimate the contractual allowances and bad debts incurred on our sms segment s revenue 
during that process  we identified new information related to the correlation of the ultimate collectability of an account and the aging of that account that enhanced the estimates used to calculate the allowance for contractual adjustments and bad debts in our sms segment 
the new information included the following the passage of time 
an additional six months of history was available to be observed and analyzed 
that history reflected that certain accounts that were deemed collectible during the fourth quarter review had not been collected 

table of contents increase in net accounts receivable 
accounts receivable in our sms segment  net of the allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts  increased approximately million from december  to june  this increase in net accounts receivable happened at a time when sleep diagnostic volumes and revenues were declining indicating that actual collection efforts were lagging behind the estimates used at december  increase in risk assessment 
the additional history and increase in net accounts receivable caused management to increase its risk assessment of new accounts receivable 
the effect of this new information was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and resulted in an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and an increase in operating expenses of million 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment reviews  or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment of goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill which consist primarily of customer relationships  customer files  covenants not to compete  trademarks and payor contracts are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the remaining lives range from three to fifteen years 
we evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other indefinite lived assets are not amortized  but are subject to impairment reviews annually  or more frequent if necessary 
we are required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related operating unit below its carrying amount 
these circumstances may include without limitation a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the operating unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the operating unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the operating unit will be estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach that utilize comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the operating unit ie  pharmacy or sleep center exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of an operating unit to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the operating unit goodwill  the fair value of the operating unit will be allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that operating unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of an operating unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities will be the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss will be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
management controls over financial reporting in our sms segment during the three months ended december   we recognized certain control and reporting material weaknesses related to our oversight of the financial reporting process in our sms segment 
material weaknesses included a combination of control deficiencies noted by us in relation to the audit adjustments proposed during the audit of our financial statements 
none of the adjustments or control deficiencies noted were deemed material on an individual basis  but we deemed the control deficiencies to be material in the aggregate 
the control deficiencies 
table of contents noted included the process to approve journal entries and the process to ensure that all accounts are reviewed and reconciled where appropriate 
we have remediated the control deficiencies by enhancing the review and approval controls over financial reporting including the approval of all significant journal entries and review and where appropriate reconciliation of all significant accounts 
recently adopted and recently issued accounting guidance adopted guidance on september   we adopted changes issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb to the authoritative hierarchy of gaap 
these changes establish the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants

these changes provide additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance for identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly

these changes require an acquirer in a business combination  including business combinations achieved in stages step acquisition  to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
this guidance also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from certain contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values

this guidance also states that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability and a quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements
