factors considered include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
additionally  the purchase price of the applicable property is allocated to the above or below market value of in place leases and the value of in place leases and related tenant relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of the acquired in place leases is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii the company s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease

the company estimates the fair value using available market information or other industry valuation techniques such as present value calculations

table of contents the topic and tests the carrying value for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
to estimate the fair value of its reporting units  the company used a discounted cash flow model and market comparable data 
significant judgment is required by management in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
these assumptions include cash flow projections utilizing revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  market economic conditions  etc 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered to not be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated a potential impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identified intangibles 
during the fourth quarter of  the company identified the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and the volatility of the company s market capitalization as goodwill impairment indicators 
the company s goodwill impairment analysis resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of approximately million during the year ended december  the company also analyzed its trade name for impairment pursuant to the requirements of the topic and determined that the trade name was not impaired as of december  and accordingly  no impairment charge was recorded related to the trade name during the years ended december  and in addition to testing goodwill and its trade name for impairment  the company tested the intangible contract rights for impairment during the fourth quarter of and the intangible contract rights represent the legal right to future disposition fees of a portfolio of real estate properties under contract 
as a result of the current economic environment  a portion of these disposition fees may not be recoverable 
based on the company s analysis for the current and projected property values  condition of the properties and status of mortgage loans payable  the company determined that there are certain properties for which receipt of disposition fees was improbable 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million and million related to the impaired intangible contract rights as of december  and  respectively

the company is also subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to commission disputes and environmental  labor and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters
