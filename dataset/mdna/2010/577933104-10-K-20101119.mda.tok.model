business overview we provide business process outsourcing services to government health and human services agencies under our mission of helping government serve the people 
our business is focused almost exclusively on administering government sponsored programs such as medicaid  the children s health insurance program chip  health care reform  welfare to work  medicare  child support enforcement and other government programs 
founded in  we are one of the largest pure play health and human services administrative providers to governments in the united states  australia  canada and the united kingdom 
we use our expertise  experience and advanced technological solutions to help government agencies run efficient  cost effective programs and to improve program accountability  while enhancing the quality of services provided to program beneficiaries 
during recent years  the company has made a number of changes to the business to eliminate unprofitable lines of business  focus on the company s core health and human services business  and put into place a risk management structure to enable focus on profitable growth 
these steps have included the expansion of the company s core business  both domestically and internationally  the divestiture of several non core businesses during and  and the exit from an unprofitable contract in  which resulted in a large legal and settlement expense in that year 
the growth in in the welfare to work business in australia and the united kingdom has increasingly made the company a global competitor 
we believe the growth in revenues and net income in these periods reflects the steps taken to improve the focus of this business 
during the fourth quarter  the company aligned its organization of the business to reflect its focus on the administration of government health and human services programs 
as a result of this organizational realignment  the company has reclassified its segment financial information to reflect the two new operating segments of health services and human services 
all historical results have been recast to reflect the organization in its current form

to provide this information  revenue from foreign operations is converted into united states dollars using average exchange rates from the previous fiscal year 
we also discuss organic growth revenue information to provide a framework for assessing how the business performed excluding the effect of business combinations 
to provide this information  revenue from recently acquired entities is removed from the current and prior years with no full year comparative revenues 
both constant currency and organic growth revenue information are non gaap numbers 
we believe that these numbers provide a useful basis for assessing the company s performance 
the presentation of these non gaap numbers is not meant to be considered in isolation  or as an alternative to revenue growth as a measure of performance 
revenue increased to million for the year ended september   compared with the prior year 
organic growth was responsible for of this growth 
on a constant currency basis  the revenue growth would have been 
the principal driver of growth was the human services segment

table of contents the principal driver of growth for the fiscal year was strong results in our health services segment 
the human services segment was adversely affected by the strong united states dollar  which was partially offset by the benefit of a full year of operations from the company s uk subsidiary  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expense sg a consists of costs related to general management  marketing and administration 
these costs include salaries  benefits  bid and proposal efforts  travel  recruiting  continuing education  employee training  non chargeable labor costs  facilities costs  printing  reproduction  communications  equipment depreciation  intangible amortization  and legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business 
in fiscal  sg a includes an additional charge of million related to the under estimation of stock option charges in and without this adjustment  sg a expenses in that year as a percentage of revenue would have been 
in  sg a included a bad debt charge of million related to a long term receivable balance 
without this charge  sg a as a percentage of revenue would have been 
sg a as a percentage of revenue has declined year on year for each of the last two years 
this is the result of improved efficiencies within the business 
operating income from continuing operations increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  from million to million 
the increase of million has been driven by growth in the business  the benefits of favorable exchange rates on foreign sourced income  and increasing economies of scale in operating the business 
operating income from continuing operations increased in fiscal  compared to fiscal  from million to million 
the increase of million is primarily attributable to a million legal and settlement recovery in compared with a charge of million in see the discussion of legal and settlement expense below for a breakdown of this balance 
in addition  fiscal benefited from a non recurring million gain on the sale of a property in mclean  virginia 
legal and settlement expense recovery  net for fiscal years  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
legal and settlement expense recovery consists of costs  net of reimbursed insurance claims  related to significant legal settlements and non routine legal matters  including future probable legal costs estimated to be incurred in connection with those matters 
legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
following a change in accounting standards  from october  the incremental costs of acquisitions  including legal fees  brokerage fees  and valuation reports  are included in this balance 
under previous accounting guidance  these expenses were included as part of the acquisition consideration of successful acquisitions 
the following table sets forth the matters that represent legal and settlement expense recovery  net year ended september  dollars in thousands acquisition expenses accenture arbitration  related settlement and insurance recoveries  net other total in december  maximus  accenture llp and the texas health and human services commission hhsc entered into an agreement settling all claims among the parties arising from a prime contract between accenture and hhsc for integrated eligibility services and a subcontract between maximus and accenture in support of the prime contract 
in connection with that settlement  maximus paid a total of million and agreed to provide services to hhsc valued at an additional million 
the company s primary insurance carrier paid million of the amount due from maximus at the time of the settlement 
in fiscal  the company recovered an additional million from one of its excess insurance carriers  and in fiscal the company recovered million from another excess insurance carrier 
the decrease in interest and other income between and is primarily attributable to declines in market rates 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company held a balance of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
during the first quarter  million was used as part of a share buyback  significantly reducing the cash balance and the consequent interest income 
at the current time  the company holds cash and cash equivalents in excess of million but is generating significantly lower returns on this balance due to the decline of market rates 
approximately half of the interest earned in relates to interest on the loan note related to the sale of unison maximus inc  discussed below under discontinued operations 

table of contents provisions for income taxes from continuing operations were   and in  and  respectively 
the principal reason for the decline in the tax rate reflects the increasing amount of profit being recorded in foreign jurisdictions where income tax rates are lower than those within the united states of america 
certain non recurring items  including adjustments to tax uncertainties and our operations in israel  were responsible for a decline of in the tax rate in health services segment year ended september  dollars in thousands revenue gross profit operating income operating margin percentage the health services segment provides a variety of business process outsourcing and administrative support services  as well as consulting services for state  provincial and federal programs  such as medicaid  chip  medicare  and the british columbia health insurance program 
in fiscal  revenue increased compared to fiscal driven by the acquisition of deltaware in  which accounted for of this growth  with the rest of the growth attributable to new work 
operating margin in was lower compared to fiscal  principally due to the timing on contract rebids and the expansion of lower risk  cost reimbursable programs  where margins are typically lower 
revenue increased to million in fiscal compared with fiscal  driven by new work 
operating margin in fiscal was slightly lower compared to fiscal  driven principally by the timing of contract rebids 
human services segment year ended september  dollars in thousands revenue gross profit operating income operating margin percentage the human services segment includes a variety of business process outsourcing  case management  job training  and support services for programs such as welfare to work programs  child support enforcement  k special education  and other specialized consulting services 
revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily driven by program expansion in australia which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal and new work in the united kingdom which commenced in the first quarter fiscal 
operating margin improvement in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven by margin improvement attributed to revenue growth in australia and the united kingdom  with the results tempered by cost growth on a fixed price education contract in the united states 
revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared to revenue growth in australia was offset by declines related to the company s wind down of its federal claiming business  which the company formally exited in fiscal the company had approximately million of acquired growth from the united kingdom business acquired in  offset by million of decline caused by foreign exchange

table of contents discontinued operations enterprise resource planning erp on september   the company sold its erp division for cash proceeds of million  net of transaction costs of million  and recognized a pre tax loss on sale of less than million 
the company previously recognized a pre tax loss on sale of million in fiscal in completing this sale  the company elected to retain a single contract that had previously been included within the erp division 
this contract had identifiable cash flows and requires maximus to provide services which are dissimilar to other projects within the erp division 
the retained contract has been transferred to another business division within the health services segment 
security solutions on april   the company sold its security solutions division for cash proceeds of million  net of transaction costs of million  and recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of million 
unison maximus  inc on may   the company sold unison maximus  inc for proceeds of million

the sale price of million consists of million in cash and million in the form of a promissory note secured by a security interest in all of the assets of the former subsidiary  a pledge of shares by the buyer  and a personal guaranty by members of the management team who are shareholders of the buyer 
the company has deferred recognition of a pre tax gain on the sale of million  and interest income on the promissory note  until realization is more fully assured 
the deferred gain and deferred interest of million and million is reflected as a deduction from the note receivable on the consolidated balance sheets as of september  and  respectively 
justice solutions  education systems and asset solutions on september   the company sold its justice solutions  education systems  and asset solutions divisions  which were previously reported as part of its systems segment 
at that time  the company recognized a pre tax loss of million  subject to adjustment for purchase price adjustments and estimated transaction costs

you should read this information in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 

table of contents our revenue and operating results are subject to significant variation from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contracts  the revenue earned on contracts  the timing of revenue on license sales  the timing of revenue on performance based contracts  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of government agencies for awarding contracts  and the term of each contract that we have been awarded 
because a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
further  we have occasionally experienced a pattern in our results of operations pursuant to which we incur greater operating expenses during the start up and early stages of significant contracts prior to receiving related revenue 
our quarterly results may fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at september  that require the company to make future cash payments in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands operating leases long term debt acquisition related contingent consideration deferred compensation plan liabilities total acquisition related contingent liabilities are based upon the achievement of profitability and sales targets 
the fair value was determined based on a probability weighted approach derived from management s estimates 
the timing and amount of these contingent payments are based upon our current assessment of the fair value of the liability 
see note acquisition 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the company s unrecognized income tax benefits at september   we are unable to reasonably estimate settlements with taxing authorities 
the above contractual obligations table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of approximately million  of which approximately million is related interest and penalties 
see note income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on income taxes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources current economic environment within the united states  the current economic environment facing state and local governments is extremely challenging 
not only are they experiencing declining tax revenues  but they are also facing increasing demand for critical services from the most vulnerable members of society 
at the same time  states are generally required to balance their budgets each year 
certain states may delay payments to vendors as a result of budgetary constraints 
in prior periods  the company has faced short term payment delays from state customers  all of which were ultimately recovered 
the company believes its liquidity and capital positions are adequate to weather short term payment delays 
in the event of more protracted delays  the company may be required to seek additional capital sources  amend payment terms or take other actions 
extended payment delays could adversely affect the company s cash flows  operations and profitability 
the federal government has passed economic stimulus legislation to address some of the pressures facing state and local governments 
the company believes that demand for its services in its core areas of health  education and human services will remain strong and that the economic stimulus package could ultimately increase demand for such services 
however  any increases in demand resulting from the economic stimulus legislation will depend largely upon the timing  amount and nature of the stimulus targeted at the states as well as the timing and nature of the states actions in response to such funding 
the situation for international governments is also challenging  with each of the areas in which maximus operates offering unique local issues in addition to general global economic factors 
both australia and the united kingdom have had recent changes in government leadership and both appear set to attempt austerity measures to deal with significant debt and commitments

the legal settlement was recorded as an expense in fiscal but not paid until fiscal cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in was million  a decline of million compared to fiscal  notwithstanding improved profitability in the decline was principally driven by the payments of million offset by recoveries of million related to the legal settlement with tx hhsc and accenture in december cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million in fiscal  compared with million in the increase of million is principally driven by million of acquisition payments related to deltaware and other acquisitions in  compared with million in  offset by declines in overall capital spending of approximately million following significant build out for contract expansions in australia and the united kingdom  as well as the completion of an enterprise resource planning system for internal use in  and million of cash received from the sale of the company s erp division in  compared with cash payments of million related to other disposals in cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million in fiscal  compared with cash provided by investing operations of million in fiscal the difference of million was primarily driven by the sale of million of marketable securities  representing the entire balance held by the company at the beginning of fiscal  million from the disposition of the company s systems businesses in  and million from the sale of a building in  offset by million of cash outflow from the purchase of a business in the united kingdom 
the balance of the difference is driven principally by an increase in acquisitions of capital assets as the result of contract expansions in australia and new work in the united kingdom  as well as the installation of an erp system for internal use in the united states 

table of contents cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
these cash flows were principally driven by repurchases of common stock  including a price adjustment under an accelerated share repurchase agreement in  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
details of the company s share repurchase activity are set forth in note shareholders equity 
the company also paid million  million and million in dividends in   and  respectively 
the beneficial effect of exchange rates of cash and cash equivalents of million in the current year reflects the weakening of the united states dollar and increases in our overseas cash balances  notably in australia 
to supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis  we use the non gaap measure of free cash flows from continuing operations to analyze the funds generated from operations 
we believe free cash flow from continuing operations is a useful basis for comparing our performance with our competitors 
the presentation of non gaap free cash flows from continuing operations is not meant to be considered in isolation  or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
we calculate free cash flow from continuing operations as follows year ended september  dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities continuing operations purchases of property and equipment capitalized software costs free cash flow from continuing operations repurchases of the company s common stock on november   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock under an accelerated share repurchase asr program 
under the asr agreement  the company acquired and retired  shares at an initial price of per share for million plus fees of approximately million 
the counter party purchased an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the nine month period ended august  pursuant to the asr agreement  at its completion the company s initial price under the asr agreement was adjusted down based on the volume weighted average price vwap of the company s stock during this period 
such adjustment could be settled in cash or stock at the company s discretion 
on july   the counter party completed the purchase of shares in the open market  and the company elected to receive the price adjustment of million in cash 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  this receipt of cash was recorded as a decrease to common stock in the full amount of million 
under a resolution adopted in july  the board of directors authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to an aggregate of million of the company s common stock 
the resolution also authorized the use of option exercise proceeds for the repurchase of the company s common stock 
in september  a further board resolution increased the authorized repurchases by an additional million 
total share purchases under these plans are summarized as follows in thousands year ended september  number of share acquired under asr agreement july and september resolutions total total cost of shares in thousands of dollars acquired under asr agreement price adjustment under asr agreement july and september resolutions total as of november   the company had repurchased an additional  shares at a cost of million during the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents credit arrangements on january   the company entered into a revolving credit agreement providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility  with suntrust bank as administrative agent  issuing bank and swingline lender  and a syndicate of other lenders the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a million revolving line of credit commitment  which may be used i for revolving loans  ii for swingline loans  subject to a sublimit of million  and iii to request the issuance of letters of credit on the company s behalf  subject to a sublimit of million 
the company may request an increase in the commitment under the credit facility  such that the aggregate commitments under the credit facility shall at no time exceed million 
the credit available under the credit facility may be used  among other purposes  to refinance the company s current indebtedness  to repurchase shares of the company s capital stock and to finance the ongoing working capital  capital expenditure  and general corporate needs of the company 
subject to applicable conditions  the company may elect interest rates on its revolving borrowings calculated by reference to i the prime lending rate as announced by suntrust bank or  if higher  the federal funds effective rate plus a base rate borrowing  or ii the reserve adjusted rate per annum equal to the offered rate for deposits in us dollars for a one  two  three or six month period in the london inter bank market a libor borrowing  and  in each case  plus an applicable margin that is determined by reference to the company s then current leverage ratio 
for swingline borrowings  the company will pay interest at the rate of interest for a one month libor borrowing  plus the applicable margin  or at a rate to be separately agreed upon by the company and the administrative agent 
at september   the company had issued three letters of credit under the credit facility totaling million 
a letter of credit for million may be called by a customer in the event that the company defaults under the terms of a contract 
the letter was renewed in march and expires in march two letters of credit totaling million have been issued in relation to the company s insurance policies 
these letters of credit expire in may and may be renewed annually thereafter 
at september   the company has capacity to borrow  subject to covenant constraints  of up to million under this agreement 
the credit facility matures on january   at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid and all outstanding letters of credit must be terminated or cash collateralized 
the credit facility  as amended by the company and its lender on december   provides for the payment of specified fees and expenses  including an up front fee and commitment and letter of credit fees  and contains customary financial and other covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the company was in compliance with all covenants in the amended credit facility as of september  the company s obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of the company s direct and indirect subsidiaries collectively  the guarantors and are secured by substantially all of maximus and the guarantors present and future tangible and intangible assets  including the capital stock of subsidiaries and other investment property 
in addition to this credit facility  the company has a loan agreement with the atlantic innovation fund of canada  which was acquired as part of the deltaware acquisition see note acquisition 
this provides for a loan of up to million canadian dollars  which must be used for specific technology based research and development 
the loan has no interest charge and is repayable in installments between and at september   million million canadian dollars was outstanding under this agreement 
the balance will be repayable in forty quarterly installments commencing from july   with the final payment no later than fiscal borrowings using this facility reduce the availability of credit under the revolving credit agreement 
other our working capital at september  and was million and million  respectively 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and debt of million 
management believes this liquidity and financial position  along with the revolving credit facility discussed above  provides sufficient liquidity to continue any contemplated stock repurchase program depending on the price of the company s common stock  to pursue selective acquisitions  and to consider the continuation of dividends on a quarterly basis 
restricted cash represents amounts collected on behalf of certain customers and its use is restricted to the purposes specified under our contracts with these customers 

table of contents under the provisions of certain long term contracts  we may incur certain reimbursable transition period costs 
during the transition period  these expenditures result in the use of our cash and in our entering into lease financing arrangements for a portion of the costs 
reimbursement of these costs may occur in the set up phase or over the contract operating period 
related revenue may also be deferred during the set up phase 
as of september   million in net costs had been incurred and reported as deferred contract costs on our consolidated balance sheet 
on october   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of for each share of the company s common stock outstanding 
the dividend will be paid on november  to shareholders of record on november  based on the number of shares outstanding  the payment will be approximately million 
we believe that we will have sufficient resources to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditure and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have material off balance sheet risk or exposure to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
effects of inflation as measured by revenue  approximately of our business is conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which adjust revenue to cover costs increased by inflation 
approximately of the business is time and material contracts where labor rates are often fixed for several years 
we generally have been able to price these contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
the remaining portions of our contracts are fixed price and performance based and are typically priced to account for the likely inflation from period to period to mitigate the risk of our business being adversely affected by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts  the realizability of goodwill  and amounts related to income taxes  certain accrued liabilities and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we do not have material off balance sheet risk or exposure to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
additionally  although on certain contracts we are bound by performance bond commitments and standby letters of credit  we have not had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds 
also  we do not speculate in derivative transactions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
in fiscal  approximately of our total revenue was derived from state and local government agencies  from foreign customers  from federal government agencies  and from other sources  such as commercial customers 
revenue is generated from contracts with various pricing arrangements  including fixed price  performance based criteria  costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost plus  and time and materials 
also  some contracts contain not to exceed provisions 
of the contracts with not to exceed provisions  to the extent we estimate we will exceed the contractual limits  we treat these contracts as fixed price 
for fiscal  revenue from performance based contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from cost plus contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from fixed price contracts was approximately of total revenue  and revenue from time and materials contracts was approximately of total revenue 
a majority of the contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed price and performance based  and our contracts with the federal government generally have been cost plus 
fixed price and performance based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts 

table of contents we recognize revenue on general service arrangements as work is performed and amounts are earned 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on fixed price contracts when earned  as services are provided 
for certain fixed price contracts  primarily systems design  development and implementation  we recognize revenue based on costs incurred using estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs to be incurred 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and costs is recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided for in full in the period in which such losses become known 
for other fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
where obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern  revenue is generally recognized as services are provided  based upon outputs provided to the customer 
with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of potential cost overruns 
costs related to contracts may be incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue 
these costs are generally expensed 
however  certain direct and incremental set up costs may be deferred until services are provided and revenue begins to be recognized  when such costs are recoverable from a contractual arrangement 
set up costs are costs related to activities that enable us to provide contractual services to a client 
the timing of expense recognition may result in irregular profit margins 
we recognize revenue on performance based contracts as such revenue becomes fixed or determinable  which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers 
for certain contracts  this may result in revenue being recognized in irregular increments 
revenue on cost plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate of the negotiated fee earned 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized based on hours worked and expenses incurred 
our most significant expense is cost of revenue  which consists primarily of project related costs such as employee salaries and benefits  subcontractors  computer equipment and travel expenses 
our management uses its judgment and experience to estimate cost of revenue expected on projects 
our management s ability to accurately predict personnel requirements  salaries and other costs as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our fixed price  performance based and time and materials contracts 
if actual costs are higher than our management s estimates  profitability may be adversely affected 
service cost variability has little impact on cost plus arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the customer 
we also license software under license agreements 
software license revenue is recognized when a customer enters into a non cancelable license agreement  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  there are no significant future performance obligations  the license fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the license fee is considered probable 
amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred and classified as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company determines the value of the software component of its multiple element arrangements using the residual method as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements such as the support and maintenance agreements and related implementation and training services  but not for all delivered elements such as the software itself 
the residual method requires revenue to be allocated to the undelivered elements based on the fair value of such elements  as indicated by vsoe 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
maintenance and post contract customer support revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements  which in most cases is one year 
revenue from software related consulting services under time and material contracts and for training is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from other software related contract services requiring significant modification or customization of software is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
where contracts have multiple deliverables  we evaluate these deliverables at the inception of each contract and as each item is delivered 
as part of this evaluation  we consider whether i a delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair market value of the undelivered items  and iii whether the delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control  if a general right of return exists 
where deliverables  or groups of deliverables  have all three of these characteristics  we treat each deliverable item as a separate unit of accounting and apply the relevant revenue recognition guidance to each deliverable 
for transactions entered into after september   the company will adopt updated accounting rules with respect to multiple element arrangements

table of contents impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is typically obtained by the company as a result of business combinations 
goodwill represents the difference between the consideration paid in acquiring the business and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including how we define reporting units and determine their fair value 
a reporting unit is the operating segment  or a business one level below that operating segment the component level if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed regularly by segment management 
however  components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics 
we recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we use discounted cash flows to establish fair values 
when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples to corroborate the discounted cash flow results 
when a portion of a reporting unit is disposed of  goodwill is allocated using the relative fair value method for purposes of calculating the gain or loss on disposal 
in addition  a goodwill impairment test is performed for the remaining portion of the reporting unit 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of july st of each year 
at july   the company performed the annual impairment test based upon the reporting units in existence at this time  which were consistent with the company s operating segments at this time  consulting and operations 
based upon this test  management determined that there had been no impairment of goodwill 
upon the reorganization of the business in the fourth quarter  goodwill balances were reallocated to the new reporting units and a further test for goodwill impairment was performed 
this also did not demonstrate any evidence of goodwill impairment 
changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill impairment assessment could affect the estimated future fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment in the future 
however  a decline in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at july  or september  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
acquisition related contingent consideration 
for all acquisitions occurring after october   the company is required to calculate the fair value of any contingent consideration included within the acquisition agreement 
subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration will be included as an expense or a benefit in the financial statements of the company 
the company reassesses the most likely value of the consideration payable at each reporting period  based upon the financial performance or sales performance of the acquired entities and adjusts the liability to reflect these revised estimates 
any differences from the company s expectations of future profitability  both beneficially and adverse  will have an effect on the acquisition related contingent consideration liability 
capitalized software development costs 
all of the software development costs included within continuing operations relate to software which is intended for the company s internal use 
direct costs of time and material incurred for the development of application software for internal use are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software  ranging from three to eight years 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
on a regular basis we re evaluate our client receivables  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
if our clients were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
deferred contract costs 
deferred contract costs consist of contractually recoverable direct set up costs relating to long term service contracts in progress 
these costs include direct and incremental costs incurred prior to the commencement of us providing service to enable us to provide the contracted services to our customer 
such costs are expensed over the period services are provided under the long term service contract 
we review deferred contract costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our review is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related customer project 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount  we recognize a non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to equal projected future discounted cash flows 
no impairment charges were recorded in the three years ending september contingencies 
from time to time  we are involved in legal proceedings  including contract and employment claims  in the ordinary course of business 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly 
the amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy 

table of contents legal and settlement expense recovery  net 
legal and settlement expense consists of costs  net of reimbursed insurance claims  related to significant legal settlements and non routine legal matters  including future probable legal costs estimated to be incurred in connection with those matters 
legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
income taxes 
to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  changes in the geographic mix of our business  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
we may also establish tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not fully succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts  such as the progress of a tax audit  new case law  or expiration of a statute of limitations 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when  based upon the technical merits  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposure to market risk related to the effect of changes in interest rates  commodity prices and other market risks with regard to instruments entered into for trading or for other purposes is immaterial 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations in the australian dollar  canadian dollar  british pound and israeli shekel 
during the year ended september   the company earned approximately of revenues and of operating income from foreign subsidiaries 
at september   approximately of the company s assets are held by foreign subsidiaries 
the company mitigates its foreign exchange risks through maintaining sufficient capital within its foreign subsidiaries to support the short term and long term capital requirements of these businesses 
the company s foreign subsidiaries typically incur costs in the same currency as they earn revenues  thus limiting the company s exposure to unexpected expenditures 
the operations of the us business do not depend upon cash flows from foreign subsidiaries
