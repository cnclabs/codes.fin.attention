table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts  stock compensation  taxes  inventory  contingencies and warranty reserves  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of the business or market conditions 
management judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
a portion of our revenue is derived from license agreements that entail the customization of faac s simulators to the customer s specific requirements 
revenues from initial license fees for such arrangements are recognized in accordance with fasb asc based on the percentage of completion method over the period from signing of the license through to customer acceptance  as such simulators require significant modification or customization that takes time to complete 
the percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement  which corresponds to the costs related to earned revenues 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
we believe that the use of the percentage of completion method is appropriate as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
in addition  contracts executed include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the parties to the contracts  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
in all cases we expect to perform our contractual obligations and our licensees are expected to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
the complexity of the estimation process and the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and specification and testing requirement changes 

table of contents we account for our other revenues from ies simulators in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
we assess whether collection is probable at the time of the transaction based on a number of factors  including the customer s past transaction history and credit worthiness 
if we determine that the collection of the fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and awards issued to employees in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of fasb asc using the modified prospective transition method 
under fasb asc  stock based awards to employees are required to be recognized as compensation expense  based on the calculated fair value on the date of grant 
we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected term  which affect the calculated values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
we reassess these allowances each accounting period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
if actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates  adjustments to these allowances may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters may be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income loss in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents we have provided a valuation allowance on the majority of our net deferred tax assets  which includes federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under fasb asc  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses in certain jurisdictions and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
we provide valuation allowances in respect of deferred tax assets resulting principally from the carryforward of tax losses 
management currently believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the carryforward of losses and certain accrued expenses will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
we do not provide for us federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are re invested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be re invested indefinitely 
we have indefinitely lived intangible assets consisting of trademarks  workforce  and goodwill 
these indefinitely lived intangible assets are not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
however  these assets are tax deductible  and therefore amortized over years for tax purposes 
as such  deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the tax deductibility of these indefinitely lived intangible assets 
the resulting deferred tax liability  which is expected to continue to increase over time  will have an indefinite life  resulting in what is referred to as a naked tax credit 
this deferred tax liability could remain on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment of the related assets for financial reporting purposes  or the business to which those assets relate were to be disposed of 
due to the fact that the aforementioned deferred tax liability could have an indefinite life  it is not netted against our deferred tax assets when determining the required valuation allowance 
doing so would result in the understatement of the valuation allowance and related deferred income tax expense 
on january   we adopted the provisions of the fasb asc fasb asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
we must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
once it is determined that a position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation 
if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate  the resulting adjustments could be material to its future financial results 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and may be subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 

table of contents inventories our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our revenue forecast  which is also used for our short term manufacturing plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write down if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
for fiscal  no significant changes were made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of inventory valuation or the methodology applied 
goodwill as of december   we had recorded goodwill of million 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests  and tests between annual tests in certain circumstances  based on estimated fair value  and written down when impaired 
we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis 
this type of analysis requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market multiples for the reportable units 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we may be required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in subsequent periods or if actual cash flows are below our estimates  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment review using the financial results as of the quarter ended june  although the cumulative book value of our reporting units exceeded our market value as of the impairment review  management nevertheless determined that the fair value of the respective reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values  and therefore  there would be no impairment charges relating to goodwill 
several factors contributed to this determination the long term horizon of the valuation process versus a short term valuation using current market conditions  
table of contents the valuation by individual business segments versus the market share value based on our company as a whole  and the fact that our stock is thinly traded and widely dispersed with minimal institutional ownership  and thus not followed by major market analysts  leading management to conclude that the market in our securities was not acting as an informationally efficient reflection of all known information regarding us 
in view of the above factors  management felt that in the current market our stock was undervalued  especially when compared to the estimated future cash flows of the underlying entities 
other intangible assets other intangible assets are amortized to the statement of operations over the period during which benefits are expected to accrue  currently estimated at two to ten years 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make assumptions regarding future business conditions and operating results in order to estimate future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record additional impairment charges 
contingencies we are from time to time involved in legal proceedings and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for any contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change due to future developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in the settlement strategy in dealing with any contingencies  which may result in higher net loss 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
warranty reserves upon shipment of products to our customers  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty 
our warranty period is typically twelve months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the reserve is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the warranty reserve is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality products and the fact that our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software 

table of contents functional currency we consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which we and our israeli subsidiary efl operate and  therefore  both we and efl have adopted and are using the united states dollar as our functional currency 
transactions and balances originally denominated in us dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income 
the majority of financial transactions of our israeli subsidiaries mdt and epsilor is in new israel shekels nis and a substantial portion of mdt s and epsilor s costs is incurred in nis 
management believes that the nis is the functional currency of mdt and epsilor 
accordingly  the financial statements of mdt and epsilor have been translated into us dollars 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statement of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
executive summary overview of results of operations we incurred net losses for the years ended december  and while we expect to continue to derive revenues from the sale of products that we manufacture and the services that we provide  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a consistent basis 
a portion of our operating loss during and arose as a result of non cash charges 
these charges were primarily related to our acquisitions  financings and issuances of restricted shares and options to employees 
to the extent that we continue certain of these activities during  we would expect to continue to incur such non cash charges in the future 
acquisitions in acquisition of subsidiaries  part of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition of subsidiaries is recorded based on the estimated expected life of the assets 
accordingly  for a period of time following an acquisition  we incur a non cash charge related to amortization of intangible assets in the amount of a fraction based on the useful life of the intangible assets of the amount recorded as intangible assets 
such amortization charges continued during we are required to review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that intangible asset has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
in the case of goodwill  the assets recorded as goodwill are not amortized  instead  we are required to perform an annual impairment review 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that goodwill has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we incurred non cash charges for amortization of definitive lived intangible assets in and in the amount of million and million  respectively 

table of contents financings and issuances of restricted shares  options and warrants the non cash charges that relate to our financings occurred in connection with our issuance of convertible securities with warrants  and in connection with our repricing of certain warrants and grants of new warrants 
when we issue convertible securities  we record a discount for a beneficial conversion feature that is amortized ratably over the life of the debenture 
during the third quarter of and pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement dated august   we issued and sold to a group of institutional investors senior convertible notes the notes in the aggregate principal amount of million due august  these notes are convertible at any time prior to august  at a conversion price of per share 
as part of our analysis of the convertible debt and related warrants  we reviewed and followed the guidance of fasb asc  asc  asc and asc the original accounting for the notes included the recording of a debt discount of  representing the relative fair value of the warrants issued with the convertible debt 
the relative fair value of the warrants was  and recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
the embedded conversion feature did not require bifurcation from the debt and did not result in any beneficial conversion value 
on january   we adopted fasb asc  determining whether an instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock 
fasb asc required us to re evaluate the warrants issued with the convertible notes and to also re evaluate the embedded conversion option and embedded put options within the notes to determine if the previous accounting for these items would change 
upon this re evaluation  we were required to record a cumulative adjustment as of january  that included reclassifying the warrant value previously included in stockholders equity  to other liabilities  reflecting the value of the embedded conversion feature as additional debt discount and as other liabilities as of the debt issuance date  increasing financial expenses due to the larger debt discount and increasing financial expenses to reflect the change in the value of the warrants and the conversion features from the debt issuance date to december  the aggregate additional expense of  was recorded as an adjustment to beginning accumulated deficit as of january  the embedded put options are now classified as derivative liabilities 
we again used the black scholes and other valuation techniques to determine the value of the warrants  the embedded conversion feature and the embedded put options associated with the notes as of january  on december   we again revalued these securities 
the year to date financial expense associated with this revaluation is approximately  the table below lists the variables used in the black scholes calculation and the resulting values

in the third quarter of  we wrote down the value of the dei note by  to million 
see also recent developments  below 
interest on the outstanding principal amount of the dei note commenced accruing on the issuance date and is payable quarterly  in arrears 
the issuer has been paying interest as required under the terms of the dei note  but did not pay the principal amount when due 
we have discontinued accruing interest on the dei note due to the provision on the dei note recorded this quarter 
interest on the dei note will be recognized as a reduction of financial expenses and will be shown on a cash basis 
related fees and costs will be recorded as general and administrative expense 
during and  we issued restricted shares to certain of our employees and to our directors 
these shares were issued as stock bonuses or were the required annual grant to directors  and are restricted for a period of up to three years from the date of issuance 
relevant accounting rules provide that the aggregate amount of the difference between the purchase price of the restricted shares in this case  generally zero and the market price of the shares on the date of grant is taken as a general and administrative expense  amortized over the period of the restriction 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rules  we incurred non cash charges related to stock based compensation in and in the amount of  and million  respectively 
overview of operating performance and backlog overall  our net loss before earnings from an affiliated company and tax expenses for was million on revenues of million  compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million during as of december   our overall backlog totaled million

in our battery and power systems division  revenues increased from approximately million in to approximately million in as of december   our backlog for our battery and power systems division totaled million 
common stock repurchase program in february of  we authorized  for a period of one year  the repurchase in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions of up to million of our common stock 
pursuant to this plan  through december  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for   net of commissions  all of which was purchased after april  shares repurchased are carried on our books as treasury stock 
at december   we had remaining authorization for the repurchase of up to  in shares of our common stock 
the repurchase program is subject to the discretion of our management 
recent developments dei note in the third quarter of dei repaid a portion of their internal shareholder loans  which was a violation of the dei note covenants with us 
because of this  we agreed in october of to amend the dei note to provide that the interest rate on the dei note would be increased to and would be payable through the payment date 
in the event that the dei note is not paid in full at maturity  the dei note will be convertible into a minimum of of dei s then outstanding common stock  or more under certain circumstances 
in november of dei brought in a new investor that was prepared to provide dei with additional working capital  but only if we agreed to step aside and accept a  discount on the dei note and waive our associated rights of first refusal and conversion 
in view of the possibility that dei would seek an extension of the dei note  we decided to enable dei to bring in the new investor and thereby be able to pay the dei note on time  albeit at a discount 
we accordingly wrote down the value of the dei note by  to million and charged the associated expense to other income expense on the statement of operations 
inasmuch as the new investor s investment did not close  we retain all our rights under the dei note  including our right to be paid the full amount of the dei note and its conversion option and right of first refusal 
we declared a default on the dei note when it was not paid pursuant to its terms at the end of december we are presently prohibited from bringing suit to collect this note pursuant to the terms of a subordination agreement with dei s senior lender 
however  we are maintaining communication with dei  and we continue to believe that dei s anticipated earnings and cash flow will enable the dei note to be paid  albeit late 
interest on the dei note has been paid by dei through november  and we expect dei to continue to make timely interest payments on the dei note

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and million in restricted cash  as compared to at december   when we had million in cash   in restricted cash and  in available for sale marketable securities 
our balance sheet cash position was impacted at year end due to million in expenditures for the purchase of inventory and materials relating to our capost contract in our faac subsidiary 
we also had million available in unused bank lines of credit with our main bank without considering the limitations of the borrowing base calculations and letters of credit  under a million credit facility under our faac subsidiary  which is secured by our assets and the assets of our other subsidiaries and guaranteed by us

this increase in cash provided was primarily the result of changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities for and was million and million  respectively  an increase of  this change was primarily the result of the increase in restricted cash and additions to capitalized software in  versus the acquisition activities  convertible loan purchased and the escrow settlement that took place in net cash provided by used in financing activities for and was million and million  respectively  a decrease of million  primarily due to the million note issued in as of december   we had approximately million in bank debt and million in long term debt outstanding 
subject to all of the reservations regarding forward looking statements set forth above  we believe that our present cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations and lines of credit should be sufficient to satisfy our current estimated cash requirements through the remainder of the year 
in this connection  we note that from time to time our working capital needs are partially dependent on our subsidiaries lines of credit 
over the long term  we will need to be profitable  at least on a cash flow basis  and maintain that profitability in order to avoid future capital requirements 
additionally  we would need to raise additional capital in order to fund any future acquisitions 

table of contents effective corporate tax rate we and certain of our subsidiaries incurred net operating losses during the years ended december  and  and accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
with respect to some of our us subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during  we were able to offset federal taxes against our net operating loss carryforward  which amounted to approximately million as of december  these subsidiaries are  however  subject to state taxes that cannot be offset against our net operating loss carryforward 
with respect to certain of our israeli subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during  we were unable to offset their taxes against our net operating loss carryforward  and we are therefore exposed to israeli taxes  at a rate of up to in less  in the case of companies that have approved enterprise status as discussed in note b 
to the notes to financial statements 
we also set up a tax liability for the impact of the deductions taken for goodwill 
as of december   we had a us net operating loss carryforward of approximately million that is available to offset future taxable income under certain circumstances  expiring primarily from through  and foreign net operating and capital loss carryforwards of approximately million  which are available indefinitely to offset future taxable income under certain circumstances
