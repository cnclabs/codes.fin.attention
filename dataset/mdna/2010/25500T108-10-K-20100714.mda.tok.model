item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding these statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
see item a risk factors for factors that could cause future results to differ materially 
overview we design  develop and market telecommunications equipment for use in enhancing voice quality and canceling echo in voice calls over wireline  wireless and internet protocol ip telecommunications networks 
our products monitor and enhance voice quality and provide transcoding in the delivery of voice services 
since entering the voice processing market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation products to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
our tdm based product introductions have leveraged the processing capacity of our newer hardware platforms to offer not only echo cancellation but also enhanced voice quality assurance vqa features including noise reduction  acoustic echo cancellation  voice level control and noise compensation through enhanced voice intelligibility 
we have also introduced products to support carriers that are deploying voice over internet protocol  or voip  technologies which offer all the voice capabilities of our tdm based products along with codec transcoding to meet the new challenges faced by carriers deploying voip technologies 
in fiscal  we announced development efforts on our new toktok and mstage products  which further leverage off our expertise in voice technology enabling on demand  voice driven  mid call accessible applications and services to be delivered to customers on wireless and wireline voice networks 
this offering is being designed to enable phone subscribers to use their voice as well as their thumbs to interact with web applications services like social networking and instant messaging im on demand  even on the fly during a telephone call 
in an effort supplement our toktok offering  we entered into an exclusive worldwide distribution agreement with simulscribe  under which we received the exclusive right to provide simulscribe s voice to text transcription services to customers world wide 
since becoming a public company in june  our financial success has been primarily predicated on the macroeconomic environment of us wireline and  more recently  wireless carriers as well as our success in selling to the larger carriers 
over the years since becoming public  we have experienced ebbs and flows in the level of demand from these carriers due to their level of network expansion  adoption of new technologies in their networks and the impacts of merger and other consolidation in the industry 
of late  the downturn in business volume we have experienced seems to have been driven by three main factors technology transitions  budgetary constraints  and the global economic crisis 
the technology transition has impacted us on two fronts 
first and foremost  carriers have been extremely cautious to invest in legacy second generation g technology  historically our primary source of revenue  for fear of stranding some or all of their investments by moving to newer third fourth generation technology g g 
the hesitancy to invest in g equipment has resulted in protracted purchase cycles and smaller deployments to mitigate perceived risks  while still addressing needed improvements in voice quality in g networks 
the second impact has been felt on the g g investment  which has been far slower to develop than was first predicted by industry experts 
instead 
table of contents of wholesale deployment of voip technologies  we have experienced a much more cautious entrance into this technology by many of the carriers with which we have historically done business  with the key by product being that they are buying much smaller systems than would have been expected from their historical buying pattern and in some cases even deciding to limit investment in g technology in lieu of even newer fourth generation technologies that are currently in development 
on the budgetary side  even before the world wide financial crisis became clear  we began to see tighter budgetary spending on capital equipment in many regions of the world  but most importantly with our large domestic customers 
spending on capital equipment appears to have been primarily targeted at equipment that could show a direct correlation with revenue generation as opposed to our historical product offerings  which although not a direct source of revenue for carriers is critical to the overall call experience and therefore to customer satisfaction  which in our opinion can ultimately translate into call revenue 
it is with this capital spending model in mind that we undertook development of our toktok and mstage products which  although leveraging off of our core knowledge of voice technology  we believe will be our first product offering to truly be tied to an identifiable revenue stream for our carriers 
lastly  we believe that the current market conditions around the world have and could continue to create further delays in purchasing decisions both as carriers tighten their capital investment activity due to internal budget constraints and as tighter credit hampers their ability to borrow to facilitate network expansion and or upgrades 
despite the previously mentioned delays due to budget and uncertainty around network architecture  we continue to believe that in the united states our continued focus on voice quality in the competitive wireless services landscape and the continued expansion of wireless networks  primarily using g g technologies and to a lesser degree g technologies  will be key factors in adding new customers and driving opportunities for revenue growth 
we continue to believe that g technology will be the dominant technology in the international regions of the world where we have focused our sales efforts 
however  we are poised to support the deployment of our packet voice processor pvp product in g g networks internationally  should demand for the g g technology grow internationally 
the development of our vqa feature set  which was originally targeted at the international global system for mobile communications gsm market  has seen growing importance in the domestic market as well 
we continue to focus sales and marketing efforts on international and domestic mobile carriers that might best apply our vqa solution 
we have continued to invest in customer trials domestically and internationally in an attempt to better avail ourselves of these opportunities as they arise 
despite these efforts  we have experienced mixed results as we remain dependant on the buying patterns of a small  yet more diverse  group of carriers 
we expect long term opportunities for growth will occur in voip based network deployments as there appears to be a growing  albeit slow  trend of service providers transitioning from traditional circuit switched network infrastructure to voip 
as such  between fiscal and early fiscal we directed the majority of our research and development spending towards the development of our pvp  a platform targeting voip based network deployments 
the packet voice processor introduces cost effective voice format transcoding capabilities combined with our vqa technology to improve call quality and clarity by eliminating acoustic echo and voice level imbalances and reducing packet loss and jitter 
although fiscal marked the first period in which revenue from the pvp exceeded of total revenue and the first quarter of fiscal marked the first quarter in which revenue from the pvp exceeded of total revenue  ordering patterns are still volatile leading to spikes in the timing and amount of revenue from this product 
beginning in fiscal  we began shifting our development efforts to other product offerings that leverage off our expertise in voice technology 
the first effort was tied to the creation of licensed versions of our core technology for use in other elements within communications networks  such as 
table of contents bluetooth headsets 
more recently we have shifted the majority of our development efforts to our mstage and toktok products  which are nearing the end of their initial development efforts and beginning to be deployed for evaluation at potential customer locations 
while the licensing initiative is typically focused on moving our expertise in voice quality to communication interface devices  mstage and toktok are designed to enable mobile subscribers to use their voice as well as their thumbs to interact with web applications like social networking and im on demand  even during a phone call 
in fiscal  we entered into an exclusive worldwide distribution agreement with simulscribe 
in conjunction with this agreement we obtained the exclusive right to market simulscribe s voice to text transcription services to customers around the world 
we believe that this voice to text transcription service provides a meaningful complement to the other voice technologies being developed under our mstage and toktok product initiatives 
we are undertaking these new opportunities in an effort to not only diversify our product offerings but also our customer base 
we believe that these products could help generate a more predictable revenue base  which we believe is less susceptible to our customer s decisions on the timing and nature of the network expansions than our legacy product offerings have experienced on a stand alone basis 
due to softened demand for our products over the last three years  we have undertaken a number of cost cutting measures in an attempt to better align our spending with our revenue levels while still investing in the future of the company by means of development projects  like our voice services products which leverage our core strengths in the voice technology and will hopefully provide for more stable revenue streams in the future 
the focus of our cost cutting efforts has not only been on reducing headcount  which has declined by well over since the end of fiscal  but also on targeted spending reductions on discretionary spending areas such as travel  marketing campaigns and trade shows 
we intend to continue to monitor our spending and intend to take further steps if needed to balance our spending with the revenue opportunities we see ahead of us 
acquisition history 
although we regularly evaluate whether there are acquisition candidates that have technologies that would compliment our products and core strengths  in the last five fiscal years  we have completed only two acquisitions 
in june  we acquired jasomi  which developed and sold session border controllers that enable voip calls to traverse the network address translation  or nat  and protect networks from external attacks by admitting only authorized sessions  ensuring that reliable voip service can be provided to them 
consideration for the acquisition totaled approximately million 
we additionally issued shares of ditech restricted stock to new employees hired as part of the acquisition 
in february  we completed a small acquisition of a company with infrastructure to deliver services with simple credit card billing through the web  with the name grid 
com 
this technology has been used to launch www 
phonetag 
com api  where the phonetag products are hosted with frictionless interfaces  allowing clients to sign up to phonetag without the necessity of signing special nda s or licensing agreements 
we intend to use the same infrastructure to launch software versions of vqa  and possibly other services that fit the same framework 
the website grid 
com is intended to be the landing site for these services once both phonetag and vqa are fully integrated 
the website www 
ditechnetworks 
com will remain the site for large carrier platform products 
the cost of the transaction  net of the cash we received  was approximately  reseller agreement 
in september  we entered into a reseller agreement with simulscribe pursuant to which we became the exclusive reseller of simulscribe s voice to text services to wholesale customers 
pursuant to the agreement  we also assumed all of simulscribe s wholesale customers 
we a paid million and issued a two year promissory note for an additional million for the assumption of the wholesale customer contracts and the exclusivity rights  b will pay a fee for the services provided by simulscribe  and c will pay up to an additional million if the revenues generated from the simulscribe services meet certain performance milestones within the first three 
table of contents years of the agreement the additional payments  subject to acceleration in certain events  such as our failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to market the services or a change of control of our company at a time that revenues from these services are on track to result in the payment ultimately being made 
the note and the additional payments are convertible into our common stock at simulscribe s option 
the note is convertible into our common stock at maturity in two years at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends and the like 
the additional payments may be converted into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  provided that if a specified revenue target is met then up to million of the additional payments can be converted at per share 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we amended our agreement with simulscribe that extended our exclusive distribution rights to all customers  not just wholesale customers 
the agreement  and the related amendment  were accounted for as an asset acquisition and the value of the consideration given was allocated to the assets received as part of the transaction 
our customer base 
historically  with the exception of fiscal  the majority of our sales have been to customers in the united states 
domestic customers accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal and and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
although we had begun to see our domestic revenue base decline as a percent of total revenue in fiscal and  due in large part to the growing interest in our vqa technology in several key international markets  fiscal returned to more consistent domestic sales levels with our historical experience as we saw increased domestic activity in both our legacy tdm business as well as our voip business  along with a decline in purchasing activity in the middle east and parts of south east asia 
however  sales to some of our us customers may result in our products purchased by these customers eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of any original equipment manufacturer that distributes overseas 
to date  the vast majority of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
our international revenue has been largely driven by demand from customers in south east asia  the middle east and latin america 
we expect our international demand to continue to be heavily influenced by these markets as they are experiencing the highest level of growth and commonly have the most need for cost effective solutions to address voice quality in their growing networks 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our largest customer in fiscal accounted for approximately of our revenue  and was a different customer than our largest customer for the last several years  which represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively  and of revenue in fiscal our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal and and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
consequently  the loss of any one of our largest customers  without an offsetting increase in revenue from existing or new customers  would have a negative and substantial effect on our business 
this customer concentration risk was evidenced in fiscal and again over the last few fiscal years as sudden delays and or declines in purchases by our large customers resulted in significant declines in our overall revenues and ultimately resulted in net losses for those periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our revenue recognition  investments  inventory valuation allowances  cost of warranty  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for stock based compensation and accounting for income taxes 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
if and when adjustments are required to reflect material differences arising between our 
table of contents ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in applying our revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies the level of judgment is generally relatively limited  as the vast majority of our revenue has been generated by a handful of relatively long standing customer relationships 
these customers are some of the largest wire line and wireless carriers in the world and our relationships with them are documented in contracts  which clearly highlight potential revenue recognition issues  such as passage of title and risk of loss 
as of april   we had deferred million of revenue 
however  only to the extent that we have received cash for a given deferred revenue transaction is the deferred revenue recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
of the million of total deferred revenue transactions at april   substantially all of it had been collected from customers and therefore million was reported as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
of the million of revenue deferred as of april   substantially all of it was associated with maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically twelve months 
in dealing with the remaining smaller customers  we closely evaluate the credit risk of these customers 
in those cases where credit risk is deemed to be high  we either mitigate the risk by having the customer post a letter of credit  which we can draw against on a specified date  to effectively provide reasonable assurance of collection  or we defer the revenue until customer payment is received 
investments we consider investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but remaining maturities of less than one year  and auction rate securities  which we have historically settled on  or day auction cycles  as short term investments 
however  when auction rate securities fail to settle at auction  which has been occurring since the middle of fiscal  and conditions leading to their failure to auction create uncertainty as to whether they will settle in the near term  we classify them as long term consistent with the contractual term of the underlying security 
long term investment securities include any investments with remaining maturities of one year or more and auction rate securities for which we are unable to estimate when they will settle 
short term and long term investments consist primarily of certificates of deposit  corporate notes and asset backed securities 
we have classified our investments as available for sale securities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we carry available for sale securities at fair value  and report unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities  if any  are included in other income  net based on specific identification 
we include interest on securities classified as available for sale in total other income 
see also the discussion in liquidity and capital resources and item a for additional information on auction rate securities 
inventory valuation allowances in conjunction with our ongoing analysis of inventory valuation  we constantly monitor projected demand on a product by product basis 
based on these projections we evaluate the levels of write downs required for inventory on hand and inventory on order from our contract manufacturers 
although we believe we have been reasonably successful in identifying write downs in a timely manner  sudden changes in buying patterns from our customers  either due to a shift in product interest and or a complete pull back from their expected order levels has resulted in the recognition of larger than anticipated write downs 
for example  we recorded inventory write downs for excess levels of inventory  due to wholesale shifts in demand  of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
there were no sales of previously written down inventory during fiscal  or cost of warranty at the time that we recognize revenue  we accrue for the estimated costs of the warranty we offer on our products 
we currently offer warranties on the hardware elements of our products ranging from one to five years and warranties on the software elements of our products 
table of contents ranging from days to one year 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product and provide software bug fixes within the term of the warranty 
our accrual for the estimated warranty is based on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we may revise our estimated warranty accrual to reflect these additional exposures 
this would result in a decrease in gross profits 
as of april   we had million accrued related to estimated future warranty costs 
see note of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances arise  we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carry amount of the assets in question  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our amortizable purchased intangible assets based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition 
the asset group represents the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during fiscal and  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million and million  respectively  associated with certain identifiable assets that were abandoned as a result of the cumulative affects of the reductions in force that had been implemented over the last two fiscal years 
accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period 
given our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options and  because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in our opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although we determine the fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer and a willing seller in a market transaction 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected option life and volatility 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model or the estimated forfeiture rate changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
accounting for income taxes amounts recorded for income taxes  both current and deferred  are based on estimates of the tax consequences of our operations in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
our deferred taxes are the result of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as valuation allowances for bad debts and inventory  for tax and accounting purposes 
as part of our ongoing assessment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  on a quarterly basis we review the expiration dates of our net operating loss and research credit carry forwards 
in addition  we complete a study on the impact of section of the internal revenue code on at least a semi annual basis to determine whether a change in ownership may limit the value of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we determined that a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets beginning as of april  was required 
we have considered all evidence  positive and negative  and believe that based on our recent operating losses and uncertainty about the 
table of contents magnitude and timing of future operating profits  it is no longer more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
effective may   we adopted the accounting guidance relative to accounting for uncertainties in income 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this guidance also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we have classified interest and penalties as a component of tax expense 
as a result of the implementation of this guidance effective may   we recognized a million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a decrease in the may  balance of accumulated deficit 
we do not expect a significant change to the liability for uncertain tax positions over the next months 
we are currently not under audit for any years or in any jurisdictions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these types of examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
recent accounting guidance adopted in the current fiscal year in september  an update was made to fair value measurements and disclosures investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent 
this update permits entities to measure the fair value of certain investments  including those with fair values that are not readily determinable  on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment or its equivalent if such net asset value is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles in financial services investment companies as of the reporting entity s measurement date measurement of all or substantially all of the underlying investments of the investee in accordance with the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance 
the update also requires enhanced disclosures about the nature and risks of investments within its scope that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
this update was effective for us beginning november  and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance for the fair value measurement of liabilities 
the guidance is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb amended the accounting standards for fair value measurement and disclosures 
the amended guidance requires disclosures regarding the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers 
it also requires separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level fair value measurements 
we began applying the guidance beginning february  the adoption of the guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or related footnotes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc  the authoritative guidance for gaap 
the codification is the single source of us gaap used by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements  except for rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws  which are sources of authoritative accounting guidance for sec registrants 
the codification is meant to simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by reorganizing us gaap pronouncements into roughly accounting topics within a consistent structure  its purpose is not to create new accounting and reporting guidance 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting 
table of contents standards and was effective for us beginning august  and we have incorporated the current codification in this form k 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead  it will issue accounting standards updates 
the fasb will not consider accounting standards updates as authoritative in their own right  these updates will serve only to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance  and provide the bases for conclusions on the change s in the codification 
effective the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the revised accounting guidance for the fair value measurement and disclosure of its nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
see note in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for business combinations  which established principles and requirements for the acquirer of a business to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets including in process research and development and defensive assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe this guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the may  effective date 
the application of this standard to the grid acquisition did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
recent accounting guidance not yet effective in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for the company beginning may   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we are currently assessing the potential effect  if any  on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for our financial statements beginning may  the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures for variable interests 
we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated results of operations years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangibles total operating expenses operating loss total other income expense  net loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss discussion of fiscal years ended april    and revenue years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands revenue change the increase in revenue in fiscal from fiscal was largely due to an increase in domestic deployments of both our bvp flex and our pvp systems  as well as initial sales attributable to our voice services products  primarily transcription services 
these increases were partially offset by declines in our international business primarily from customers in south east asia and the middle east  as changes in customer management and the shift in capital spending focus away from call quality to other aspects of their networks resulted in reduced deployments of product in these regions 
in the aggregate  our top five customers in fiscal accounted for million of our total revenue as compared to the top five customers in fiscal  which accounted for million 
the increase in revenue from our largest customer in fiscal  at t  a provider of domestic wireline  wireless and conferencing communications services  which accounted for of revenue in fiscal versus of revenue in fiscal  was largely due to targeted upgrades of portions of their g networks  as well as upgrades to portions of their voip conferencing network 
partially offsetting this increase  we experienced a decrease in revenue from verizon  our second largest customer in fiscal  both in real terms and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
this decline was driven 
table of contents by the declines in service contract revenue from verizon  as it reduced the level of maintenance services for its installed base of equipment 
this decline in maintenance revenue was only partially offset by increased deployment activity of new systems in fiscal we had one other customer that accounted for over of revenue in fiscal  a voip conferencing provider  which accounted for approximately of revenue in fiscal as compared to approximately of revenue in fiscal the decrease in revenue in fiscal from fiscal was largely due to a decrease in revenue from our largest domestic customer  verizon  as well as declines in overall purchases from the next four largest customers in fiscal  without an increase in other domestic and international business to offset these declines 
in the aggregate  our top five customers in fiscal accounted for million of revenue in fiscal as opposed to the top five customers in fiscal  which accounted for million 
our largest customer in fiscal and  verizon accounted for approximately million and million of revenues  respectively 
this decline in revenue  both in real terms and as a percentage of revenue  appears to be largely due to verizon shifting focus away from their traditional wireless network deployments  where our product has historically been installed  to newer g networks 
the mix of customers that represent our next four largest customers has changed year over year but was reflective of a growing trend of our international business becoming a larger percentage of our revenue base 
two customers  other than verizon  accounted for over of our revenue in fiscal and although we have experienced a consistent number of customers representing greater than of our revenues during fiscal  and  the overall dollar magnitude of the revenue from these customers continues to reflect the soft market conditions for our products  as buying decisions continue to be slow to materialize and are generally for more conservative amounts than buying patterns experienced in fiscal and we believe that this protracted buying process and the smaller ordering levels are a function of tighter capital spending budgets and tighter credit markets  as well as uncertainty in the technical direction that companies are looking to take 
this indecision around future network design appears to have made carriers leery to invest heavily in legacy circuit switched technology due to the risk of stranding investments upon conversion to newer network technologies such as voip 
however  on the voip side we are experiencing carriers moving into the voip space in a more conservative manner than was expected by industry analysts  resulting in deployments at a fraction of the size that we are accustomed to seeing for circuit switched network deployments 
the smaller scale version of the pvp that was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal  did result in incremental sales in fiscal  as carriers continue to focus on smaller scale deployments of voice quality technology in their voip networks 
geographically  our domestic revenue for fiscal totaled of total worldwide revenue as compared to and realized in fiscal and  respectively 
as previously mentioned  the increase in the domestic portion of our revenue both in real terms and as a percentage of total revenue was primarily driven by the increased deployment activity at domestic carriers and declining sales into the middle east and portions of south east asia 
our international revenue has primarily been dependent on our success in selling vqa 
although we continue to believe that there are meaningful domestic and international revenue opportunities  we continue to experience slower than anticipated purchasing cycles from our existing and prospective customers  which has resulted in volatility in the level of revenue from quarter to quarter 
we plan to continue to invest in customer trials to attempt to capture the world wide revenue opportunities that exist for us 
we expect that sales of our tdm based bvp flex and qvp products will continue to represent the majority of our revenue in the foreseeable future  as carriers continue to be cautious in their deployment strategies of voip based communications networks 
revenue levels for fiscal will be dependent on our success in adding new customers domestically and internationally  the network technology and deployment plans of the north american telecommunication service providers  the

see item a risk factors for discussions of risks related to customer concentration and other factors  which could impact the timing and level of revenue 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding forward looking statements such as the statements made in the prior paragraphs about our expectations regarding our future revenue  as well as statements regarding our expectations in each of the categories below 
cost of goods sold and gross margin years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cost of goods sold change gross profit gross margin pts pts cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test  configuration and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  post sales installation costs  subcontracted service provider costs associated with our voice services products  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
cost of goods sold remained relatively constant from fiscal to fiscal as a million decline in write downs of excess inventory and million of reduced costs associated with installation and customer service costs due to reductions in force and other cost containment measures  more fully discussed below in the discussion of gross margin  was substantially offset by increased costs associated with increased product shipments and costs associated with our voice services product revenues 
the decrease in cost of goods sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily driven by the decrease in business volume 
our analysis of gross margin below discusses the other factors driving changes in cost of goods sold 
our gross margin percentage increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  largely due to a decline in the level of excess inventory write downs recognized in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced a fundamental shift in demand for two of our products which resulted in a million reserve being recognized 
this compares to a more normalized level of excess inventory write downs being recognized in fiscal of million 
the resulting million decline in write downs of excess inventory accounted for approximately ten percentage points of margin improvement  year over year 
in addition  we experienced approximately million of reduced costs associated with installation and customer service costs due to reductions in force and other cost containment measures completed over the last eighteen months  which represented an additional three percentage points of improved margin 
these improvements in gross margin percentage were partially offset by increased unit shipments of product at slightly lower standard margins  due to product and customer mix  and increased costs associated with our voice services revenue  which combined to result in a two percentage point decrease in the gross margin percentage 
our gross margin percentage decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  largely due to the non product costs included in cost of goods sold  such as manufacturing and post sales installation costs  representing a larger percentage of our revenue 
certain of these costs are relatively fixed in nature and although we did experience a decline in these costs in real terms due to tighter cost control and the reductions in force over the last two years  as revenue levels declined in fiscal these costs become a larger percentage of revenue and therefore adversely impacted our gross margin by approximately eight percentage points 
partially offsetting the adverse movement in margin in fiscal was a decline in the provision of excess inventory  in both real terms and as a percentage of 
table of contents revenue  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  or a two percentage point improvement in gross margin 
in addition  the product and customer mix in fiscal improved slightly from that experienced in fiscal  which further offset the impacts of the non product costs 
all other things being equal  we expect that if our revenue levels increase  gross margin percentages should improve from the current levels as the continued under absorption of manufacturing overheads will become a smaller percentage of a larger revenue base  resulting in improved margins 
however  we could experience declines in our gross margin due to further pricing pressures as we expand the distribution of our products internationally through value added resellers and distributors  which typically demand lower prices than end user customers to allow for a profit to be realized on their resale 
we may also experience a decline in gross margin if our lower margin voice services products become a larger percentage of our overall revenue 
sales and marketing years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands sales and marketing expense of revenue pts pts sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows and outside consulting services 
the decline in sales and marketing spending in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was largely due to realizing the benefit of the reductions in force put in place in fiscal and  as well as other cost control steps taken over the last eighteen months 
as a result of these measures  we experienced a million reduction in payroll and related costs and a million decrease in travel  trade shows and consulting spending 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in the level of agent fees incurred largely due to decline in revenue from customers in the middle east 
lastly  the costs associated with our reduction in force efforts declined million in fiscal see the discussion of reduction in force below 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in variable compensation due to higher sales levels in fiscal the decline in sales and marketing spending in fiscal  as compare to fiscal  was largely due to reductions in salaries and related expenses associated with the reductions in force that were affected in the latter half of fiscal and again in fiscal  which resulted in approximately million in reduced spending in fiscal in conjunction with the reduced headcount and tighter overall cost control over variable spending  we experienced million in reduced spending for travel and related costs and costs associated with marketing programs and trade shows 
we also experienced a decline in sales and marketing variable compensation due to the reduction in sales levels in fiscal lastly  we experienced a decline in stock based compensation of million 
see the discussion regarding the changes in stock based compensation  below 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses in fiscal will decline modestly from fiscal levels due to realizing a full year s worth of cost savings from the reduction in force in mid fiscal and from continued cost controls 
these savings will likely be partially offset by increased variable compensation based on new sales targets for fiscal 
table of contents research and development years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands research and development expense of revenue pts pts research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  materials and supplies used in the development of voice processing products 
the decline in fiscal research and development spending was largely due to realizing the benefit of the reductions in force put in place in fiscal and  as well as other cost control steps taken over the last eighteen months 
as a result of these measures  we experienced a million reduction in payroll and related costs and a million decrease in travel and other spending 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in depreciation due to assets being becoming fully depreciated and retired and a million decline in reduction in force costs in fiscal see the discussion of reduction in force below 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in consulting costs to supplement our internal development efforts 
the decline in fiscal research and development spending was largely due to a million savings in payroll and related spending due to the reductions in force that have been implemented since the middle of fiscal as a result of the reduction in headcount over the last two fiscal years  we have also experienced a decline in allocated common costs due to lower space consumption and use of other support services of million and reduced travel and related costs of million 
lastly  we experienced a decline in stock compensation of million 
see the discussion regarding the changes in stock compensation  below 
we expect to see a further decline in our research and development spending in fiscal as we realize a full year s cost savings from the reduction in force and as we move into a more sustaining engineering mode on our voice services products 
general and administrative years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands general and administrative expense of revenue pts pts general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers  finance and human resources personnel  as well as insurance  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
the decline in spending in fiscal is largely due to realizing the benefit of the reductions in force put in place in fiscal  as well as other cost control steps taken over the last eighteen months 
as a result of these measures  we experienced a million reduction in payroll and related costs 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in legal costs related to favorable resolution of all outstanding legal matters as of the end of fiscal and reductions in outside services and insurance costs aggregating million 
in addition  we experienced a million reduction in reduction in force related costs primarily associated with the fiscal estimated sublease loss recorded related to vacating a portion of our mountain view headquarters 
the decline in spending in fiscal is largely due to million of reduced costs associated with the change in ceo that occurred in fiscal we also experienced a reduction of million 
table of contents associated with payroll savings due to the reductions in force that were implemented over the last two fiscal years and a million reduction in professional services due to favorable developments in our outstanding legal matters and reduced accounting fees related to our adoption of the accounting guidance on uncertain tax positions 
lastly  we experienced a decline in stock based compensation of million 
see the discussion regarding the changes in stock based compensation  below 
we expect general and administrative expenses in fiscal to be flat to modestly down as we continue to closely control spending 
however  these savings may be partially offset by increased compliance costs unless the internal control over financial reporting audit requirements are again deferred for small reporting companies 
amortization of purchased intangible assets years ended april  s in thousands amortization of purchased intangible assets of revenue for the years ended april   and  we recorded amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the jasomi and grid acquisitions 
we are amortizing purchased intangible assets to operating expense over their estimated useful life which ranges from three to five years 
the reduction in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due to the impairment of these assets at the end of fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and other purchase intangibles beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced a decline in our stock price and therefore our market capitalization  due in large part to the decline in our operating results 
as a result of our stock price s continued depressed state and uncertainty as to when our stock price would return to levels sufficient to justify the recovery of our recorded goodwill  we undertook an interim impairment review in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the review  we determined that the entire goodwill balance of million  attributable to the jasomi acquisition  was impaired and therefore recorded an impairment loss in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge related to the purchase intangibles related to the jasomi acquisition 
the impairment charge was due in large part to declining sales levels in the small customer portion of the session border controller market 
there were no further impairment charges for goodwill or purchased intangibles in fiscal or stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense recognized in fiscal  and was as follows years ended april  in thousands cost of goods sold sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total 
table of contents the decline in stock based compensation over the last two fiscal years is due to two key factors 
first and foremost is the reduction in options outstanding and therefore stock compensation linked to the reductions in force that occurred since the end of the second quarter of fiscal the second key element of the decline is linked to the composition of the pool of options for which compensation is being recognized 
as compensation related to older options  which were granted at higher fair values per share due to the stock price at the time of grant  becomes fully amortized  it is being replaced by compensation related to newer option grants which are being issued at lower fair values due to the decline in our stock price 
we expect to continue to experience a declining level of expense related to stock compensation 
reduction in force and other charge 
years ended april  in thousands cost of goods sold sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total in november  we completed a reduction in force in an attempt to continue to reduce operating expenses 
as a result of this reduction in force  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
in addition in december  we completed the sublease of office space vacated in fiscal and we identified additional impairments of fixed assets  which had become idle as a result of the reduction in force and are being held for sale 
as a result of these activities  we recognized a charge in the third quarter of fiscal of approximately million 
all individuals impacted by the reduction in headcount were notified of the termination of their employment in november as of april   the remaining balance in the accrual for the reductions in force of million relates primarily to the estimated loss associated with subleasing vacated space in our mountain view headquarters and to a lesser degree outplacement services and cobra for the reduction in force completed in november in fiscal  we incurred a charge of million related to the reductions in force and related charges  undertaken in the second and third quarters of fiscal  in an effort to reduce spending levels to coincide with the more recent declines we had experienced in our revenue 
these reductions in force resulted in a reduction in headcount during fiscal as a result of the cumulative reductions in force since the second quarter of fiscal  the charges for fiscal included the estimated costs to vacate approximately of the space in our mountain view headquarters and the cost associated with abandoning certain idled fixed assets  resulting in charges of million and million  respectively 
all severance payments associated with the fiscal reductions in force have been paid 
during the second quarter of fiscal   of severance benefits related to outplacement services expired unused and were reversed to the same financial lines to which they were originally recorded in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred a charge of million related to a reduction in force in an effort to reduce spending levels to coincide with the declines we had experienced in our revenue 
the reduction in force involved the closure of our canadian research and development facility and a reduction of approximately in our worldwide headcount 
during fiscal  approximately  related to accrued outplacement services associated with the fiscal reductions in force lapsed without being used and was therefore reversed to the same financial lines to which it was 
table of contents originally recorded in fiscal all other costs associated with the fiscal reduction in force have been incurred 
in addition to the charge related to the reduction in force  we also incurred other one time benefit costs associated with the retirement package for our ceo in august  which totaled approximately million and was included in general and administrative expense  consistent with the recurring costs associated with the ceo 
total other income expense  net years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands total other income expense  net of revenue pts pts total other income expense  net consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalents and investment balances  offset by other than temporary impairment losses on investment securities  interest on convertible debt and a nominal amount of foreign exchange losses 
the decrease in total other expense  net in fiscal is due to a decline in the level of impairment charges recognized related to our auction rate security holdings in fiscal as compare to fiscal  partially offset by reduced interest income due to lower yields on invested cash and lower cash balances and increased interest expense associated with the convertible note issued in fiscal as part of the simulscribe distribution agreement see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in total other income expense  net in fiscal was largely due to a decline in our invested cash balances and declining average interest rates during fiscal  as well as the further impairment loss on one of our investment securities recognized in fiscal of million 
our fiscal other income expense  net will be dependent on our cash balances and the movement of us interest rates 
provision for benefit from income taxes years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes of revenue pts pts income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the tax benefit for fiscal and resulted in an effective rate of less than 
this rate was largely impacted by the continued recording of full valuation allowances against the future tax benefits from the net operating losses generated during the year 
the other factors impacting the effective tax rate were modest levels of international and state taxes  which are not directly tied to our overall operating loss but rather to the level of profitability in these tax jurisdictions 
the tax provision for fiscal resulted in an effective rate of 
this rate was largely impacted by the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in fiscal of million and the non deductible impairment loss related to goodwill 
the other factors impacting the effective tax rate were modest levels of international and state taxes  which are not directly tied to our overall operating loss but rather to the level of profitability in these tax jurisdictions 

table of contents until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  we expect the effective tax rate to be at or close to in fiscal associated with minor levels of taxes for certain state and foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   and  we had cash and cash equivalents and investments totaling million  million and million  respectively 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  and million as of april  as of april   we had million of short term investments as compared to million and million as of april  and  respectively 
at april   and  we also had million  million and million of auction rate securities  which had been classified as long term investments consistent with the maturities of the securities underlying the auction rate instruments  due to uncertainty as to when they may settle 
the decline in our cash and investment balances over the last two years is in large part due to million and million of cash used by operations due to our operating losses during fiscal and  respectively  as well as million used to acquire the simulscribe distribution rights in fiscal as of april   all of our short term and long term investments were held in certificates of deposit and asset backed auction rate securities 
the long term investments are tied to auction rate securities that failed to settle at auction beginning in fiscal  for which there appears to be no near term market 
although these securities would normally be classified as short term  as they typically settle every days  they have been reclassified to long term pending them settling at auction 
as of june   we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of million and a carrying value of million 
we have a million line of credit facility with our bank  which expires in july there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
as of april  we were not in compliance with all the financial covenants 
as of july   we finalized a new line of credit agreement with our bank  which waives the covenant violation as of april  and extends the million line of credit to july since our initial public offering in june  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in fiscal net cash flows from operating activities years ended april  increase from prior year in thousands net cash used in operating activities the negative cash flows from operations is generally associated with the operating losses reported over the last three fiscal yeas due in large part to the soft demand for our products during this period of time 
although we have been successful in reducing our operating expenses by means of reductions in our workforce and tighter control over discretionary spending during the last three years  the reductions have not been sufficient to return us to profitability and positive operating cash flows 
through our efforts to reduce our spending on operating expenses  we believe that as we have been able to create an environment in which our legacy business in the tdm and voip communications equipment are operating at near cash flow break even and that the level of cash used in operations is primarily linked to the investments we are making in our new voice services products  including our phonetag transcription services  toktok and mstage product offerings 

table of contents our days sales outstanding at april  was approximately days compared to days at april  the decline in days sales outstanding was largely due to more favorable distribution of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to we expect to see continued modest levels of negative cash flows from operations in the coming year based on expected continued softness in revenue  while continuing to invest in the launch of our new toktok and mstage products and the distribution of phonetag transcription services 
however  we expect the level of negative cash flows from operations in fiscal to improve slightly from the levels experienced fiscal as we realize the savings from our most recent reductions in force  as we move closer to break even operating results and as we continue to work down our inventory levels 
net cash flows from investing activities years ended april  decrease from prior year in thousands net cash provided by used in investing activities the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal is from two primary causes 
the first is that in fiscal we liquidated a significant portion of our auction rate security positions 
although we did liquidate one additional auction rate security in fiscal  the level of activity declined sharply year over year 
this  coupled with our entering into the exclusive distribution agreement with simulscribe  which used million of cash and our move back into short term certificate of deposit investments in fiscal contributed to substantially all the change 
the change in cash flows from investing activities over the fiscal years and is due primarily to sales and maturities of available for sale investments  which were well in excess of the purchases of available for sale securities as we attempted to exit the volatile market of auction rate securities and invest our cash in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal the cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was largely due to our liquidating short term investments in an effort to free up cash to be used to repurchase million of our stock in fiscal and to a lesser degree our initial steps move our invested cash out of auction rate securities and into more liquid cash and cash equivalent instruments 
we plan to continue to invest in modest levels of capital assets primarily in support of our new product development efforts 
cash flows from financing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year in thousands net cash provided by used in financing activities the limited cash flow from financing activities in fiscal and was due to the limited level of option activity during those years largely due to a large portion of the options being out of the money or only marginally in the money due to the decline in our stock price 
the cash flow used in financing activities in fiscal was largely due to the repurchase of over million shares of our common stock 
the cost of the repurchase totaled million 
this use of 
table of contents cash was slightly offset by funds received from stock option exercises 
we repurchased no common stock in fiscal and we expect that cash flows from financing activities will continue to reflect negligible levels of stock option exercises due to the current price of our stock 
we currently do not plan to do any further stock repurchases in an effort to conserve cash 
stock repurchase programs on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock under a stock repurchase program 
on august   we filed a tender offer to repurchase up to  shares  or approximately million worth  of our common stock 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of million 
the repurchased shares were immediately retired and the aggregate price of the retired shares was reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity 
the purchase price of the shares was allocated between the components of stockholders equity 
commitments we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility lease  normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting and the notes payable issued as part of the simulscribe agreement entered into in fiscal these obligations are all reflected in the table  below 
we also have an earn out obligation under the simulscribe agreement  which could be as much as million depending on the level of revenues achieved during the year term of the agreement  which is not reflected in the table below due to the contingent nature of the obligation 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet of space in the two buildings that form our mountain view  california headquarters 
in september  we renegotiated our mountain view  california lease  which extended the lease term through july  and reduced the rent cost 
in fiscal  we executed a sublease of approximately  square feet of our mountain view headquarters  which we vacated in fiscal due to reduced space needs as a result of the cumulative effect of the reductions in force that we have completed since the second quarter of fiscal our contractual commitments as of april   by year in which they become due  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year to years to years over years operating leases purchase commitments notes payable associated with exclusive distribution agreement total we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve to eighteen months from our existing cash and short term investments and our million operating line of credit with our bank 
the ability to fund our operations beyond the next twelve to eighteen months will depend on the overall demand of telecommunications providers for new capital equipment 
should we continue to experience significantly reduced levels of customer demand for our products compared to historical levels of purchases  we could need to find additional sources of cash during the latter part of fiscal or be forced to further reduce our spending levels to protect our cash reserves 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item of sec regulation s k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term and long term investment portfolios 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are primarily maintained at four major financial institutions in the united states 
as of april  and  we did not hold any derivative instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk  and we attempted to achieve this by diversifying our portfolio in a variety of highly rated investment securities that have limited terms to maturity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but current maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities which prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal management has been able to liquidate on  or day auction cycles  are considered short term investments 
those securities with maturities of greater than one year  including auction rate securities that failed to settle and which based on their nature do not appear likely to settle in the near term  are classified as long term investments 
short and long term investments consist primarily of certificates of deposit  auction rate securities in asset backed securities and corporate notes 
our investment securities are maintained at two major financial institutions  are classified as available for sale  and are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
if we sell our investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale took place 
in fiscal  and  we realized no gains or losses on our investments  but we did recognize an impairment charge of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively on certain of our auction rate securities that failed to settle 
auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments with interest rates that  unless they fail to settle  are reset approximately every  or days 
the underlying securities have contractual maturities which are generally greater than ten years 
the auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
typically  the carrying value of auction rate securities approximates fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates 
as of april  and  we held one auction rate security totaling million of par value  which had an original rating at the time we purchased them of aa but is currently rated cc cc rated ars and has failed to settle at auctions since the second quarter of fiscal the fair value of this auction rate security no longer approximates par value 
accordingly  we have recorded this investment at a fair value of million as of april  million as of april  
due to the prolonged nature and the severity of the decline in the value of the cc rated ars that has failed to settle since the second quarter of fiscal and no clear indication of when it might settle  we determined that the unrealized loss was no longer temporary 
therefore  we have recognized million  million and million of impairment charges in fiscal  and the fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively  on this auction rate security 
we will continue to analyze our auction rate security each reporting period for impairment and may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the statement of operations if a further decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the fair value of this security has been estimated by management based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset in a current transaction  which could change significantly based on market conditions 
our investment securities are not leveraged 
due to the short term nature of our investments  including our ars the interest rates of which reset every to days  they are not subject to significant fluctuations in their fair value due to changes in interest rates 
as such  the recorded fair
