item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we provide an overview of the impact that the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions had on our operations and in the rv  mh  and residential housing industries in we completed the divestitures of certain non core businesses in  including american hardwoods  inc american hardwoods and our aluminum extrusion operation 
see strategic divestitures below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further details 
patrick had three reportable business segments in based on continuing operations primary manufactured products  distribution  and other component manufactured products 
financial information about patrick s three segments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition the rv and mh industries are highly competitive with low barriers to entry 
this level of competition carries through to the suppliers to these industries 
across the company s range of products and services  competition exists primarily on price  product features  quality  and service 
we have several competitors that compete with us on a regional and local basis 
in order for a competitor to compete with us on a national basis  we believe that a substantial capital commitment and investment in personnel would be required 
the other industrial markets in which we continue to expand are also highly competitive 
in  declining sales volumes and the depressed economic conditions in the mh and industrial markets we serve caused extreme pricing pressure on certain products as supply outweighed demand 
we believe that there may be further volatility in the markets we serve in before a sustained recovery takes hold 
given this environment  the company has identified several operating strategies to maintain or enhance earnings through productivity and fixed cost reduction initiatives  expansion into new product lines  and optimization of capacity utilization 
strategy overview we believe that we have developed quality working relationships with our customers and suppliers  and have oriented our business to the needs of these customers 
these customers include all of the larger rv and mh manufacturers and a number of large to medium sized industrial customers 
our industrial customers generally are directly linked to the residential housing markets 
our rv and mh customers generally demand the lowest competitive prices  high quality standards  short lead times  and a high degree of flexibility from their suppliers 
our industrial customers generally are less price sensitive than our rv and mh customers  and more focused on quality customer service and quick response time 
consequently  we have focused our efforts on maintaining and improving the quality of our manufactured products  developing a nationwide manufacturing and distribution presence in response to our customers needs for flexibility and short lead times  and prioritizing the implementation of lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement in all of our facilities including our corporate office 
additionally  because of the short lead times  which range from hours to same day order receipt and delivery  we have intensified our focus on reducing our inventory levels with the help of some of our key suppliers with vendor managed inventory programs 
these initiatives have been instrumental in improving our operating cash flow and liquidity 
as we explore new markets and industries  we believe that these and other strategic initiatives provide us with a strong foundation for future growth 
in  approximately of our sales were to the rv industry  to the mh industry  and to the industrial and other markets 
in  approximately of our sales were to the rv industry  to the mh industry  and to the industrial and other markets 
operating strategies key operating strategies identified by management  include the following strategic acquisitions  expansion and restructuring we supply a broad variety of building material products and  with our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities  we believe that we are well positioned for the introduction of new products 
we  from time to time  consider the acquisition of additional product lines  facilities  companies with a strategic fit  or other assets to complement or expand our existing businesses 
in may  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of adorn  an elkhart  indiana based major manufacturer and supplier to the rv  mh and industrial markets  for million 
this acquisition represented the largest acquisition in our history  virtually doubled our manufacturing revenues  and immediately strengthened our market position and presence in the major industries that we serve 
the consolidation of adorn into patrick afforded us many opportunities to realize synergies through facility rationalization  headcount reduction  vendor consolidation  and the implementation of best practices 
in january  we completed our first acquisition since we acquired adorn with the acquisition of a cabinet door business 
in the third quarter of  the completion of our restructuring plan the restructuring plan to integrate adorn with our existing businesses  resulted in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately million 
expenses associated with the restructuring plan included the closure of duplicate facilities  severance related to the elimination of redundant jobs  and various asset write downs related to the consolidation of product lines 
we have realized  and expect to continue to realize  synergy savings from this acquisition on a go forward basis 
while operating under depressed market and economic conditions throughout  we focused our attention on fixed cost and debt reduction initiatives in order to reduce our leverage ratio  maintain operating cash flow  meet the covenants under our credit agreement and maximize efficiencies from the consolidation of adorn into patrick 
strategic divestitures in an effort to strategically align our current operations with businesses within our core competencies  reduce overall fixed costs  and reduce our leverage position  we have explored and will continue to explore various alternatives for the divestiture of certain unprofitable  non core operations 
in  we identified our american hardwoods and aluminum extrusion operations as non core operations and reclassified the carrying values of the assets of american hardwoods and the aluminum extrusion operation to assets held for sale 
the decision to divest these two operations was largely based on projected and potential operating losses under the current operating model and working capital requirements of these operations that forced us to assess the overall fit of these operations within the parameters of our strategic plan 
the financial results of these operations were classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and all prior period operating results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
sale of american hardwoods  inc operation building in january  the company sold certain assets and the business of the american hardwoods operation for cash consideration of million and entered into a separate real estate purchase agreement with the buyer to sell the building that housed this operation for a purchase price of million 
accordingly  the company reclassified approximately million of carrying value for this property to assets held for sale in the company s consolidated financial statements at december  the building and property were sold in june for a purchase price of million 
the pretax loss from operations was  and million in and  respectively 
the net pretax gain on the sale of the american hardwoods operation was million in estimated pretax charges of approximately million  which primarily reflected the write down to fair market value of real estate and inventories  were included in discontinued operations in previously  the financial results of american hardwoods had been included in the distribution segment 
sale of aluminum extrusion operation in july  the company sold certain assets of its aluminum extrusion operation 
the purchase price resulted in net cash proceeds of million and the assumption by the buyer of approximately million of certain accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the net pretax gain on the sale of the aluminum extrusion operation was million in estimated pretax charges of approximately million associated with the divesture were reflected in discontinued operations in and primarily reflected the write down to fair market value of inventories  real estate and fixed assets 
pretax income from operations was million in and the pretax loss from operations was million in previously  the financial results of this operation comprised the entire engineered solutions business segment 
diversification into other markets while we continually seek to improve our position as a leading supplier to the rv and mh industries and have substantially increased our presence in these markets through the acquisition of adorn in  we are also seeking to expand our product lines into other industrial  commercial and institutional markets 
many of our products  such as countertops  cabinet doors  laminated panels  slotwall  and shelving  have applications in the kitchen cabinet  household furniture  and architectural markets 
we have a dedicated sales force focused on increasing our industrial market penetration and on our diversification into additional commercial and institutional markets 
we believe that diversification into other industrial markets provides opportunities for improved operating margins with products that are complementary in nature to our current manufacturing processes 
in addition  we believe that our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities enable us to position ourselves for new product expansion 
utilization of manufacturing capacity efficiency optimization the acquisition and consolidation of adorn into patrick allowed us to increase capacity utilization at all of our consolidated manufacturing facilities 
while we increased capacity utilization as a result of our facility consolidations  the decline in volume levels due to soft industry conditions in all of the major end markets we serve has resulted in unused capacity at almost all of our locations 
we have the ability to substantially increase volumes in almost all of our existing facilities without adding comparable incremental fixed costs 
with the expected continued weak economic conditions in certain parts of the country  we are continually exploring opportunities for further facility consolidation 
additionally  we are focused on cross training all of our manufacturing work force in our manufacturing cells within each facility to maximize our efficiencies and increase the flexibility of our labor force 
plant consolidations closures and division changes in  we consolidated and closed certain manufacturing and distribution facilities in an effort to align operating costs with our revenue base and keep our overhead structure at a level consistent with operating needs  particularly given the overall soft economic conditions experienced during the year 
in december  the company decided to close its leased distribution facility in woodland  california and consolidate operations into the existing owned fontana  california manufacturing facility in order to offset a sizable reduction in sales volumes that stemmed from the planned closure of one of our major customers plants in the same area 
the consolidation was completed in january during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a listing agreement to sell its custom vinyls manufacturing facility in ocala  florida 
we originally anticipated that the sale of this facility would not be completed until due to unfavorable real estate market conditions  and therefore the property s carrying value was not included in assets held for sale as of december  however  this facility was sold in late december for million resulting in a pretax gain on sale of million 
the ocala operations were consolidated into the company s alabama and georgia facilities 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a listing agreement to sell its manufacturing and distribution facility in woodburn  oregon 
approximately million of carrying value for this facility was reclassified to assets held for sale as of december  the oregon facility was subsequently sold in february for million and the company anticipates recording a pretax gain on sale of approximately million in its first quarter operating results 
the company is currently operating in the same facility under a license agreement with the purchaser while it explores options for a more suitable long term solution 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a listing agreement to sell its remaining manufacturing and distribution facility in fontana  california 
the company reclassified approximately million of carrying value for this facility to assets held for sale in the consolidated financial statements as of december  and in march  this facility was sold and the company anticipates recording a pretax gain on sale of approximately million in its first quarter operating results 
the company is currently operating in the same facility under a lease agreement with the purchaser for the use of approximately one half of the square footage previously occupied 
product development and new product introductions discontinuations with our versatile manufacturing and distribution capabilities  we are continually striving to increase our market presence in all of the markets that we serve and gain entrance into other potential markets 
we remain committed to new product development and introduction initiatives 
new product development is critical to growing our revenue base  keeping up with changing market conditions  and proactively addressing customer demand 
we plan to continue to devote our time and attention to manufacturing and distribution products that fit within the strategic parameters of our current business model including appropriate margin and inventory turn levels 
to further enhance our product offerings to marine and rv customers  we established new relationships with several vendors to distribute a complete line of audio video source units  televisions and microwaves to the marine  rv and recreational product markets 
this newly formed electronics division within our distribution segment was launched in the first quarter of in addition to line extensions of certain products in  we expanded our distribution line to include adhesives and a new laminate flooring product line 
we also began to manufacture interior passage doors to complement our existing door product line 
in early  we discontinued certain distribution product lines including our line of resilient flooring products  a ceramic tile line  and the hardwood products associated with the american hardwoods operation 
principal products through our manufacturing divisions  we manufacture a variety of products including decorative vinyl and paper panels  wrapped moldings  stiles and battens  hardwood  foil and membrane pressed cabinet doors  drawer sides and bottoms  interior passage doors  slotwall and slotwall components  components for electronic desks  and countertops 
in conjunction with our manufacturing capabilities  we also provide value added processes  including custom fabrication  edge banding  drilling  boring  and cut to size capabilities 
we distribute pre finished wall and ceiling panels  drywall and drywall finishing products  electronics  adhesives  cement siding  interior passage doors  roofing products  laminate flooring  and other miscellaneous products 
manufactured laminated panels contributed  and of total sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pre finished wall panels and finishing products contributed   and of total sales for the comparable periods in  and  respectively 
the electronics division within our distribution segment launched in the first quarter of  contributed of total sales for the year ended december  we have no material patents  licenses  franchises  or concessions and do not conduct significant research and development activities 
manufacturing processes and operations our primary manufacturing facilities utilize various materials including gypsum  particleboard  plywood and fiberboard  which are bonded by adhesives or a heating process to a number of products  including vinyl  paper  foil and high pressure laminate 
additionally  we offer high pressure laminate laminated to substrates such as particleboard and lauan which has many uses  including counter tops and ambulance cabinetry 
we manufacture laminate countertops and solid surface countertops  as well as slotwall and slotwall components for the store and office fixture markets 
laminated products are used in the production of wall  cabinet  shelving  counter and fixture products with a wide variety of finishes and textures 
we manufacture three distinct cabinet door product lines in both raised and flat panel designs  as well as square  shaker style  cathedral and arched panels 
one product line is manufactured from raw lumber using solid oak  maple  cherry and other hardwood materials 
another line of doors is made of laminated fiberboard  and a third line uses membrane press technology to produce doors and components with vinyls ranging from mil to mil in thickness 
several outside profiles are available on square  shaker style  cathedral  and arched raised panel doors and the components include rosettes  hardwood moulding  arched window trim  blocks and windowsills  among others 
our doors are sold mainly to the rv and mh industries 
we also market to the cabinet manufacturers and ready to assemble furniture manufacturers 
our vinyl printing facility produces a wide variety of decorative vinyls which are mil in thickness and are shipped in rolls ranging from yards in length 
this facility produces material for both internal and external use 
markets we are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and material for use primarily by the rv and mh industries  and in other industrial markets 
the current downturn in the economy in general and the residential housing market has had an adverse impact on our operations in in the three primary industries in which we operate 
on the rv side  the economic downturn in the fourth quarter of and the first half of severely impacted shipment levels  however  production levels were stronger than expected based on a higher demand for rv s by retail dealers in the latter half of the mh industry continues to be negatively impacted by financing concerns and a lack of available financing sources  and the current credit situation in the residential housing market puts additional pressure on consumers  who are generally using financial institutions and conventional financing as a source for these purchases 
we expect the overall declines experienced in the mh and industrial markets in to continue into the first half of recreational vehicle purchases are generally consumer discretionary income purchases  and therefore any situation which causes concerns related to discretionary income has a negative impact on these markets 
approximately of our industrial revenue base is associated with the us residential housing market  and therefore there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing production 
recreational vehicles the recreational vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand reflecting prevailing general economic conditions which affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
we believe that fluctuations in interest rates  consumer confidence  and concerns about the availability and price of gasoline have an impact on rv sales 
demographic and ownership trends continue to point to favorable market growth in the long term as the number of baby boomers reaching retirement is steadily increasing  products such as sports utility rv s are becoming attractive to younger buyers  and rv manufacturers are also providing an array of product choices including producing lightweight towables and smaller  fuel efficient motorhomes 
green technologies including lightweight composite materials  solar panels  and energy efficient components are appearing on an increasing number of rvs 
in addition  federal economic credit and stimulus packages that contain provisions to stimulate rv lending and provide favorable tax treatment for new rv purchases  may help promote sales and aid in the rv industry s economic recovery 
recreational vehicle classifications are based upon standards established by the rvia 
the principal types of recreational vehicles include conventional travel trailers  folding camping trailers  fifth wheel trailers  motor homes  and conversion vehicles 
these recreational vehicles are distinct from mobile homes  which are manufactured houses designed for permanent and semi permanent residential dwelling 
conventional travel trailers and folding camping trailers are non motorized vehicles designed to be towed by passenger automobiles  pick up trucks  or vans 
they provide comfortable  self contained living facilities for short periods of time 
conventional travel trailers and folding camping trailers are towed by means of a frame hitch attached to the towing vehicle 
fifth wheel trailers  designed to be towed by pick up trucks  are constructed with a raised forward section that is attached to the bed area of the pick up truck 
this allows for a bi level floor plan and more living space than a conventional travel trailer 
a motor home is a self powered vehicle built on a motor vehicle chassis 
the interior typically includes a driver s area  kitchen  bathroom  dining  and sleeping areas 
motor homes are self contained with their own lighting  heating  cooking  refrigeration  sewage holding  and water storage facilities 
although they are not designed for permanent or semi permanent living  motor homes do provide comfortable living facilities for short periods of time 
sales of recreational vehicle products have been cyclical 
shortages of motor vehicle fuels and significant increases in fuel prices have had a material adverse effect on the market for recreational vehicles in the past  and could adversely affect demand in the future 
the rv industry is also affected by the availability and terms of financing to dealers and retail purchasers 
substantial increases in interest rates and decreases in the general availability of credit have had a negative impact upon the industry in the past and may do so in the future 
recession and lack of consumer confidence generally result in a decrease in the sale of leisure time products such as recreational vehicles 
since  industry wide wholesale unit shipments of rv s have declined 
the period beginning in and continuing through resulted in eight out of the nine years with shipment levels over  units primarily due to the favorable demographic trend of the aging baby boomer population  improved consumer confidence  depleted dealer inventories  lower interest rates  and a fear of flying after the september  terrorist attacks 
shipment levels started to soften in the third and fourth quarters of and into in  shipment levels declined approximately to  units reflecting the tightest credit conditions in several decades  declining consumer confidence  reduced disposable income levels  and the generally depressed economic environment 
in  shipment levels declined approximately versus  reflecting low consumer confidence and the continuance of unfavorable market conditions experienced by the industry in however  production levels in the rv industry were stronger than expected in the latter half of based on a higher demand for rv s by retail dealers 
in anticipation of continued strengthening short term demand  the recreational vehicle industry association the rvia is currently forecasting a increase in full year wholesale unit shipments to  units compared to the full year level citing an improvement in dealer demand as evidenced in the second half of and an increase in capacity by certain new and existing manufacturers that have also added to their workforce 
according to the rvia  the recovery is expected to strengthen as credit availability  job security and consumer confidence improve 
the company estimates that approximately of its revenues related to the rv industry are derived from the towables sector of the market 
in  the towables sector of the rv market represented approximately of total units shipped into the market as a whole 
the towable units are lighter and less expensive than standard gas or diesel powered units representing a more attractive solution for the cost conscious buyer 
from to  motorized unit shipments declined approximately and towable unit shipments declined approximately 
we believe that we are well positioned with respect to our product mix within the rv industry to take advantage of any improved market conditions 
the following chart reflects the historical wholesale unit shipment levels in the rv industry from through per rvia statistics manufactured housing manufactured homes traditionally have been one of the principal means for first time homebuyers to overcome the obstacles of large down payments and higher monthly mortgage payments due to the relative lower cost of construction as compared to site built homes 
manufactured housing also presents an affordable alternative to site built homes for retirees and others desiring a lifestyle in which home ownership is less burdensome than in the case of site built homes 
the increase in square footage of living space and updated modern designs in manufactured homes created by multi sectional models has made them more attractive to a larger segment of homebuyers 
manufactured homes are built in accordance with national  state and local building codes 
manufactured homes are factory built and transported to a site where they are installed  often permanently 
some manufactured homes have design limitations imposed by the constraints of efficient production and over the road transit 
delivery expense limits the effective competitive shipping range of the manufactured homes to approximately to miles 
modular homes  which are a component of the manufactured housing industry  are factory built homes that are built in sections and transported to the site for installation 
these homes are generally set on a foundation and are subject to land home financing terms and conditions 
in recent years  these units have been gaining in popularity due to their aesthetic similarity to site built homes and their relatively less expensive cost 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and is affected by the availability of alternative housing  such as apartments  town houses  condominiums and site built housing 
in addition  interest rates  availability of financing  regional population  employment trends  and general regional economic conditions affect the sale of manufactured homes 
since  industry wide wholesale unit shipments of manufactured homes have declined 
the level of  wholesale units was at the lowest level in the last years 
mh unit shipments declined approximately when compared to factors that may favorably impact production levels in this industry include quality credit standards in the residential housing market  job growth  favorable changes in financing laws  new tax credits for new home buyers and other government incentives  a lack of residential housing inventory  and rising interest rates that make traditional site built homes more expensive to finance 
the company currently estimates mh unit shipments for full year to decline approximately compared to full year levels 
we believe that the factors responsible for the past decade plus decline include lack of available financing and access to the asset backed securities markets  high vacancy rates in apartments  high levels of repossessed housing inventories  over built housing markets in certain regions of the country that resulted in fewer sales of new manufactured homes  as well as the generally depressed economic environment 
additionally  low conventional mortgage rates and less restrictive lending terms for residential site built housing over much of this period contributed to the decline as manufactured home loans generally carry a higher interest rate and less competitive terms 
beginning in mid and continuing through  the mh industry has also had to contend with credit requirements that became more stringent and a reduction in availability of lenders for manufactured homes for both retail and dealers 
while there is demand for permanent rebuilding in the hurricane damaged areas  credit conditions remain adverse especially in conjunction with the current credit crisis  and current overall economic conditions are not favorable in relation to the factors which will promote positive growth 
the availability of financing and access to the asset backed securities market is still restricted  and we believe that employment growth and standard quality oriented lending practices in the conventional site built housing markets are needed to enable more balanced demand  thus resulting in the potential for increased production and shipment levels in the mh industry 
the following chart reflects the historical wholesale unit shipment levels in the mh industry from through per the manufactured housing institute other markets many of our core manufacturing products  including paper vinyl laminated panels  shelving  drawer sides  and high pressure laminated panels are routinely utilized in the kitchen cabinet  store fixture and commercial furnishings  and residential furniture markets 
these markets are generally categorized by a more performance than price driven customer base  and provide an opportunity for us to diversify our clientele while providing increased contribution to our core laminating and fabricating competencies 
while the residential furniture markets have been severely impacted by import pressures  other segments have been less vulnerable  and therefore provide opportunities for increased sales penetration and market share gains 
while demand for our products in the residential market has been adversely impacted by the severe housing downturn  long term growth in the residential market will be based on improved job growth  low interest rates  and continuing government incentives to stimulate housing demand and reduce surplus inventory due to foreclosures  which we believe will ultimately increase the demand for our products 
demand in the industrial markets in which the company competes also fluctuates with economic cycles 
industrial demand tends to lag the housing cycle by six to twelve months  and will vary based on differences in regional economic prospects 
as a result  we believe continued focus on the industrial markets will help moderate the impact of the cyclical patterns in the rv mh markets on our operating results 
we have the available capacity to increase industrial revenue and benefit from the diversity of multiple market segments  unique regional economies and varied customer strategies 
marketing and distribution our sales are to recreational vehicle and manufactured housing manufacturers and other industrial products manufacturers 
we have approximately  customers 
we have five customers  who together accounted for approximately and of our total sales in and  respectively 
we believe we have good relationships with our customers 
sales to three different customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of consolidated net sales of the company for the year ended december  sales to two different customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated net sales for the year ended december  no one customer accounted for or more of consolidated net sales for the year ended december  most products for distribution are generally purchased in carload or truckload quantities  warehoused  and then sold and delivered by us 
in addition  approximately and of our distribution segment s products were shipped directly from the suppliers to our customers in and  respectively 
we typically experience a one to two week delay between issuing our purchase orders and the delivery of products to our warehouses or customers 
as lead times have declined over the years  in some instances  certain customers have required same day or next day service 
we generally keep backup supplies of various commodity products in our warehouses to ensure that we have product on hand at all times for our distribution customers 
our customers do not maintain long term supply contracts  and therefore we must bear the risk of accurate advanced estimation of customer orders 
we have no significant backlog of orders 
we operate warehouse and distribution centers and manufacturing operations located in alabama  arizona  california  georgia  illinois  indiana  kansas  minnesota  oregon  pennsylvania  tennessee and texas 
by using these facilities  we are able to minimize our in transit delivery time and cost to the regional manufacturing plants of our customers 
patrick does not engage in significant marketing efforts nor does it incur significant marketing or advertising expenditures other than attendance at certain trade shows and the activities of its sales personnel and the maintenance of customer relationships through price  quality of its products  service and customer satisfaction 
in our design showroom located in elkhart  indiana  many of our manufactured and distribution products are on display for current and potential customers 
we believe that the design showroom has provided patrick with the opportunity to grow its market share by educating our customers regarding the style and content options that we have available and by offering custom design services to further differentiate our product lines 
suppliers during the year ended december   we purchased approximately of our raw materials and distributed products from twenty different suppliers 
the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately of our purchases 
our current major material suppliers with contracts through december  include united states gypsum  mjb wood group and tumac lumber company 
we have terms and conditions with these and other suppliers that specify exclusivity in certain areas  pricing structures  rebate agreements and other parameters 
materials are primarily commodity products  such as lauan  gypsum  particleboard  and other lumber products  which are available from many suppliers 
we maintain a long term supply agreement with one of our major suppliers of materials to the mh industry 
our sales in the short term could be negatively impacted in the event any unforeseen negative circumstances were to affect our major supplier 
we believe that we have a good relationship with this supplier and all of our other suppliers 
alternate sources of supply are available for all of our major material purchases 
regulation and environmental quality the company s operations are subject to certain federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during their manufacturing processes 
over the past two and one half years  patrick has taken a proactive role in certifying that the composite wood substrate materials that it uses to produce products for its customers in the rv marketplace have complied with applicable emission standards developed by the california air resources board carb 
all suppliers and manufacturers of composite wood materials will be required to be either carb i or carb ii certified at some point in the near future 
we believe that we are currently operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and have made reports and submitted information as required 
the company believes that the expense of compliance with these laws and regulations with respect to environmental quality  as currently in effect  will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or competitive position  and will not require any material capital expenditures for plant or equipment modifications which would adversely affect earnings 
seasonality manufacturing operations in the rv and mh industries historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the climate is moderate 
accordingly  the company s sales and profits are generally highest in the second and third quarters 
however  depressed economic conditions in both industries distorted the historical trends in rv unit shipments did not experience their normal seasonal sales decline in the fourth quarter of as they generally have in prior years 
employees as of december   we had employees  of which were engaged directly in production  warehousing  and delivery operations  in sales  and in office and administrative activities 
there were no manufacturing plants or distribution centers covered by collective bargaining agreements 
patrick continuously reviews benefits and other matters of interest to its employees and considers its relations with its employees to be good

item a 
risk factors the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks related to its business 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on form k 
all of these risks should be carefully considered 
our results of operations have been  and may continue to be  adversely impacted by a worldwide macroeconomic downturn 
in  general worldwide economic conditions continued to experience a downturn due to the effects of the deterioration in the residential housing market  subprime lending crisis  general credit market crisis  collateral effects on the finance and banking industries  increased commodity costs  volatile energy costs  concerns about inflation  slower economic activity  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns the economic crisis 
these conditions have adversely affected demand in the three major end markets we serve the recreational vehicle  manufactured housing and industrial markets  resulting in decreased sales of our component products into these markets and could negatively affect our operations and result in lower sales  income  and cash flows 
in addition  it has become more difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and ultimately our profitability has been adversely affected 
if our business conditions continue to deteriorate  we may be forced to close and or consolidate certain of our operating facilities  sell assets  and or reduce our workforce  which may result in our incurring restructuring charges 
we cannot predict the duration of the economic downturn  the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery or the extent to which the economic downturn will continue to negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the current economic downturn in the residential housing market has had an adverse impact on our operations  and is expected to continue into the residential housing market has experienced overall declines and credit concerns that are expected to continue into approximately of our industrial revenue is directly or indirectly influenced by conditions in the residential housing market 
the decline in demand for residential housing and the tightening of consumer credit have lowered demand for our industrial products and have had an adverse impact on our operations as a whole 
in addition  the impact of the sub prime mortgage crisis and housing downturn on consumer confidence  discretionary spending  and general economic conditions has decreased and may continue to decrease demand for our products sold to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries 
we may incur significant charges or be adversely impacted by the closure of all or part of a manufacturing or distribution facility 
we periodically assess the cost structure of our operating facilities to distribute and or manufacture and sell our products in the most efficient manner 
based on our assessments  we may make capital investments to move  discontinue manufacturing and or distribution capabilities  sell or close all or part of a manufacturing and or distribution facility 
in january  we closed our leased distribution facility in woodland  california and consolidated operations into the existing owned fontana  california manufacturing facility in order to offset a sizable reduction in sales volumes that stemmed from the planned closure of one of our major customer s plants in the same area 
the fontana facility was subsequently sold in march and we are currently operating in the same facility under a lease agreement with the purchaser for the use of approximately one half of the square footage previously occupied 
we have incurred charges in the first quarter of related to downsizing our operations in this facility and to accommodate the use of this facility by two different parties 
in addition  we closed and sold our manufacturing facility in ocala  florida in late and consolidated its operations into our alabama and georgia facilities 
our manufacturing and distribution facility in oregon was sold in february and we are currently operating in the same facility under a license agreement with the purchaser while we explore options for a more suitable long term solution 
these changes could result in significant future charges or disruptions in our operations  and we may not achieve the expected benefits from these changes which could result in an adverse impact on our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the financial condition of our customers and suppliers may deteriorate as a result of the current economic environment and competitive conditions in their markets 
the economic crisis may lead to increased levels of restructurings  bankruptcies  liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers  suppliers and other service providers and financial institutions with whom we do business 
such events could  in turn  negatively affect our business either through loss of sales or inability to meet our commitments or inability to meet them without excess expense because of loss of suppliers or other providers 
in addition  several of our major customers are undergoing unprecedented financial distress which may result in such customers undergoing major restructuring  reorganization or other significant changes 
the occurrence of any such event could have further adverse consequences to our business including a decrease in demand for our products 
if such customers become insolvent or file for bankruptcy  our ability to recover accounts receivables from those customers would be adversely affected and any payments we received in the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially recoverable by the bankruptcy trustee 
many of our customers participate in highly competitive markets  and their financial condition may deteriorate as a result 
a decline in the financial condition of our customers could hinder our ability to collect amounts owed by customers 
in addition  such a decline could result in lower demand for our products and services 
we have a number of large customers  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we have a number of customers which account for a significant percentage of our net sales 
specifically  two customers in the rv market accounted for a combined  and another customer in the mh market accounted for of consolidated net sales in the loss of any of these large customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we do not have long term agreements with customers and cannot predict that we will maintain our current relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply them at current levels 
the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries are highly competitive  and some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do 
we operate in a highly competitive business environment and our sales could be negatively impacted by our inability to maintain or increase prices  changes in geographic or product mix  or the decision of our customers to purchase our competitors products instead of our products 
we compete not only with other suppliers to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle producers  but also with suppliers to traditional site built homebuilders and suppliers of cabinetry and flooring 
sales could also be affected by pricing  purchasing  financing  advertising  operational  promotional  or other decisions made by purchasers of our products 
additionally  we cannot control the decisions made by suppliers of our distributed and manufactured products and therefore our ability to maintain our exclusive and non exclusive distributor contracts and agreements may be adversely impacted 
as a result of highly competitive market conditions in the industries in which we participate  some of our competitors have been forced to seek bankruptcy protection 
these competitors may emerge from bankruptcy protection with stronger balance sheets and a desire to gain market share by offering below market pricing  which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 
seasonality and cyclical economic conditions affect the rv and mh markets the company serves 
the rv and mh markets are cyclical and dependent upon various factors  including the general level of economic activity  consumer confidence  interest rates  access to financing  inventory and production levels  and the cost of fuel 
economic and demographic factors can cause substantial fluctuations in production  which in turn impact sales and operating results 
demand for recreational vehicles and manufactured housing generally declines during the winter season 
our sales levels and operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in any of these items 
the cyclical nature of the domestic housing market has caused our sales and operating results to fluctuate 
these fluctuations may continue in the future  which could result in operating losses during downturns 
the us housing industry is highly cyclical and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors  including terms and availability of financing for homebuyers and retailers  consumer confidence  interest rates  population and employment trends  income levels  housing demand  and general economic conditions  including inflation  deflation and recessions 
the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries and the industrial markets are affected by the fluctuations in the residential housing market 
as a result of the foregoing factors  our sales and operating results fluctuate  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
moreover  cyclical and seasonal downturns in the residential housing market may cause us to experience operating losses 
fuel shortages  or higher prices for fuel  have had  and could continue to have  an adverse impact on our operations 
the products produced by the rv industry typically require gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation  or the use of a vehicle requiring gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation 
there can be no assurance that the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel will continue uninterrupted or that the price of or tax on fuel will not significantly increase in the future 
shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel have had a significant adverse effect on the demand for recreational vehicles in the past and would be expected to have a material adverse effect on demand in the future 
rapid significant increases in fuel prices  as we experienced in recent years  appear to affect the demand for recreational vehicles when gasoline prices reach unusually high levels 
such a reduction in overall demand for recreational vehicles could have a materially adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
approximately and of our sales were to the rv industry for and for  respectively 
in  we expect an even higher percentage of our total sales to be concentrated in the rv industry than in due to forecasted growth in the rv industry and continued softness in the mh and industrial markets 
dependence on third party suppliers and manufacturers 
generally  our raw materials  supplies and energy requirements are obtained from various sources and in the quantities desired 
while alternative sources are available  our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in the delivery 
fluctuations in the prices of these requirements may be driven by the supply demand relationship for that commodity or governmental regulation 
in addition  if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated  the availability or price of these requirements could be adversely affected 
increased cost and limited availability of raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
prices of certain materials  including gypsum  lauan  particleboard  mdf  and other commodity products  can be volatile and change dramatically with changes in supply and demand 
certain products are purchased from overseas and are dependent upon vessel shipping schedules and port availability 
further  certain of our commodity product suppliers sometimes operate at or near capacity  resulting in some products having the potential of being put on allocation 
we generally have been able to maintain adequate supplies of materials and to pass higher material costs on to our customers in the form of surcharges and base price increases where needed 
however  it is not certain that future price increases can be passed on to our customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities 
the current credit crisis and its impact on the financial and housing markets may also impact our suppliers and affect the availability or pricing of materials 
our sales levels and operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in any of these items 
we are subject to governmental and environmental regulations  and failure in our compliance efforts could result in damages  expenses or liabilities that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing businesses are subject to various governmental and environmental regulations 
implementation of new regulations or amendments to existing regulations could significantly increase the cost of the company s products 
certain components of manufactured and modular homes are subject to regulation by the us consumer product safety commission 
we currently use materials that we believe comply with government regulations 
we cannot presently determine what  if any  legislation may be adopted by congress or state or local governing bodies  or the effect any such legislation may have on us or the manufactured housing industry 
in addition  failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines or potential civil or criminal liability 
both scenarios could negatively our results of operations or financial condition 
the inability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and key personnel may adversely affect our operations 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could reduce our ability to manage our business and strategic plan in the short term and could cause our sales and operating results to decline 
our ability to integrate acquired businesses may adversely affect operations 
as part of our business and strategic plan  we look for strategic acquisitions to provide shareholder value 
any acquisition will require the effective integration of an existing business and its administrative  financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing and other functions to maximize synergies 
acquired businesses involve a number of risks that may affect our financial performance  including increased leverage  diversion of management resources  assumption of liabilities of the acquired businesses  and possible corporate culture conflicts 
if we are unable to successfully integrate these acquisitions  we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process  and our financial results may be negatively impacted 
additionally  significant unexpected liabilities could arise from these acquisitions 
increased levels of indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of total debt of which million was under our senior secured credit facility the credit facility and million was related to our economic development revenue bonds 
our indebtedness  which was primarily the result of the adorn acquisition in  as well as a greater need for working capital  may harm our financial condition and negatively impact our results of operations 
the level of indebtedness could have consequences on our future operations  including i making it more difficult for us to meet our payments on outstanding debt  ii an event of default  if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the credit agreement governing the credit facility the credit agreement  which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable  iii reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  iv limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  v placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged  and vi creating concerns about our credit quality which could result in the loss of supplier contracts and or customers 
while we will be working with our current lenders or otherwise during to execute a new long term credit facility prior to its scheduled expiration on january   there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness 
our credit facility contains various financial performance and other covenants with which we must remain in compliance 
if we do not remain in compliance with these covenants  our senior secured credit facility could be terminated and the amounts outstanding thereunder could become immediately due and payable 
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding that contains financial and non financial covenants with which we must comply that place restrictions on our subsidiaries and us 
without improvements from the conditions in the current economic downturn in  there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance during with the financial covenants as modified by the fourth amendment to the credit agreement in december the fourth amendment 
these covenants are measured on a quarterly basis and require that we attain minimum levels of consolidated ebitda as defined by our credit agreement 
if we fail to comply with our covenants under the fourth amendment  the lenders could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity or it could result in our having to refinance the related indebtedness under unfavorable terms 
if our debt were accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full 
if current unfavorable credit market conditions were to persist throughout  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness 
for additional details and discussion concerning these financial covenants see liquidity and capital resources in item of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements 
industry conditions and our operating results have limited our sources of capital in the past 
if we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed  we may be unable to maintain or expand our business 
we depend on our cash balances  our cash flows from operations  our credit agreement  and potentially borrowing against our corporate owned life insurance policies to finance our operating requirements  capital expenditures and other needs 
if the general economic conditions that prevailed during and the first quarter of continue or worsen  production of rvs and manufactured homes will likely decline  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
a further decline in our operating results could negatively impact our liquidity 
in addition  the downturn in the mh and rv industries  combined with our operating results and other changes  has limited our sources of financing in the past 
if our cash balances  cash flows from operations  and availability under our credit agreement are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available  we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions  or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations 
we have letters of credit representing collateral for our casualty insurance programs and for general operating purposes 
the letters of credit are issued under our credit agreement 
for additional detail and information concerning the amounts of our letters of credit  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the inability to retain our current letters of credit  to obtain alternative letter of credit sources  or to retain our current credit agreement to support these programs could require us to post cash collateral  reduce the amount of cash available for our operations or cause us to curtail or limit existing operations 
increased levels of inventory may adversely affect our profitability 
our customers generally do not maintain long term supply contracts and  therefore  we must bear the risk of advanced estimation of customer orders 
we maintain an inventory to support these customers needs 
changes in demand  market conditions and or product specifications could result in material obsolescence and a lack of alternative markets for certain of our customer specific products and could negatively impact operating results 
we may be subject to additional charges for impairment of assets  including goodwill  other long lived assets and deferred tax assets  due to potential declines in the fair value of those assets or a decline in expected profitability of the company or individual reporting units of the company 
a portion of our total assets as of december  was comprised of goodwill  amortizable intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment 
under generally accepted accounting principles  each of these assets is subject to periodic review and testing to determine whether the asset is recoverable or realizable 
the events or changes that could require us to test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment include a reduction in our stock price and market capitalization and changes in our estimated future cash flows  as well as changes in rates of growth in our industry or in any of our reporting units 
in the future  if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
significant impairment charges  although not always affecting current cash flow  could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
a variety of factors could influence fluctuations in the market price for our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future in response to a number of factors  including those discussed below 
the market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate 
some of the factors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate include variations in our and our competitors operating results  historically low trading volume  high concentration of shares held by institutional investors and in particular our majority shareholder  tontine capital partners  lp and affiliates collectively  tontine capital  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  the gain or loss of significant customers  additions or departure of key personnel  events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us  general conditions in industries in which we operate  general conditions in the united states and abroad  the presence or absence of short selling of our common stock  future sales of our common stock or debt securities  announcements by us or our competitors of technological improvements or new products  and the disclosure by tontine capital in november that it will begin to explore alternatives for the disposition of its equity interests in the company 
fluctuations in the stock market may have an adverse effect upon the price of our common stock 
the stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations 
these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
holders of our common stock are subject to the risk of dilution of their investment as the result of the issuance to our lenders of warrants to purchase common stock 
as part of the consideration for amending our credit agreement on december   we entered into a warrant agreement under which we issued to our lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of the warrants 
the warrants are immediately exercisable  subject to anti dilution provisions and expire on december  pursuant to the anti dilution provisions  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants was increased to an aggregate of  shares and the exercise price was adjusted to per share during the exercise of the warrants would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock 
the renegotiation and extension of our current credit facility that expires on january   or any replacement credit facility  could involve the issuance of additional warrants or other equity based arrangements 
a majority of our common stock is held by tontine capital  which has the ability to control all matters requiring shareholder approval and whose interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
in addition  the ownership of a significant portion of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of a few holders 
as of march   tontine capital owned  shares of our common stock or approximately of our total common stock outstanding 
as a result of its majority interest  tontine capital has the ability to control all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of our directors  the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation  the approval of mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  decisions affecting our capital structure and other significant corporate transactions 
in addition to its majority interest  pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with tontine capital  dated april   if tontine capital i holds between and of our common stock then outstanding  tontine capital has the right to appoint one nominee to our board  or ii holds at least of our common stock then outstanding  tontine capital has the right to appoint two nominees to our board 
tontine capital s rights related to the appointment of directors were affirmed in a subsequent securities purchase agreement with tontine capital  dated march  on july   a nominee of tontine capital was appointed to the board 
as of march   tontine capital has one director on the company s board of directors and has not exercised its right to nominate a second director to the board 
the interests of tontine capital may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
the influence of tontine capital may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers  delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management  or limiting the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 
in addition  tontine capital and its affiliates are in the business of investing in companies and may  from time to time  invest in companies that compete directly or indirectly with us 
tontine capital and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and  as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
we are not able to predict whether or when tontine capital or the other institutions will sell or otherwise dispose of substantial amounts of our common stock 
sales or other dispositions of our common stock by these institutions could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition  we were aware of four other institutions that collectively own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december tontine capital indicated in a filing with the sec that it would begin to explore alternatives for the disposition of its equity interests in the company 
this filing  and any future dispositions of stock by tontine capital  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
on november   tontine capital filed with the sec an amendment to its previously filed schedule d with respect to its ownership of common stock of the company 
tontine capital stated that it would begin to explore alternatives for the disposition of its equity interests in the company  which alternatives may include a dispositions of our common stock through open market sales  underwritten offerings and or privately negotiated sales  b a sale of the company  or c distributions by tontine capital of its shares to its investors 
the public disclosure of such possible disposition may adversely affect the market price for our common stock due to the large number of shares involved 
in addition  we are not able to predict whether or when tontine capital will dispose of its stock 
any such future disposition of stock by tontine capital may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in march  tontine capital disclosed that it had reallocated the ownership of certain shares of common stock of the company owned by it to a new investment fund  tontine capital overseas master fund ii  lp tcomf 
the aggregate common stock ownership of tontine capital following the reallocation did not change 
in addition  tontine capital disclosed that tcomf may hold and or dispose of such securities or may purchase additional securities of the company  at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws may delay  defer or prevent a change in control that our shareholders each might consider to be in their best interest 
our articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them unacceptably expensive to the raider  and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
we have in place a rights agreement which permits under certain circumstances each holder of common stock  other than potential acquirers  to purchase one one hundredth of a share of a newly created series of our preferred stock at a purchase price of or to acquire additional shares of our common stock at of the current market price 
the rights are not exercisable or transferable until a person or group acquires or more of our outstanding common stock  except with respect to tontine capital and its affiliates and associates  which are exempt from the provisions of the rights agreement pursuant to an amendment signed on march  the effects of the rights agreement would be to discourage a stockholder from attempting to take over our company without negotiating with our board of directors 
insurance coverages and terms and conditions 
we negotiate our insurance contracts annually for property  casualty  workers compensation  general liability  health insurance  and directors and officers liability coverage 
due to conditions within these insurance markets and other factors beyond our control  future coverage limits  terms and conditions and the amount of the related premiums could have a negative impact on our operating results 
while we continually measure the risk reward of policy limits and coverage  the lack of coverage in certain circumstances could result in potential uninsured losses

in addition  the company entered into a listing agreement in march to sell its manufacturing and distribution facility in new london  north carolina

patrick s major manufactured products include decorative vinyl and paper panels  wrapped moldings  interior passage doors  cabinet doors and components  slotwall and slotwall components  and countertops 
the company also distributes drywall and drywall finishing products  electronics  adhesives  cement siding  interior passage doors  roofing products  laminate flooring  and other related products 
the company has three reportable business segments primary manufactured products  distribution and other component manufactured products  which contributed approximately  and  respectively  to net sales 
overview of markets and related industry performance throughout the majority of  recreational vehicle rv and manufactured housing mh retailers and manufacturers continued to aggressively manage their inventory levels in response to restricted credit conditions and weakening economic trends  which in turn reduced demand and negatively impacted the sales of the company s products 
while uncertainty surrounding the future course of the global economy has helped fuel the decline in rv and mh sales compared to prior periods  production levels in the rv industry were stronger than expected based on a higher demand for rv s by retail dealers in the latter half of in the mh sector  monthly shipments have been flat with nominal seasonal improvement and continue to be well below historical levels  especially given the current unstable condition in the residential housing market 
the continuation of the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions in all sectors of the economy in  including restricted availability of capital  high unemployment  negative job growth  low consumer confidence levels  and a decline in discretionary spending all contributed to the negative impact on all three of the major markets the company serves 
according to industry sources  the rv industry  which represents approximately of the company s sales  experienced unit shipment declines in the first three quarters of compared to the prior year 
the rv industry began to show signs of recovery in the fourth quarter of as unit shipments increased approximately over the fourth quarter of this quarter over quarter increase in unit shipment levels represented the first quarter over quarter increase since for full year  rv unit shipment levels experienced unit shipment declines of approximately to finish at  units 
the year marked only the second year in the last eight years that shipment levels fell below the  unit level and represented the third decline in the last four years 
while the full restoration of rv sales to prior levels is projected to be slow  many of our existing customers have indicated that they envision increased production in compared to long term demographic trends favor rv industry growth fueled by the anticipated positive impact that aging baby boomers are estimated to have on the industry once the industry recovers from the current economic crisis 
in addition  federal economic credit and stimulus packages  which include provisions to stimulate rv purchases and provide favorable tax treatment for new rv purchases  may help promote sales and aid in the rv industry s economic recovery 
demographic trends point to positive conditions for this particular market sector in the long term 
dealer demand improved in the second  third and fourth quarters of and certain new and existing manufacturers have increased capacity and added to their workforce 
in anticipation of continued strengthening short term demand  the recreational vehicle industry association rvia is predicting a increase in full year unit shipments compared to the full year level 
based on this estimated increase in unit shipments in the rv market compared to the softness in the other primary market sectors in which patrick operates  the company expects its rv market sales concentration to increase in mh wholesale unit shipments continued to show weakness and reflected consecutive quarters of declining shipments compared to prior periods 
according to industry sources  the mh industry  which represents approximately of the company s revenue base for  continued to experience shipment declines of approximately versus the prior year and finished the year with shipments at approximately  units  levels not seen since growth in the mh industry continues to be negatively impacted by restricted credit conditions  large inventories of traditional site built homes  and a significant number of foreclosed homes that are available 
factors that may favorably impact production levels in this industry include credit quality standards in the residential housing market  improved job growth  favorable changes in financing laws  new tax credits for new home buyers and other government incentives  and rising interest rates that make traditional site built homes relatively more expensive to finance 
the company currently estimates mh unit shipments for full year to decline approximately compared to full year levels 
the weak conditions in the mh industry dramatically impacted the company s distribution segment  which saw sales decline from the prior year by approximately as approximately of the company s sales in this segment are associated with the mh industry 
additionally  pricing on gypsum related commodity products that the company sells into the mh industry rose approximately year over year on manufactured products and approximately on distribution products 
the industrial and other markets represent approximately of the company s revenue base for the company estimates that approximately of our revenue base in these industries is linked to the residential housing market which continued to be impacted by depressed conditions as new housing starts for were down approximately from the comparable period in as reported by the us department of commerce 
there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing construction 
in addition  the renewal of the first time homebuyer s credit and reductions in unemployment could build additional momentum in this market 
the national association of homebuilders as of february  forecasted a increase in total housing starts and a increase in existing single family home sales in compared to the company expects the predicted growth in new construction and existing home sales to positively influence its presence in these markets during the second half of in the long term  residential expenditure growth will be based on job growth  affordable interest rates  and lingering government incentives to stimulate housing demand and reduce surplus inventory due to foreclosures 
in addition  higher energy costs continue to affect the costs of raw materials 
the company continues to explore alternative sources of raw materials and components  both domestically and from overseas 
recently there have been concerns about the allegedly defective drywall manufactured in china and sold in the us we do not believe that we have had any exposure to such products because we purchase our drywall materials from domestic suppliers that have certified to us that their products were not manufactured in china 
consolidations  sales and divestitures we completed the divestitures of certain non core businesses in  including american hardwoods  inc american hardwoods and our aluminum extrusion operation 
results relating to these operations were reclassified to discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
the total pretax gain recognized on the sales of these operations was approximately million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
certain assets and the business of american hardwoods were sold in january for cash consideration of million 
results relating to this operation were previously reported in the distribution segment 
the building that housed the operation was subsequently sold in june for million 
proceeds from the sale of the building were used to pay down approximately million in long term debt 
in july  the company completed the sale of certain assets of its aluminum extrusion operation 
previously  the financial results of this operation had comprised the entire engineered solutions segment 
net cash proceeds of approximately million were used to pay down million of long term debt and reduce borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit by million 
certain operating facilities were closed or consolidated during to improve operating efficiencies in the plants through increased capacity utilization and to continue the company s efforts to reduce its leverage position 
in december  the company sold its operating facility located in ocala  florida 
approximately million of the net proceeds from the sale were used to pay down principal on the company s term loan 
in addition  a pretax gain on the sale of approximately million was recognized in the fourth quarter of through march   the company s owned facilities in woodburn  oregon and fontana  california were sold with approximately million of the net proceeds from the sales used to pay down principal on the company s term loan 
in addition  the company anticipates recording a pretax gain on the sales of approximately million in its first quarter operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
summary of financial results below is a summary of our financial results

in fiscal year  we proactively explored  initiated and completed a number of necessary cost reduction and efficiency improvement initiatives designed to reduce our leverage position  keep operating costs aligned with our revenue base  and keep our overhead structure at a level consistent with our operating needs given current economic conditions 
some of these initiatives are as follows completed the sale of american hardwoods and the aluminum extrusion operation closed consolidated facilities to improve operating efficiencies in our plants through increased capacity utilization  managed inventory costs by reducing supplier lead times and minimum order requirements  and by increasing inventory turns  further reduced workforce and production capacities to accommodate anticipated customer demand and maintain efficiencies  and managing our delivery costs through the reduction in our fleet size and consolidating our delivery loads

liquidity and capital resources cash flows operating activities cash flows from operations represent the net income or the net loss sustained in the reported periods adjusted for non cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
our principal uses of cash have been to support seasonal working capital demands  meet debt service requirements and support our capital expenditure plans

inventory cash flows in included an adjustment of million for the write down and disposal of slow moving inventories due to obsolescence and commodity market price declines and a million physical inventory adjustment at one of the company s manufacturing facilities 
in both and  the company focused on reducing inventory levels and managing inventory costs by closely following customer sales levels and reducing purchases correspondingly  while working together with key suppliers to reduce lead time and minimum quantity requirements 
the million net decrease to accounts payable and accrued liabilities in was due to a reduction in employee headcount  which drove lower payroll and benefit related accruals  and the discontinued operations being sold  which reduced accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million in compared to million in the year over year change in operating cash flow is primarily the result of lower net income in that was largely impacted by the deterioration of macroeconomic conditions that negatively impacted sales volumes in the rv  mh and residential housing markets and industries 
the net loss also included non cash impairment charges and inventory write downs of approximately million 
inventory decreased million reflecting a decline in customer inventory levels and an increased focus on managing working capital needs

the company used the proceeds from the rights offering to prepay approximately million of remaining principal under the senior subordinated promissory notes and to pay approximately million of related accrued interest  and used the remaining proceeds to reduce borrowings under its credit facility 
the company amended its credit agreement in march and modified certain financial covenants  terms and reporting requirements 
in december  the company entered into a second amendment and waiver the second amendment to its credit agreement 
the second amendment included both the addition and modification of certain definitions  terms and reporting requirements and amended the termination date of the credit agreement to expire on january  under the terms of the second amendment  the lenders waived any event of default as defined in the credit agreement that resulted from the company s failure to comply with the maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenants for the computation period ended september  the financial covenants were amended to eliminate the consolidated net worth  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio covenants  in lieu of new one month and two month minimum consolidated ebitda requirements and a million capital expenditures limitation for any fiscal year 
effective with the second amendment  the interest rates for borrowings under the revolving line of credit are the alternate base rate the abr plus  or the london interbank offer rate libor plus

the company has the option to defer payment of any interest on term loans in excess of pik interest until the term maturity date 
since january  the company has elected the pik interest option 
as a result  the principal amount outstanding under the term loan for the year ended december  was increased by approximately million to reflect pik interest 
for  pik interest is reflected as a non cash charge adjustment in operating cash flows under the caption interest paid in kind 
in addition  effective with the second amendment  the interest rates on the obligation were adjusted and the company determined that its two swap agreements were ineffective as hedges against changes in interest rates and  as a result  the swaps were de designated 
losses on the swaps included in other comprehensive income as of the de designation date are being amortized into net income loss over the life of the swaps utilizing the straight line method which approximates the effective interest method 
all future changes in the fair value of the de designated swaps will be recorded within earnings on the statements of operations 
for the years ended december  and  amortized losses of million and  respectively  were recognized in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
the de designation losses to be amortized to interest expense is expected to approximate million in in addition  the change in the fair value of the de designated swaps for the year ended december  resulted in a million reduction to interest expense and the corresponding liability

until such dates  there was no applicable minimum consolidated ebitda requirement 
c the definition of consolidated ebitda was amended to exclude the effects of losses and gains due to discontinued operations and restructuring charges  subject to approval of the administrative agent 
d the revolving commitments were reduced by million to a maximum of million 
e the monthly borrowing limits under the revolving commitments were reset in conjunction with projected monthly cash flows 
f the company agreed to provide an appraisal by a lender approved firm of each parcel of real estate owned by the company and its subsidiaries within days of the effectiveness of the third amendment 
based on the results of the appraisals  there was no indication of impairment for any of the real estate parcels 
g the receipt of net cash proceeds related to any asset disposition  other than proceeds attributable to inventory and receivables  will be used to pay down principal on the term loan 
effective with the third amendment  the minimum one and two month consolidated ebitda requirement is measured at the end of each month beginning with the fiscal months ended june  and july   respectively 
the maximum borrowing limit amount as defined in the second amendment was reduced from million to million 
the principal amount outstanding under the term loan at march  remained unchanged under the amended terms 
the interest rates for borrowings under the revolving line of credit and the term loan  and the expiration date of the credit agreement also remained unchanged 
consolidated ebitda is calculated pursuant to the credit agreement  whereby adjustments to reported ebitda include items such as i removing the effects of non cash gains and losses  non cash impairment charges  and certain non recurring items  ii adding back non cash stock compensation expenses  iii excluding the impact of certain closed operations  and iv excluding the effects of losses and gains due to discontinued operations and restructuring charges  subject to approval of the administrative agent 
the company has maintained compliance with the revised minimum one and two month consolidated ebitda requirements as modified in the third amendment 
there was no applicable minimum consolidated ebitda requirement for the fiscal month ended march  for the fiscal month ended june   the one month minimum consolidated ebitda was  versus actual consolidated ebitda of  for the fiscal month ended september   the one and two month minimum consolidated ebitda was  and  respectively  versus actual consolidated ebitda for the same periods of  and  respectively 
for the fiscal month ended december   the one and two month minimum consolidated ebitda was  and  respectively  versus actual consolidated ebitda for the same periods of  and  respectively 
on december   the company entered into a fourth amendment to the company credit agreement the fourth amendment 
the fourth amendment amended certain definitions  terms and reporting requirements to better align with the company s updated operating and cash flow projections for fiscal year pursuant to the fourth amendment  the financial covenants were modified to establish new quarterly minimum ebitda requirements that will replace the existing minimum one month and two month requirements beginning with the fiscal quarter ended march  in addition  the monthly borrowing limits under the revolving commitments were reset in conjunction with updated projected monthly cash flows for effective with the fourth amendment  borrowings under the revolving line of credit are subject to a borrowing base  up to a maximum borrowing limit of million for fiscal year the interest rates for borrowings under the revolving line of credit and the term loan  and the expiration date of the credit agreement remained unchanged 
the company s ability to access these borrowings is subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility including the financial covenants 
during  the company paid down million in principal on its senior notes  and paid million in principal on outstanding bonds 
see discussion below 
in addition  borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit were reduced by million in summary of liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to meet seasonal working capital demands  meet debt service requirements  and support our capital expenditure plans 
we also have a substantial asset collateral base  which we believe if sold in the normal course  is more than sufficient to cover our outstanding senior debt 
we obtain additional liquidity through selling our products and collecting receivables 
we use the funds collected to pay creditors and employees and to fund working capital needs 
the company has another source of cash through the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our current credit facility and life insurance policies will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditure programs as currently contemplated 
our current credit facility allows us to borrow funds based on certain percentages of accounts receivable of eligible accounts and inventories of eligible inventory  less outstanding letters of credit 
we are subject to market risk primarily in relation to our cash and short term investments 
the interest rate we may earn on the cash we invest in short term investments is subject to market fluctuations 
while we attempt to minimize market risk and maximize return  changes in market conditions may significantly affect the income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  a portion of our debt obligations under our credit facility are currently subject to variable rates of interest based on libor 
cash  cash equivalents  and borrowings available under our credit facility are expected to be sufficient to finance the known and or foreseeable liquidity and capital needs of the company for at least the next months 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes related to the rv and mh industries  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
in the event that our operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would seek to revise our operating strategies accordingly 
we expect to maintain compliance with the revised minimum quarterly consolidated ebitda covenant  as modified in the fourth amendment  based on the company s operating plan  notwithstanding continued uncertain and volatile market conditions 
management has also identified other actions within its control that could be implemented  if necessary  to help the company reduce its leverage position 
these actions include the exploration of asset sales  divestitures and other types of capital raising alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful or generate cash resources adequate to retire or sufficiently reduce the company s indebtedness under the credit agreement prior to its expiration 
our credit facility is scheduled to expire on january  we currently have the intent and we believe we have the ability to refinance during however  we do not believe we will be able to consummate this refinancing by the time we issue our balance sheet for the first quarter of in order to classify our outstanding indebtedness as a long term liability beginning with the first quarter of  the following two criteria are required the company must have the intent to refinance  and the company must have the ability to consummate the refinancing 
the ability to consummate the refinancing can be satisfied by either a the issuance of a long term obligation after the date of the company s balance sheet but before that balance sheet is issued  or b entrance into a financing agreement before the balance sheet is issued that clearly permits it to refinance the short term obligation on a long term basis on terms that are readily determinable  and certain conditions are being satisfied 
based on the above criteria  our outstanding long term indebtedness as of march  first fiscal quarter end is expected to be reclassified as a short term liability until such time as the refinancing of our credit facility is completed 
if we fail to comply with the covenants under our amended credit agreement  there can be no assurance that a majority of the lenders that are party to our credit agreement will consent to a further amendment of the credit agreement 
in this event  the lenders could cause the related indebtedness to become due and payable prior to maturity or it could result in the company having to refinance this indebtedness under unfavorable terms 
if our debt were accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full should they be required to be sold outside of the normal course of business  such as through forced liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings 
further  if current unfavorable credit market conditions were to persist throughout the remainder of  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the future periods during which we expect to settle these obligations 
we have provided additional details about some of these obligations in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
thousands payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total revolving line of credit long term debt interest payments on debt deferred compensation payments facility leases equipment leases total contractual cash obligations the estimated long term debt payment of million in includes million of payments based on scheduled debt service requirements 
in addition  the company used the net proceeds from the sales of two buildings classified as available for sale at december  to prepay approximately million in principal on the company s term loan through march  scheduled interest payments on debt are calculated based on interest rates in effect at december  as follows a revolving line of credit  b term loan including pik interest of  and c north carolina revenue bonds 
we also have commercial commitments as described below in thousands other commercial commitments total amount committed outstanding at date of expiration revolving credit agreement january  letters of credit january  off balance sheet arrangements other than the commercial commitments set forth above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u 
s requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
other significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments trade receivables 
we are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and material for use primarily by the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries and other industrial markets 
trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we control credit risk related to our trade receivables through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures  and perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
in assessing the carrying value of its trade receivables  the company estimates the recoverability by making assumptions based on our historical write off and collection experience and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio 
a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the future if a customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than the company s historical experience 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company does not accrue interest on any of its trade receivables 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  the allowance for doubtful accounts was decreased by million to million at december  compared to million for in  the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased by million to million compared to  for to reflect certain customers of the company that had closed or filed bankruptcy 
there were no material changes made to the allowance in inventories 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for inventory obsolescence of million and million was established at december  and  respectively 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
the company decreased its reserve for obsolescence by million at december  from million at december  reflecting a continued focus on managing inventory to levels more consistent with demand in order to maximize liquidity 
during  depressed market conditions and commodity market price declines contributed to a significant decrease in product demand 
as a result  the company increased its reserve for obsolescence by million to million at december  from million at december  to reflect inventory dedicated to certain customers who had filed bankruptcy 
in  the reserve was increased to million from  in the prior year primarily to reflect changes in customer demand 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the rv or mh industries  and or a loss of a major customer or several customers 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and forecasts 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
a change in the company s business climate in  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  led to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  which subsequently resulted in an impairment charge of million related to machinery and equipment which is included in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of operations 
no events or changes in circumstances occurred that required the company to assess the recoverability of its property and equipment for the years ended december  and  and therefore the company has not recognized any impairment charges for those years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the impairment charge in all of the company s goodwill and long lived asset impairment assessments are based on established fair value techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis 
these analyses require management to estimate both future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the current business model 
the assumptions supporting valuation models  including discount rates  are determined using the best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty  and differences in actual future results may require further impairment charges  which may be significant 
impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included goodwill and other intangible assets and has made a purchase subsequent to the balance sheet date which included goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
we perform the required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or more frequently if conditions warrant 
for purposes of the goodwill impairment test  the reporting units of the company are utilized 
the impairment tests performed by the company are based on estimates of the fair value of the company s reporting units 
the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  and or a significant decrease in the market value of the company s discounted cash flows could result in an impairment charge 
the impairment calculation compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill and intangible assets with the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
finite lived intangible assets that meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also subject to an impairment test based on estimated undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist  similar to other long lived assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements sets out the impact of million of charges taken in to recognize the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and the factors which led to changes in estimates and assumptions 
significant assumptions used in our step one discounted cash flow analysis for the reporting units included a five year compound average growth rate cagr of  weighted average cost of capital of  and a terminal value growth rate of 
deferred income taxes 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these deferred tax assets 
if these assumptions change  the company may be required to record valuation allowances against its gross deferred tax assets  which would cause the company to record additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
management evaluates the potential the company will be able to realize its gross deferred tax assets and assesses the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
the company recorded an million valuation allowance in and increased the allowance by million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details

inflation the prices of key raw materials  consisting primarily of lauan  gypsum  and particleboard are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities  such as the price of oil  rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
during periods of rising commodity prices  we have generally been able to pass the increased costs to our customers in the form of surcharges and price increases 
we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on results of operations for the periods presented
