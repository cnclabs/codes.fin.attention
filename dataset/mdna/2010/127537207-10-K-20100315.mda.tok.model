item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in february  we released new details of a comprehensive year long study measuring the vast scale and recharge rate of the cadiz aquifer system 
the study was conducted by internationally recognized environmental consulting firm chm hill at the project area utilizing new models produced by the us geological survey in and chm hill and additional hydrology experts that have peer reviewed the work confirmed the aquifer system can sustainably support the cadiz project 
major findings of the report include the groundwater in storage in the alluvial aquifer ranges from to million acre feet  the character of the underlying carbonate units greatly contribute to the productivity of the groundwater basin and would substantially add to the quantity of water stored in the alluvial aquifer system  application of the latest usgs computer model results in a recharge estimate of  acre feet per year  much higher than the previous usgs maxey eakin model estimates of  to  acre feet per year  and a significant groundwater resource generated by precipitation in the watershed is presently being wasted to evaporation at the bristol and cadiz dry lakes 
with the hydrological studies complete  we will now proceed with the environmental review of the project jointly with our public agency partners 
b financial information about industry segments our primary business is to acquire and develop land and water resources 
our agricultural operations are confined to limited farming activities at the cadiz valley property 
as a result  our financial results are reported in a single segment 
see consolidated financial statements

c narrative description of business our business strategy is the development of our landholdings for their highest and best uses 
at present  our development activities are focused on water resource  agricultural and renewable energy development 
water resource development our portfolio of water resources is located in proximity to the colorado river and the colorado river aqueduct cra  the principal source of imported water for southern california  and provides us with the opportunity to participate in a variety of water storage and supply programs  exchanges  and conservation programs with public agencies and other partners 
the cadiz water conservation and storage project we own approximately  acres of land and the subsurface strata  inclusive of the unsaturated soils and appurtenant water rights in the cadiz and fenner valleys of eastern san bernardino county the cadiz property 
the aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation both rain and snow within a watershed of approximately  square miles 
see item  properties the cadiz fenner valley property 
the cadiz water conservation and storage project the cadiz project would provide southern california with a valuable increase in water supply during periods of drought or other emergencies 
the cadiz project is a comprehensive conjunctive use and water conservation program that provides for the managed and scheduled withdrawal of groundwater and imported water from the aquifer system that underlies the cadiz property to optimize efficient use and avoid waste 
cadiz project facilities would include  among other things spreading basins  which are shallow settling ponds that will be configured to efficiently percolate water from the ground surface down to the water table using subsurface storage capacity for the storage of water and minimize evaporative loss versus surface storage facilities  high yield wells designed to efficiently recover available native groundwater and stored colorado river water from beneath the cadiz project area  a mile conveyance pipeline to connect the spreading basins and well field to the cra  a pumping plant to pump water through the conveyance pipeline from the cra to the cadiz project spreading basins  and energy for the project is expected to be supplied by solar power 
other eastern mojave properties our second largest landholding is approximately  acres in the piute valley of eastern san bernardino county 
this landholding is located approximately miles from the resort community of laughlin  nevada  and about miles from the colorado river town of needles  california 
extensive hydrological studies  including the drilling and testing of a full scale production well  have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high quality groundwater 
the aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation both rain and snow within a watershed of approximately square miles 
discussions with potential partners with the objective of developing our piute valley assets are ongoing 
additionally  we own acreage located near danby dry lake  approximately miles southeast of our landholdings in the cadiz and fenner valleys 
the danby lake property is located approximately miles north of the cra 
initial hydrological studies indicate that it has excellent potential for an aquifer storage  recovery and supply project 
agricultural development within the cadiz valley property   acres have been zoned for agriculture 
the infrastructure includes seven wells that are interconnected within this acreage  with total annual production capacity of approximately  acre feet of water 
additionally  there are housing and kitchen facilities that support up to employees 
the underlying groundwater  fertile soil  and desert temperatures are well suited for a wide variety of fruits and vegetables 
permanent crops currently in production include acres of certified organic vineyards and acres of lemons 
both of these crops are farmed using sustainable agricultural practices 
additionally  in january  we entered into an agreement with a third party to develop up to another acres of lemons 
seasonal vegetable crops are all grown organically and plantings are expected to include squash and beans 
renewable energy and other development opportunities in addition to the projects described above  we believe our landholdings are suitable for other types of development  including solar energy generation 
both federal and state initiatives support alternative energy facilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of imported fossil fuels 
the locations  topography  and proximity of our properties to utility corridors are well suited for solar energy generation and transmission 
an additional advantage we can offer is the availability of the water supply needed by solar thermal power plant designs 
we are engaged in on going discussions with energy companies interested in utilizing our landholdings for various types of solar energy development 
over the longer term  we believe that population growth in nearby desert communities in southern california  nevada and arizona will resume and that  in time  the economics of commercial and residential development on our properties will also become attractive 
we remain committed to our land and water assets and will continue to explore all opportunities for development of these assets 
we cannot predict with certainty which of these development initiatives will ultimately be realized 
seasonality our water resource development activities are not seasonal in nature 
our farming operations are limited to the cultivation of lemons and grapes raisins and spring and fall plantings of vegetables on the cadiz valley properties 
these operations are subject to the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry 
competition we face competition for the acquisition  development and sale of our properties from a number of competitors 
we may also face competition in the development of water resources and siting of renewable energy facilities associated with our properties 
since california has scarce water resources and an increasing demand for available water  we believe that location  price and reliability of delivery are the principal competitive factors affecting transfers of water in california 
employees as of december   we employed full time employees ie those individuals working more than  hours per year 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
regulation our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local laws and regulations 
as we proceed with the development of our properties  including the cadiz project  we will be required to satisfy various regulatory authorities that we are in compliance with the laws  regulations and policies enforced by such authorities 
groundwater development  and the export of surplus groundwater for sale to entities such as public water agencies  is subject to regulation by specific existing statutes  in addition to general environmental statutes applicable to all development projects 
additionally  we must obtain a variety of approvals and permits from state and federal governments with respect to issues that may include environmental issues  issues related to special status spec ies  issues related to the public trust  and others 
because of the discretionary nature of these approvals and concerns which may be raised by various governmental officials  public interest groups and other interested parties during both the development and the approval process  our ability to develop properties and realize income from its projects  including the cadiz project  could be delayed  reduced or eliminated

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks  including those described below 
our development activities have not generated significant revenues at present  our activities are focused on water resource  agricultural  and renewable energy development at our san bernardino county properties 
we have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date and we do not know when  if ever  we will receive operating revenues sufficient to offset the costs of our development activities 
as a result  we continue to incur a net loss from operations 
we may never generate significant revenues or become profitable unless we are able to successfully implement programs to develop our land assets and related water resources we do not know the terms  if any  upon which we may be able to proceed with our water and other development programs 
regardless of the form of our water development programs  the circumstances under which transfers or storage of water can be made and the profitability of any transfers or storage are subject to significant uncertainties  including the risk of variable water supplies and changing water allocation priorities 
additional risks include our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and permits  possible litigation by environmental or other groups  unforeseen technical difficulties  general market conditions for real estate and water supplies  and the time needed to generate significant operating revenues from such progra ms after operations commence 
the development of our properties is heavily regulated  requires governmental approvals and permits that could be denied  and may have competing governmental interests and objectives in developing our land assets and related water resources  we are subject to local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  resource protection  environmental impacts  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  construction and similar matters 
our development activities are subject to the risk of adverse interpretations or changes to us federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies 
further  our development activities require governmental approvals and permits that  if denied or granted subject to unfavorable conditions or restrictions  would adversely impact our ability to successfully implement our development programs 
the opposition of government officials may adversely affect our ability to obtain needed government approvals and permits upon satisfactory terms in a timely manner 
in this regard  federal government appropriations currently preclude spending for any proposal to store water for the purpose of export or for any activities associated with the approval of rights of way on lands managed by the needles field office of the bureau of land management 
as a result of a new right of way with the arizona california railroad company  we do not believe federal approval will be required to implement the cadiz project  however  even this may be subject to similar challenges 
a significant portion of our cadiz valley property is included in a study area as part of the environmental impact statement eis process for the expansion of the marine corp air ground combat center in twentynine palms  california 
our property is included in one of the five different alternatives that will be studied for the base expansion during the eis process over the next three years 
if any of the cadiz valley landholdings are included in the final expansion area  then we will be entitled to full fair market value compensation for any property taken 
additionally  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge proposed plans and approvals 
in california  third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
opposition from environmental groups could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects  certain groups may remain opposed to our development plans 
our failure to make timely payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness may result in a foreclosure on our assets as of december   we had indebtedness outstanding to our senior secured lenders of approximately million 
our assets have been put up as collateral for this debt 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to make principal and interest payments on this indebtedness when due  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness  we may default on our obligations 
if we default on our obligations  our lenders may sell off the assets that we have put up as collateral 
this  in turn  would result in a cessation or sale of our operations 
the conversion of our outstanding senior indebtedness into common stock would dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders our senior indebtedness is convertible into common stock at the election of our lenders 
as of december   our senior indebtedness was convertible into  shares of our common stock  an amount equal to approximately of the number of fully diluted shares of our common stock outstanding as of that date 
an election by our lenders to convert all or a portion of our senior secured indebtedness into common stock will dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders 
we may not be able to obtain the financing we need to implement our asset development programs based upon our current and anticipated usage of cash resources  we have sufficient funds to meet our expected working capital needs through fiscal year we will continue to require additional working capital to meet our cash resource needs from that point forward and to continue to finance our operations until such time as our asset development programs produce revenues 
if we cannot raise needed funds  we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses  which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company 
we cannot assure you that our current lenders  or any other lenders  will give us additional credit should we seek it 
if we are unable to obtain additional credit  we may engage in further equity financings 
our ability to obtain equity financing will depend  among other things  on the status of our asset development programs and general conditions in the capital markets at the time funding is sought 
although we currently expect our capital sources to be sufficient to meet our near term liquidity needs  there can be no assurance that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied 
any further equity financings would result in the dilution of ownership interests of our current stockholders 
the issuance of equity securities under management equity incentive plans will impact earnings our compensation programs for management emphasize long term incentives  primarily through the issuance of equity securities and options to purchase equity securities 
it is expected that plans involving the issuance of shares  options  or both will be submitted from time to time to our stockholders for approval 
in the event that any such plans are approved and implemented  the issuance of shares and options under such plans may result in the dilution of the ownership interest of other stockholders and will  under currently applicable accounting rules  result in a charge to earnings based on the value of our common stock at the time of issue and the fair value of options at the time of their award 
the expense would be recorded ove r the vesting period of each stock and option grant

unresolved staff comments not applicable at this time 
item properties following is a description of our significant properties 
the cadiz fenner valley property since  we have acquired approximately  acres of largely contiguous land in the cadiz and fenner valleys of eastern san bernardino county  california 
this area is located approximately miles north of the colorado river aqueduct 
in  we conducted investigations of the feasibility of agricultural development of this land 
these investigations confirmed the availability of high quality groundwater in quantities appropriate for agricultural development 
additional independent geotechnical and engineering studies conducted since have confirmed that the cadiz fenner property overlies an aquifer system that is ideally suited for aquifer storage and use of indigenous groundwater  as contemplated in the cadiz project 
see item  business narrative description of business water resource development 
in november  the san bernardino county board of supervisors unanimously approved a general plan amendment establishing an agricultural land use designation for  acres in the cadiz valley 
this action also allows for the withdrawal of more than  acre feet of groundwater from the aquifer system underlying our property 
in february  we released new details of a comprehensive year long study measuring the vast scale and recharge rate of the cadiz aquifer system 
the study was conducted by internationally recognized environmental consulting firm chm hill at the project area utilizing new models produced by the us geological survey in and chm hill and additional hydrology experts that have peer reviewed the work confirmed the aquifer system can sustainably support the cadiz project 
other eastern mojave properties we also own approximately  additional acres in the eastern mojave desert  including the piute and danby lake properties

executive offices we lease approximately  square feet of office space in los angeles  california for our executive offices 
the lease terminates in october current base rent under the lease is approximately  per month 
cadiz real estate in december  we transferred substantially all of our assets with the exception of our office sublease  certain office furniture and equipment and any sun world related assets to cadiz real estate llc  a delaware limited liability company cadiz real estate 
we hold of the equity interests of cadiz real estate  and therefore we continue to hold beneficial ownership of the properties that we transferred to cadiz real estate 
cadiz real estate was created at the behest of our then existing senior secured lender  ing capital llc ing 
the board of managers of cadiz real estate currently consists of two managers appointed by us 
cadiz real estate is a co obligor under our senior secured convertible term loan  for which assets of cadiz real estate have been pledged as security 
because the transfer of our properties to cadiz real estate has no effect on our ultimate beneficial ownership of these properties  we refer throughout this report to properties owned of record either by cadiz real estate or by us as our properties

forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as intends  anticipates  believes  estimates  projects  forecasts  expects  plans and proposes 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements 
these include  among others  our ability to maximize value from our land and water resources and our ability to obtain new financings as needed to meet our ongoing working capital needs 
see additional discussion under the heading risk factors above 
overview our operations and  accordingly  our working capital requirements relate primarily to our water  agricultural  and renewable energy development activities 
our primary asset consists of  acres of land in three areas of eastern san bernardino county  california 
virtually all of this land is underlain by high quality groundwater resources that are suitable for a variety of uses  including water storage and supply programs 
the advantages of underground water storage relative to surface storage include minimal surface environmental impacts  low capital investment  and minimal evaporative water loss 
the properties are located in proximity to the colorado river and the colorado river aqueduct  the major source of imported water for southern california 
the value of these assets derives from a combination of increasing pressure on water and renewable energy supplies in california 
california is presently facing a dire water crisis 
water agencies throughout california imposed mandatory rationing in in order to meet anticipated demand 
additionally  through a series of policy initiatives  the state of california and the united states government have issued compelling calls for increased renewable energy production in order to meet future national energy needs 
this includes california s mandate to acquire of the state s electricity from renewable sources by as a result  we believe that a competitive advantage exists for companies that can provide high quality  reliable  and affordable water to major population centers as well as for companies that can site renewable energy facilities 
our objective is to realize the highest and best use for these assets in an environmentally responsible way 
we believe this can best be achieved through a combination of water supply and storage programs  sustainable agricultural development and the production of renewable energy at our properties 
water resource development in  we secured permits for up to  acres of agricultural development in the cadiz valley and the withdrawal of more than one million acre feet of groundwater from the underlying aquifer system 
once the agricultural development was underway  we also established that the location  geology and hydrology of this property is uniquely suited for both agricultural development and the development of an aquifer storage  recovery  and dry year supply project to augment the water supplies available to southern california 
in  we entered into the first of a series of agreements with the metropolitan water district of southern california metropolitan to jointly design  permit and build such a project the cadiz project or project 
in general  several elements are needed to complete the development federal and state environmental permits  a pipeline right of way from the colorado river aqueduct to the project area  a storage and supply agreement with one or more public water agencies or private water utilities  and construction and working capital financing 
between and  we and metropolitan received substantially all of the state and federal approvals required for the permits necessary to construct and operate the project  including a record of decision rod from the us department of the interior  which endorsed the cadiz project and offered a right of way for construction of project facilities 
the rod also approved a final environmental impact statement feis in compliance with the national environmental policy act nepa 
in october  metropolitan s staff brought the right of way matter before the metropolitan board of directors 
by a very narrow margin  the metropolitan board voted not to accept the right of way grant and not to proceed with the project 
in april  we filed a claim against metropolitan seeking compensatory damages 
when settlement negotiations failed to produce a resolution  we filed a lawsuit against metropolitan in los angeles superior court on november   seeking compensatory damages for a breach of various contractual and fiduciary obligations to us  and interference with the economic advantage we would have obtained from the cadiz project 
on february   we and metropolitan agreed to settle our differences and dismissed all outstanding claims remaining against each other 
in september  we secured a new right of way for the project s water conveyance pipeline by entering into a lease agreement with the arizona california railroad company 
the agreement allows cadiz to utilize a portion of the railroad s right of way for the cadiz project water conveyance pipeline for a period up to years 
in may  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the natural heritage institute nhi a leading global environmental organization committed to protecting aquatic ecosystem  to assist with our efforts to sustainably manage the development of our cadiz valley property 
as part of this green compact we will follow stringent plans for groundwater management and habitat conservation and create a groundwater management plan for the project 
in june  we executed letters of intent loi with five southern california water providers 
as part of the lois  cadiz and the water providers will develop a cost sharing agreement  finalize terms of pricing  design and capital allocation and work towards implementation of the project 
these providers serve more than three million customers in california s san bernardino  riverside  los angeles  orange and ventura counties 
we expect to add additional participants for other aspects of the project as the environmental review proceeds 
in february  we released new details of a comprehensive year long study measuring the vast scale and recharge rate of the cadiz aquifer system 
the study was conducted by internationally recognized environmental consulting firm chm hill at the project area utilizing new models produced by the us geological survey in and chm hill and additional hydrology experts that have peer reviewed the work confirmed the aquifer system can sustainably support the cadiz project 
with the hydrological studies complete  we will now proceed with the environmental review of the project 
agricultural development within the cadiz valley property   acres have been zoned for agriculture 
the infrastructure includes seven wells that are interconnected within this acreage  with total annual production capacity of approximately  acre feet of water 
additionally  there are housing and kitchen facilities that support up to employees 
the underlying groundwater  fertile soil  and desert temperatures are well suited for a wide variety of fruits and vegetables 
permanent crops currently in production include acres of certified organic vineyards and acres of lemons 
both of these crops are farmed using sustainable agricultural practices 
additionally  we entered into an agreement with a third party to develop up to another acres of lemons 
seasonal vegetable crops are all grown organically and plantings are expected to include squash and beans 
other development opportunities in addition to the development projects described above  we believe that our landholdings are suitable for other types of development  including solar energy generation 
both federal and state initiatives support alternative energy facilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of imported fossil fuels 
the locations  topography  and proximity of our properties to utility corridors are well suited for solar energy generation and transmission 
an additional advantage we can offer is the availability of the water supply needed by solar thermal power plant designs 
we are presently in discussions with energy companies interested in utilizing our landholdings for various types of solar energy development 
over the longer term  we believe that the population of southern california  nevada  and arizona will continue to grow  and that  in time  the economics of commercial and residential development of our properties will become attractive 
we remain committed to our land and water assets and we continue to explore all opportunities for development of these assets 
we cannot predict with certainty which of these various opportunities will ultimately be utilized 
results of operations a year ended december  compared to year ended december we have not received significant revenues from our water resource and real estate development activity to date 
as a result  we continue to incur a net loss from operations 
we had revenues of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue is primarily due to a smaller raisin and lemon harvest in in comparison to the net loss totaled million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  the larger loss in resulted primarily from higher non cash expenses related to stock and option awards  and expenses related to our lawsuit against the metropolitan water district of southern california that was settled in the first quarter of our primary expenses are our ongoing overhead costs ie general and administrative expense and our interest expense 
we will continue to incur non cash expenses in connection with our management and director equity incentive compensation plans 
revenues 
revenue totaled million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease in revenue is primarily due to a smaller raisin and lemon harvest in in comparison to revenues included million of revenues related to citrus crop sales  which were down million from the prior year  and million of revenues r elated to raisin sales  which were down million from the prior year

net interest expense totaled million during the year ended december   compared to million during the following table summarizes the components of net interest expense for the two periods in thousands year ended december  interest on outstanding debt amortization of debt discount amortization of deferred loan costs interest income the interest on outstanding debt increased from million to million due to the increase in interest rate from to per annum on the senior secured convertible term loan  while the amortization of debt discount decreased from million to million due to extension of the accretion schedule related to the conversion option embedded in the term loan 
interest income decreased to thousand from thousand in the prior year due to lower short term interest rates and a more conservative investment policy 
debt refinancing 
deferred loan costs  which are primarily legal fees  are amortized over the life of each loan agreement 
in june  we refinanced our term loan with ing capital llc ing with a new senior secured convertible term loan with a different lender 
as a result   of legal fees were capitalized and will be amortized over the year life of the loan agreement 
in june  the conversion feature of the term loan was modified 
as a result of the modification of the convertible debt arrangement  the change in conversion value between the original and modified instrument was approximately million  which was recorded as an additional debt discount 
such debt discount is accreted to the redemption value of the instrument over the remaining term of the loan as additional interest expense 
b year ended december  compared to year ended december we had revenues of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the higher revenues were due to a larger lemon and raisin harvest 
the net loss totaled million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  the larger loss in resulted primarily from additional net interest expense of million and additional amortization expense related to stock based compensation of million

we had no other income expense in the year ended december   compared with  of losses on the disposition of assets during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources a current financing arrangements as we have not received significant revenues from our water resource  agricultural and renewable energy development activity to date  we have been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource and other development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence 
historically  we have addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements  private equity placements and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants 
we have worked with our secured lenders to structure our debt in a way which allows us to continue development of the cadiz project and minimize the dilution of the ownership interests of common stockholders 
in june  we entered into a new million five year zero coupon senior secured convertible term loan with peloton partners llp through an affiliate and another lender the term loan 
on april   we were advised that peloton had assigned its interest in the term loan to an affiliate of lampe conway company llc lampe conway  and lampe conway subsequently replaced peloton as administrative agent of the loan 
on june   we completed arrangements to amend the term loan 
the significant terms of the amendment are as follows maturity date was extended from june   to june   interest will continue to accrue at per annum through maturity  the conversion feature has been modified to allow up to million of principal to be converted into  shares of cadiz common stock initial conversion portion at a conversion price of per share  and the remaining principal and interest to be converted into shares of cadiz common stock at a conversion price of per share 
if fully converted at june   this would result in cadiz common stock being issued at an average conversion price of per share  and we now have the right at any time prior to june  to prepay the loan s outstanding principal other than as to the initial conversion portion plus all accrued interest in full without penalty  and may at the same time prepay the initial conversion portion either in stock at a conversion premium or  at the election of the lenders  in cash with an equal value but not less than million 
the term loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company  which contains representations  warranties and covenants that are typical for agreements of this type  including restrictions that would limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  pay dividends or make restricted payments  dispose of assets  make investments and merge or consolidate with another person 
however  while there are affirmative covenants  there are no financial maintenance covenants and no restrictions on the company s ability to issue additional common stock to fund future working capital needs 
as a result of the modification of the convertible debt arrangement  the change in conversion value between the original and modified instrument of approximately million was recorded as an additional debt discount 
such debt discount is accreted to the redemption value of the instrument over the remaining term of the loan as additional interest expense 
the debt covenants associated with the loan were negotiated by the parties with a view towards our operating and financial condition as it existed at the time the agreements were executed 
at december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants 
a private placement which we completed in november   included the issuance of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
during  holders of  of the warrants exercised their warrants  resulting in our issuance of  shares of common stock with net proceeds of  in january  we exercised our right to terminate all unexercised warrants on march   subject to a day notice period 
in response  holders of all  warrants then outstanding exercised their warrants during february as a result  we issued  shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of  following th ese exercises  no warrants from this private placement remain outstanding 
in november and december of  we completed a private placement of  units at the price of per unit for proceeds of  each unit consists of three shares of our common stock and two common stock purchase warrants 
the first warrant entitled the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on november   the exercise price of this callable warrant was temporarily reduced to per share 
in response  holders of  warrants exercised their warrants  resulting in our issuance of  shares of common stock with net proceeds of  the remaining  warrants were cancelled 
the second warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
this warrant has a term of three years and is not callable by us 
in october  the company raised million with a private placement of  units at per unit 
this includes  units purchased by the lenders of the term loan pursuant to the lenders participation rights under the term loan 
each unit consists of three shares of the company s common stock and one stock purchase warrant 
the warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant has a term of three years  but is callable by the company at any time following november   if the closing market price of the company s common stock exceeds for consecutive trading days 
as we continue to actively pursue our business strategy  additional financing will be required 
see outlook  below 
the covenants in the term loan do not prohibit our use of additional equity financing and allow us to retain of the proceeds of any equity financing 
we do not expect the loan covenants to materially limit our ability to finance our water development activities 
at december   we had no outstanding credit facilities other than the convertible term loan 
cash used for operating activities 
cash used for operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the cash was primarily used to fund general and administrative expenses related to our water development efforts 
cash provided by used for investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december   was million  compared with million of cash used for investing activities during the same period in the period included million of short term deposits that matured  which were not considered cash equivalents in cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the cash provided included million of proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock at per share upon exercise of outstanding warrants  and million of proceeds from a private placement 
the result reflects million of proceeds from a private placement 
see current financing arrangements above 
b outlook short term outlook 
the million in proceeds from our october and november private placement  along with the million in proceeds from the warrant exercise  provides us with sufficient funds to meet our expected working capital needs for the next months 
within the next months we will need to identify financing for our working capital needs 
based on our current and anticipated usage of cash resources  we will continue to require additional working capital to meet our cash resource needs until such time as our asset development programs produce revenue 
if we are unable to generate this from our current development activities  then we w ill need to seek additional equity financing in the capital markets 
we expect to continue our historical practice of structuring our financing arrangements to match the anticipated needs of our development activities 
see long term outlook  below 
no assurances can be given  however  as to the availability or terms of any new financing 
long term outlook 
in the longer term  we will need to raise additional capital to finance working capital needs  capital expenditures and any payments due under our senior secured convertible term loan at maturity 
see current financing arrangements above 
payments will be due under the term loan only to the extent that lenders elect not to exercise equity conversion rights prior to the loan s final maturity date 
our future working capital needs will depend upon the specific measures we pursue in the entitlement and development of our water resources and other development 
future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the progress of the cadiz project 
we will evaluate the amount of cash needed  and the manner in which such cash will be raised  on an ongoing basis 
we may meet any future cash requirements through a variety of means  including equity or debt placements  or through the sale or other disposition of assets 
equity placements would be undertaken only to the extent necessary  so as to minimize the dilutive effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders 
limitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us 
sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities 
however  liquidity in the currently dislocated capital markets has been severely constrained since the beginning of the credit crisis 
although we currently expect our sources of capital to be sufficient to meet our near term liquidity needs  there can be no assurance that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfie d 
if the company cannot raise needed funds  it might be forced to make substantial reductions in its operating expenses  which could adversely affect its ability to implement its current business plan and ultimately its viability as a company 
c critical accounting policies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements of cadiz  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements based on all relevant information available at the time and giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these polici es involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
management has concluded that the following critical accounting policies described below affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
intangible and other long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company reevaluates the carrying value of its water program annually and has confirmed that the carrying value of the water program is not impaired as of december  goodwill 
as a result of a merger in may between two companies  which eventually became known as cadiz inc  goodwill in the amount of  was recorded 
approximately  of this amount was amortized until the adoption of accounting standards codification  intangibles goodwill and other asc on january  goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or if events occur which require an impairment analysis be performed 
the company has confirmed that the carrying value of the goodwill is not impaired as of december  deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
to date  the company has not generated significant revenue from its water development programs  and it has a history of net operating losses 
as such  the company has generated significant deferred tax assets  including large net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income taxes for which it has recorded a full valuation allowance 
management is currently working on water and real estate development projects  including the cadiz project  that are designed to generate future taxable income  although there can be no guarantee that this will occur 
if taxable income is generated in future years  some portion or all of the va luation allowance will be reversed  and an increase in net income would consequently be reported
