item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacture and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  industrial  military  medical  and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of two segments the manufacture and distribution of displays and display components display segment and the wholesale distribution of consumer electronic parts from foreign and domestic manufacturers wholesale distribution segment 
the display segment is organized into four interrelated operations aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to the aggregation criteria of fasb asc topic segment reporting monitors offers a wide range of crt  flat panel and projection display systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical  and industrial applications 
data display crts offers a wide range of crts for use in data display screens  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
entertainment crts offers a wide range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
component parts provides replacement electron guns and other components for crts primarily for servicing the company s internal needs 
the wholesale distribution segment is made up of parts distribution for electronic parts manufacturers and a call center for small appliance manufacturers 
during fiscal  management of the company focused key resources on strategic efforts to dispose of unprofitable operations seek acquisition opportunities that enhance the profitability and sales growth of the company s more profitable product lines 
in addition  the company continues to seek new products through acquisitions and internal development that complement existing profitable product lines 
challenges facing the company during these efforts include inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crts and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
the company s inventory turnover averages over days  although in many cases the company would anticipate holding to days of inventory in the normal course of operations 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors because it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining and  as manufacturers for these products discontinue production or exit the business  the company may make last time buys 
in the monitor operations of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers or accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to its vendors 
the company s management monitors the adequacy of its inventory reserves regularly  and at february   believes its reserves to be adequate 
interest rate exposure the company had outstanding debt of approximately million and million as of february  and  respectively  which is subject to interest rate fluctuations by the company s lenders 
variable interest rates on the company s loans and the potential for rate hikes could negatively affect the company s future earnings 
it is the intent of the company to continually 
table of contents monitor interest rates and consider converting portions of the company s debt from floating rates to fixed rates should conditions be favorable for such interest rate swaps or hedges 
operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues amounts in thousands see item business description of principal business and principal products for discussion about the company s products and divisions

amount amount net sales display segment monitors data display crts entertainment crts component parts total display segment wholesale distribution segment costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling and delivery general and administrative income from operations interest expense other income  net income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal display segment sales were flat at million for fiscal  and for fiscal wholesale distribution segment sales decreased or million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the display segment sales for fiscal had a general shift away from being a crt company to being a video display solutions company as the market for crts declines and moves to newer technologies 
the segment s business is more concentrated in the monitor division of the segment where all the new growth is occurring 
the monitor revenues increased million primarily due to contracts that began in the fourth quarter by the aydin and display systems facilities offset by lexel and z axis facilities  which saw a decline for the year 
data display crt sales in fiscal declined due to a decreased demand by the division s smaller customers  sales with the larger customers were flat 
entertainment crt net sales declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal a significant portion of the entertainment division s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to the continued shift to flat screen televisions  the market for replacement crts has diminished 
the company remains the primary supplier of product to meet manufacturers standard warranties 
future sales trends in this division will be negatively impacted by the decreasing number of extended warranties sold for larger  more expensive sets 
because the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and  accordingly  has reduced its inventory for these types of crts 
components parts sales decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal component parts sales have generally declined in recent years due to weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales 
component parts sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined over the past few years as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
this business will continue to decline as the television industry moves to the new technologies 
the division primarily supplies the other divisions with parts they need to complete the assembly of their products 
wholesale distribution segment net sales decline is attributed to a decline in the overall economy  particularly the consumer market  and a decision by management to focus on more profitable business  letting lower margin business go to competitors 
the call center s sales declined about million due to fewer calls taken and therefore less billable time 
the segment s business is expected to pick up as the economy improves and management secures new accounts with higher margins to replace the lower margin business 
the call center which acts as a consumer and dealer support center for in warranty and out of warranty household products  appliances  parts and accessories for black decker  delonghi  norelco  coby and various other manufacturers 
this call center also acts as a technical support center for these same manufacturers 
the remainder of the decline was in the segment s dealer base  which suffered due to reduced consumer demand 
gross margins consolidated gross margins decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal display segment margins decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal gross margins within the monitor operation decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease was due to an increase in material costs of percentage points offset by a savings of 
table of contents percentage points on the overhead expenses due to cost cutting measures 
the margins for the monitor division are expected to improve as the divisions revenues increase and better efficiencies are achieved within their operations 
data display crt gross margins increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase in margins is primarily a result of product mix and increased pricing on smaller orders 
gross margins in entertainment crts decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the decrease in sales volume of high margin products at the company s louisiana facility and the decreased production at the chroma division 
these margins will continue to decline as these operations are liquidated 
gross margins from component parts decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal for its customers outside the company  primarily reflecting the decrease in need of its products outside the company 
the wholesale distribution segment gross margins increased to for fiscal from for fiscal  primarily due to customer and product mix 
the segment targeted customers with higher margins and the call center business  although it had a slight decrease in sales  contributed to an improvement in the gross margins 
the segment is continuing to focus on profitable business and therefore expects to maintain its gross margins improvements 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily reflecting decreases in salaries  legal fees  research and development and professional services 
the company under took a cost cutting program to align its costs with its revenues 
the company expects to continue to control costs while growing its revenues in the coming year 
display segment operating expenses decreased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the expenses mentioned above as all those reductions occurred in the display segment of the business 
wholesale distribution segment operating expenses decreased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in salaries 
these expenses primarily payroll are classified in general and administrative expense in the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense was flat at million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
the interest expense remained the same primarily reflected by the same levels of borrowings at similar interest rates in effect during fiscal and fiscal income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the higher effective rate in and lower effective rate in were primarily due to research and experimentation credits and various other permanent items 
foreign currency translation gains or losses resulting from the transactions with the company s uk subsidiary were reported in current operations while currency translation adjustments are recognized in a separate component of shareholders equity 
the company closed its operation in the uk and wrote off the foreign currency translation gain 

table of contents management s discussion of liquidity and capital resources at february  and february   the company had total cash of million and million  respectively 
the company s working capital was and million at february  and february  at february   the company s million in outstanding lines of credit were classified as short term debt as the bank agreement expires june  as discussed later in this section 
in recent years  the company has financed its growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations  borrowings under revolving credit facilities  borrowings from its ceo and long term debt 
the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be currently manufactured 
in many instances  the company s products are components of larger display systems for which immediate availability is critical for the customer 
accordingly  the company enjoys higher gross margins  but typically has larger investments in inventories than those of its competitors 
the company continually monitors its cash and financing positions in order to find ways to lower its interest costs and to produce positive operating cash flow 
the company examines possibilities to grow its business through internal sales growth or niche acquisitions 
there could be an impact on working capital requirements to fund this growth 
as in the past  the intent is to finance such projects with operating cash flows or existing bank lines  however  more permanent sources of capital may be required in certain circumstances 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  net working capital items decreased by million due to an increase in accounts receivable of due to large billings on contracts at year end and inventory of due to gearing up for new contracts and a last time buy of crts of million due to manufacturers discontinuing the production of crt inventories 
these increases were offset by a decrease in refundable income taxes of investing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures exclusive of acquisitions were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal and were for general maintenance requirements and computer hardware 
the company does not anticipate significant investments in capital assets for fiscal beyond normal maintenance requirements 
financing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  the company used cash for the repurchase of common stock of  borrowed a net amount of from related parties  and used cash for the net repayment of debt of on september   the company executed a loan and security agreement with rbc bank to provide a million line of credit to the company and a million line of credit to the company s subsidiary fox international  ltd 
as of february   the outstanding balances of these lines of credit were million and million  respectively 
the available amounts for borrowing were million and million  respectively 
these loans are secured by all assets  personal property  and certain real property of the company 
the agreement contains covenants  including requirements related 
table of contents to tangible cash flow  ratio of debt to cash flow  and asset coverage 
the agreement also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt or liens  investments including company stock  divestitures and certain other changes in the business 
the company s million line of credit was extended to june  and accordingly is classified under short term liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
the company s subsidiary  fox international  ltd 
agreement expires in june and is classified in short term liabilities 
the interest rate on these loans is a floating libor rate based on a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the loan documents 
in conjunction with loan and security agreement  the syndicate also executed a million term note with the company repayable in monthly increments of  each through july   and the chief executive officer ceo of the company personally provided a million subordinated term note to the company 
the company s ceo loaned the company an additional million during the fiscal year ending february  leaving the balance outstanding under this loan agreement at approximately million at february  see related information in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
these new lines of credit replaced the existing lines of credit with a syndicate including rbc centura bank and regions bank  which were terminated in conjunction with this agreement 
on may   the company and the rbc bank signed an amendment to the loan and security agreement that extended the million line of credit and the company s subsidiary fox international s million line of credit to september  the company is in negotiations with rbc bank for a new senior secured credit facility 
the bank has indicated its intentions to renew with video display company and is interviewing for a partner to syndicate the loans 
the million facility is expected to have three parts  a million loc  a million equipment term loan for years  and a million real estate term loan for years 
the loc is for a period of months 
the initial pricing is libor bps  with a minimum interest rate of and will be adjusted quarterly based on a quarterly fixed charge cover ratio test with the minimum of in effect 
however  the company is also talking with other financial institutions in the unlikely event it cannot secure new financing with rbc bank 
if the company is unable to refinance its debt with rbc or another financial institution  the bank could exercise its rights against the collateral granted under the terms of the loan agreement 
the company cannot guarantee it will have sufficient assets and funds to repay the borrowings under the debt agreements if this occurs 
management believes it will be successful in its negotiations with the lenders in securing a new loan agreement  however  there can be no assurance an agreement can be reached 
the company has a stock repurchase program  pursuant to which it was originally authorized to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
on july   the board of directors of the company approved a one time continuation of the stock repurchase program  and authorized the company to repurchase up to  additional shares of the company s common stock  depending on the market price of the shares 
there is no minimum number of shares required to be repurchased under the program 
during the fiscal year ended february   the company repurchased  shares at an average price of per share  which have been added to treasury shares on the consolidated balance sheet 
under this program  an additional  shares remain authorized to be repurchased by the company at february  as discussed in note  the loan and security agreement executed by company on june  included restrictions on investments that restricted further repurchases of stock under this program 
the participating banks granted an exception to these restrictions  allowing the company to purchase unlimited shares providing the company meets the covenants in the loan agreement 
under an amendment to the credit agreement signed on august   repurchases are subject to prior written bank approval

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts  contract revenue recognition as well as profitability or loss recognition estimates and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory 
table of contents falls below its carrying amount 
management attempts to determine by historical usage analysis and interchangeability of crt types along with repair contracts currently maintained by its customers  as well as numerous other market factors  the projected demand for crts in this estimate of net realizable value 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
such reviews include observations of product development trends of the oem s  new products being marketed and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the company s existing inventories 
there have been no significant changes in management s estimates in fiscal and  however  the company cannot guarantee the accuracy of future forecasts since these estimates are subject to change based on market conditions 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million and million at february  and february   respectively 
during fiscal  the company wrote down inventories of million to market that had previously been reserved and disposed of million of inventory at its aydin subsidiary that previously had been reserved 
revenue and profit or loss recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collect ability can be reasonably assured 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
in accordance with fasb asc topic revenue recognition principal agent considerations  shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs incurred for the delivery of product to customers are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated statements of operations 
a portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture display systems to a buyer s specification 
these contracts are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc topic revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts 
these contracts are fixed price and cost plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims  or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the wholesale distribution segment has several distribution agreements that it accounts for using the gross revenue basis and one agreement that uses the net revenue basis as prescribed by fasb asc topic revenue recognition principal agent considerations 
the company uses the gross method because the company has general inventory risk  physical loss inventory risk and credit risk on the majority of its agreements but uses the net method on the one agreement because it does not have those same risks for that agreement 
the call center service revenue is recognized based on written pricing agreements with each manufacturer  on a per call  per email  or per standard mail basis 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts is determined by reviewing all accounts receivable and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors as well as payment history and 
table of contents overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
historically  the company s allowance has been sufficient for any customer write offs 
although the company cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 
warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a reserve based on claims experience 
the company considers actual warranty claims compared to net sales  then adjusts its reserve liability accordingly 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
management feels that historically its procedures have been adequate and does not anticipate that its assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future 
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately million of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in a decrease of approximately  in pre tax income assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at february  the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments
