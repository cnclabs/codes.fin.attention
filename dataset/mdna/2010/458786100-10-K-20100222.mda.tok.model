item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition to the other information set forth in this report  you should carefully consider the following factors  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to improve our business processes and systems and transform our supply chain or if those efforts have unintended results 
in order to increase sales and profits  we must continue to expand our operations into new product and geographic markets and deepen our penetration of the markets we currently serve  and do so in ways that are cost effective and efficient from an operational and a tax perspective 
to achieve our objectives  we need to continue to streamline our sales systems  supply chain and business processes and continue to improve our financial  information technology and enterprise resource planning systems 
this may require us to significantly reorganize or restructure our business and  in the case of restructurings  recognize the anticipated costs of such restructurings 
such reorganizations and restructurings may at times be large  complex undertakings 
those activities might not proceed as planned  could result in unintended consequences or might not accomplish the intended goals  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our sales  profits  results of operations and earnings 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  and our success depends upon the timely introduction of new products and our ability to mitigate the risk of product obsolescence 
customer requirements for aidc products are rapidly evolving and technological changes in our industry occur rapidly 
to keep up with new customer requirements and distinguish intermec from our competitors  we must frequently introduce new products and enhancements of existing products through potentially significant investments in research and development r d 
we may not have adequate resources to invest in r d that will keep pace with technological changes in our industry  and any such investments may not result in competitive products 
furthermore  we may not be able to launch new products before our competition launches comparable products 
any of these factors could cause our business to suffer 
rapid technological change  whether through our or our competitors introduction of new products or technologies  could also render our products obsolete and result in substantial excess inventories 
in such event  we might have to sell all or a portion of the excess or obsolete inventory at a substantial discount to the planned resale price or the cost of making or acquiring that inventory and write off the difference 
if our response to technological changes and our ability to introduce new products and product enhancements is not effective  and we do not mitigate the risk of product obsolescence  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
risk factors continued macroeconomic conditions beyond our control could lead to decreases in demand for our products  reduced profitability or deterioration in the quality of our accounts receivable 
domestic and international economic  political and social conditions are uncertain due to a variety of factors  including global  regional and national economic downturns  the availability and cost of credit  volatility in stock and credit markets  energy costs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the risk of global conflict  the risk of terrorism and war in a given country or region  and public health issues 
our business depends on our customers demand for our products and services  the general economic health of current and prospective customers  and their desire or ability to make investments in technology 
a deterioration of global  regional or local political  economic or social conditions could affect potential customers in a way that reduces demand for our products and disrupts our manufacturing and sales plans and efforts 
these global  regional or local conditions also could disrupt commerce in ways that could interrupt our supply chain and our ability to get products to our customers 
these conditions may also affect our ability to conduct business as usual 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact reported revenue and expenses 
in addition  our sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms that are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in the country in which the customer is located 
a deterioration of political  economic or social conditions in a given country or region could reduce or eliminate our ability to collect accounts receivable in that country or region 
in any of these events  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and more profitable than we are  which may give them a competitive advantage 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
due to acquisitions and other consolidation of the aidc industry  competition is likely to intensify 
some of our competitors have substantially more revenue or profit than we do 
the scale advantage of these companies may allow them to invest more in r d  sales and marketing  and customer support than we can or to achieve more efficient economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution 
the scale advantage may also allow them to acquire or make complementary products that alone or in combination with other aidc products could afford them a competitive advantage 
these advantages may enable our larger competitors to weather market downturns longer or adapt more quickly to emerging technology developments  market trends or price declines than we can 
those competitors may also be able to precipitate such market changes by introducing new technologies  reducing their prices or otherwise changing their activities 
there is no assurance that our strategies to counteract our competitors advantages will successfully offset all or a portion of this scale imbalance 
if we are unable to offset all or a significant portion of this imbalance  our earnings may be materially and adversely affected 
business combinations and similar transactions might occur  alter the structure of the aidc industry  intensify competition and create other risks for our business 
our industry could experience a new series of acquisitions  joint ventures  strategic alliances or private equity transactions  these events could alter the structure of the aidc industry and intensify competition within our industry by expanding the presence of companies that have greater business and financial resources than the firms they acquired or by increasing the market share of some companies in our industry 
such increased competition could have material adverse impacts to our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
there is no assurance that any of the strategies we employ to respond to the structural changes and related increased competition will be successful 
item a 
risk factors continued as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire or make investments in other businesses  patents  technologies  products or services  and our failure to do so successfully may adversely affect our competitive position or financial results 
our growth could be hampered if we are unable to identify suitable acquisitions and investments or agree on the terms of any such acquisition or investment 
we may not be able to consummate any such transaction if we lack sufficient resources to finance the transaction on our own and cannot obtain financing at a reasonable cost 
if we are not able to complete such transactions  our competitive position may suffer  which could have adverse impacts on our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
our business combinations or other transactions may not succeed in generating the intended benefits and therefore adversely affect shareholder value or our financial results 
integration of new businesses or technologies into our business may have any of the following adverse effects we may have difficulty transitioning customers and other business relationships to intermec 
we may have problems unifying management following a transaction 
we may lose key employees from our existing or acquired businesses 
we may experience intensified competition from other companies seeking to expand sales and market share during the integration period 
furthermore  in order to complete such transactions  we may have to use cash  issue new equity securities with dilutive effects on existing shareholders  take on new debt  assume contingent liabilities or amortize assets or expenses in a manner that might have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet or results of operations 
we may also consume considerable management time and attention on the integration that would divert resources from the development and operation of our existing business 
these and other potential problems could prevent us from realizing the benefits of such transactions and have a material adverse impact on our revenues  revenue growth  balance sheet and results of operations 
growth of and changes in our revenues and profits depend on the customer  product and geographic mix of our sales 
fluctuations in our sales mix could have an adverse impact on or increase the volatility of our revenues  gross margins and profits 
sales to large enterprises tend to have lower prices and gross margins than sales to smaller firms 
in addition  our gross margins vary depending on the product or service and the geographic region in which sales are made 
growth in our revenues and gross margins therefore depends on the customer  product and geographic mix of our sales 
if we are unable to execute a sales strategy that results in a favorable sales mix  our revenues  gross margins and earnings may decline 
further  changes in the mix of our sales from quarter to quarter or year to year may make our revenues  gross margins and earnings more volatile and difficult to predict 
item a 
risk factors continued fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
due to our global operations  our cash flows  revenue and earnings are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our international sales are typically quoted  billed and collected in the customer s local currency  but our product costs are largely denominated in us dollars 
therefore  our product margins are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the cost of goods and services that we purchase and personnel that we employ outside of the united states 
when appropriate  we may attempt to limit our exposure to exchange rate changes by entering into short term currency exchange contracts 
there is no assurance that we will hedge or will be able to hedge such foreign currency exchange risk or that our hedges will be successful 
our currency exchange gains or losses net of hedges may materially and adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
additionally  adverse movements in currency exchange rates could result in increases in our cost of goods sold or reduction in growth in international orders  materially impacting our cash flows and earnings 
our reliance on third party distributors could adversely affect our business  revenues and earnings 
in addition to offering our products to certain customers and resellers directly  we rely to a significant and increasing degree on third party distributors and integrators to sell our products to end users 
in and  one distributor  scansource  inc  accounted for more than of our sales  and it or other distributors may account for a substantial portion of our sales in the future 
changes in markets  customers or products  or negative developments in general economic and financial conditions and the availability of credit  may adversely affect the ability of these distributors to effectively bring our products to market at the right time and in the right locations 
in addition  if a significant distributor  such as scansource  were to become unavailable or substantially reduce its purchases from us  we would be required to obtain alternative sources of distribution or enhance our internal sales force 
such a disruption in the distribution of our products could impair or delay sales of our products to end users and increase our costs of distribution  which could adversely affect our sales or income 
we face risks as a global company that could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations 
due to the global nature of our business  we face risks that companies operating in a single country or region do not have 
us and foreign government restrictions on the export or import of technology could prevent us from selling some or all of our products in one or more countries 
our sales could also be materially and adversely affected by burdensome laws  regulations  security requirements  tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments 
in addition  political and economic instability in a particular country or region could reduce demand for our products or impair or eliminate our ability to sell or deliver those products to customers in those countries or put our assets at risk 
any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand sales of our products in any market  and disruptions of our sales could materially and adversely impact our revenues  revenue growth  gross profit margins and results of operations 
a significant percentage of our products and components for those products are designed  manufactured  produced  delivered  serviced or supported in countries outside of the us from time to time  we contract with companies outside of the us to perform one or more of these activities  or portions of these activities 
for operational  legal or other reasons  we may have to change the mix of domestic and international operations or move outsourced activities from one overseas vendor to another 
in addition  us or foreign government actions or economic or political instability and potentially weaker foreign ip protections may disrupt or require changes in our international operations or international outsourcing arrangements 
the process of implementing such changes and dealing with such disruptions is complex and can be expensive 
there is no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these tasks in an efficient or cost effective manner  if at all 
if we encounter difficulties in making such transitions  our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
risk factors continued we are dependent on venture corporation limited for the manufacture of substantially all of our current products and any failure or inability of venture to provide its manufacturing services to us could adversely affect our business 
in relying on venture to assemble our current products  we no longer have direct physical control over the manufacturing process and operations 
this might adversely affect our ability to control the quality of our current products and the timeliness of their delivery to our customers 
either of those potential consequences could adversely affect our customer relationships and our revenues 
furthermore  venture s access to our ip could possibly increase the risk of infringement or misappropriation of our assets 
if venture were unable to manufacture our current products at one or more of its facilities for any extended period  we would be required to obtain alternative sources of manufacturing 
there is no assurance that any such sources would be available in a timely manner or at comparable cost 
any such interruption of venture s manufacturing capabilities could increase our costs  impair our ability to provide our customers with our products in a timely and efficient manner and adversely affect our customer relationships and our financial results 
use of third party suppliers and service providers could adversely affect our product quality  delivery schedules or customer satisfaction  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
third party suppliers that we approve will be providing the components that venture or other of our contract manufacturers will use in the final assembly of our products 
some of these components may be available only from a single source or limited sources  and if they become unavailable for any reason  we or our contract manufacturers may be unable to obtain alternative sources of supply on a timely basis 
we also outsource a number of services to us and us third party service providers  including transportation and logistics management of spare parts 
our products and services may be adversely affected by the quality control of these third party suppliers and service providers  or by their inability to ship product  manage our product inventory  or meet delivery deadlines 
failure of these third party suppliers and service providers in any of these respects may negatively affect our revenue and customer relationships 
furthermore  these suppliers and service providers may have access to our ip  which may increase the risk of infringement or misappropriation 
our failure to expand our ip portfolio could adversely affect the growth of our business and results of operations 
expansion of our ip portfolio is one of the available methods of growing our revenues and our profits 
this involves a complex and costly set of activities with uncertain outcomes 
our ability to obtain patents and other ip can be adversely affected by insufficient inventiveness of our employees  by changes in ip laws  treaties  and regulations  and by judicial and administrative interpretations of those laws treaties and regulations 
our ability to expand our ip portfolio could also be adversely affected by the lack of valuable ip for sale or license at affordable prices 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain valuable ip in the jurisdictions where we and our competitors operate or that we will be able to use or license that ip or that we will be able to generate meaningful royalty revenue or profits from our ip 
our inability to successfully defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect the growth of our business and results of operations 
to protect our ip portfolio  we may be required to initiate patent infringement lawsuits 
ip infringement lawsuits are complex proceedings  and the results are very difficult to predict 
there is no assurance that we will prevail in all or any of these cases or that we will achieve the desired outcome in terms of injunctive relief or damages or that the other parties will be able to pay the damages awarded 
adverse results in such lawsuits could give competitors the legal right to compete with us and with our licensees using technology that is similar to or the same as ours 
adverse outcomes in ip lawsuits could also reduce our royalty revenues 
in some periods  ip litigation recoveries and expenses could result in large fluctuations from prior periods  increase the volatility of our financial results or have a material adverse impact on our operating profits  results of earnings or earnings per share 
since our business strategy includes global expansion  we are operating in developing countries where the institutional structures for creating and enforcing ip rights are very new or non existent and where government agencies  courts and market participants have little experience with ip rights 
there is no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology in such countries because we may not be able to enforce ip rights in those jurisdictions and alternative methods of protecting our ip rights may not be effective 
our inability to prevent competitors in these developing markets from misappropriating our technology could materially and adversely affect our sales  revenues and results of operations 
item a 
risk factors continued our inability to successfully defend ourselves from the intellectual property infringement claims of others could have an adverse affect on the growth of our business and results of operations 
our competitors  our potential competitors and other companies may have ip rights covering products and services similar to those we market and sell 
these firms may try to use their ip right to prevent us from selling some of our products  to collect royalties from us  or to deter us from enforcing our ip rights against them 
those efforts may include infringement lawsuits against us or our customers 
these lawsuits are complex proceedings with uncertain outcomes 
there is no assurance that we or our customers will prevail in any ip lawsuits initiated by third parties 
if the results of such litigation are adverse to us or our customers  we could be enjoined from selling and our customers could be enjoined from using our products or services and ordered to pay for past damages 
we might also be required to pay future royalties or be forced to incur the cost of designing around the third party s ip 
in some periods  ip litigation expenses could result in large fluctuations from prior periods 
any of these events could increase the volatility of our financial results or have a material adverse effect on our sales  revenues  operating profits  results of operations or earnings per share 
our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results 
due to the global nature of our business  we are subject to national and local taxation in many different countries  and we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by the tax authorities in those countries 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
there is no assurance that all or any of these tax audits will be resolved in our favor 
in addition  under applicable accounting rules  the value that we report for our deferred tax assets reflects our estimate for these assets  net of those that we believe are more likely than not to expire before being utilized 
our financial results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities or deferred tax assets in the periods when the tax assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitations on the tax assessments or tax attributes expire 
the outcome of these tax assessments or estimates could have a material positive or negative impact on our earnings and increase the volatility of our earnings relative to prior periods 
in some jurisdictions  favorable tax rates are subject to our compliance with agreements we have reached with the relevant government agencies 
if we are unable to meet the requirements of those agreements  the tax rate in that jurisdiction might change in an unfavorable manner and could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate and our financial results 
global regulation and regulatory compliance  including environmental  technological and standards setting regulations  may limit our sales or increase our costs  which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
we are subject to domestic and international technical and environmental standards and regulations that govern or influence the design  components or operation of our products 
such standards and regulations may also require us to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
our ability to sell aidc products in a given country and the gross margins on products sold in a given country could be affected by such regulations 
we are also subject to self imposed standards setting activities sponsored by organizations such as iso  aim  ieee and epcglobal that provide our customers with the ability to seamlessly use our products with products from other aidc vendors  which our customers demand 
changes in standards and regulations may be introduced at any time and with little or no time to bring products into compliance with the revised technical standard or regulation 
standards and regulations may prevent us from selling one or more of our products in a particular country  increase our cost of supplying our products by requiring us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components  require us to obtain services or create infrastructure in a particular country to address collection  recycling and similar obligations  or require us to license our patents on a royalty free basis and prevent us from seeking damages and injunctive relief for patent infringements 
in these cases  we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with our products or may have to incur unexpected costs to bring our products into compliance 
due to these uncertainties and compliance burdens  our customers may postpone or cancel purchases of our products 
as a result  global regulation and compliance could have an adverse effect on our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 
item a 
risk factors continued our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain skilled managers and employees 
competition for skilled employees is high in our industry  and we must remain competitive in terms of compensation and other employee benefits to retain key employees 
if we are unsuccessful in hiring and retaining skilled managers and employees  we will be unable to maintain and expand our business

the unfavorable global economy adversely affected our business and revenue in fiscal as customers cut back on spending 
to mitigate the impact on our business due to the economic downturn  we implemented various cost containment programs in  including adjustments to our cost structure 
as a result of these programs  we reached our objective of lowering annualized break even point in the third and fourth quarters of and achieving profitability exiting at the same time that we were reducing expenses  we remained focused on new products launches and channel expansion 
our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  and changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our financial trends and reported results 
our consolidated revenues and operating expenses are vulnerable to the fluctuations of foreign exchange rates  however  our cost of revenues is primarily denominated in us dollars  and therefore  is less affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
if the us dollar weakens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations  our consolidated revenues  costs of revenues and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant 
if the us dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations  our consolidated revenues  costs of revenues and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant 
we believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of foreign currency changes 
in  we divested businesses unrelated to our continuing operations 
the divested businesses are our discontinued operations

geographic region revenue change amount percent amount percent north america europe  middle east and africa emea all others total revenues item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenues declined across all of our product lines and geographic regions in primarily driven by reduced product volumes due to the global economic downturn 
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on total revenues was million in  or percentage points  as compared to the decrease in product revenues from to consisted of a decrease in system and solutions revenues of million and a decrease in printer and media revenues of million 
the decline in system and solutions revenues from to was primarily attributable to reduced product sales in north american market of million  or  and in the european market of million  or  as customers cut back on capital spending 
sales for printer and media products followed a similar trend in  with north american market accounting for million  or  and european market accounting for million  or  of the total decrease in printer and media revenues as compared with the decrease in service revenues was primarily from north american and european markets  which corresponded to lower product volumes in these markets in as compared with geographically  product and service revenues decreased in all regions  with the largest declines in north american and emea in as compared with the changes in foreign currency conversion rates unfavorably impacted emea revenue by million in  or percentage points  as compared to additionally  revenues in emea included a european enterprise postal deployment  which was not repeated in and accounted for percentage points of the decline in the emea region from to the lower product revenues in latin america accounted for approximately of total revenue decrease in the rest of the world row 
product revenues in increased million  or  compared to the growth in our product revenue was driven by system and solutions revenues  which increased million  or  in as compared to this increase resulted from north america systems and solutions revenue growth as a result of larger direct accounts  sales to the us government department of defense and higher revenue through our distribution partners 
the increase in revenues from systems and solutions in was offset by a million  or  decline in our printer and media revenue for the comparable periods 
the decrease in printer and media revenue in was primarily related to less revenue in latin america  which had a number of large direct accounts that included significant printer revenue in product revenues in europe  the middle east and africa emea were flat in compared to  which includes approximately million from favorable changes in currency exchange rates in compared to product revenue in the row decreased  primarily due to lower product revenue in latin america  which had a number of large direct accounts in service revenues of million for were down million  or  compared to we experienced higher service revenue in emea  which was more than offset by lower service revenue in north america and latin america in compared to the decrease in north america service revenues from to was primarily a result of fewer time and material repairs 
geographically  for the year ended december   product and service revenues increased in north america by  while emea remained flat and row decreased as compared to the growth in north america revenue in was primarily attributable to strong system and solutions revenue 
the revenue decrease in row in was primarily attributable to lower product revenue in latin america  which had a number of sales to large direct accounts in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit gross profit and gross margin by revenue category for the years ended december   and  were as follows in millions year ended december  gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin product service total gross profit and gross margin the total gross profit in decreased by million and the total gross margin decreased by basis points compared to the decrease in total gross margin in was primarily due to a decrease in product gross margin  partially offset by an increase in service gross margin 
the decrease in total gross profit was primarily due to a million decrease in product gross profit  which was driven by reduced product volumes  less favorable product and geographic related mix  the unfavorable impact of currency translation and competitive pricing 
the decrease in product gross margin in was primarily attributable to reduced product volumes  less favorable product and geographic related mix  the unfavorable impact of currency translation and competitive pricing 
the increase in service gross margin was mainly attributable to the reduced service costs from the us service depot consolidation program implemented in the third quarter of  and ongoing cost management 
total gross profit for the year ended december   increased million  or  compared to that increase in total gross profit was primarily due to the increase in product revenue  combined with a basis point improvement in the related gross margin as compared with the increase in product gross margins in was primarily a result of a higher proportion of our product revenue from systems and solutions  the favorable impact from foreign exchange rate movements  component cost reductions and higher capacity utilization related to the revenue growth 
service gross profit decreased by million  or  in compared to due primarily to the decrease in related revenue 
research and development expense  net in millions year ended december  amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount research and development expense  net research and development r d expense decreased million  or  in  compared to the decrease in r d expense was primarily driven by various cost reduction programs we implemented in  including labor related savings of million 
additionally  included in r d expense were million in credits from us and foreign governments relating to reimbursement of certain r d expenses 
r d expense accounted for of revenues in  compared to and of revenues in and  respectively 
r d expense decreased in absolute dollars in  while r d expense as a percentage of total revenues increased in  reflecting our continued focus on product development and product releases

substantially all of the remaining decrease in sg a was attributable to a reduction in indirect and discretionary spending 
the increase in sg a expense in of million compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase for information systems expense  primarily resulting from higher depreciation expense and consulting costs  as a result of our erp upgrade  a million increase due to the impact of international costs translated to us dollars at less favorable average exchange rates during  a million increase in foreign exchange contract and re measurement losses  and higher labor costs 
flood related charges in june  our cedar rapids  iowa facilities were flooded  and we incurred damages to both a facility that we own and one that we lease 
a portion of these damages was covered by insurance 
while the flood caused extensive damage  we were able to redirect the work performed by our cedar rapids groups to temporary locations and avoided significant interruptions of our business 
for the year ended december   we had million in clean up costs and property damages that were partially offset by million of insurance proceeds for a net charge of million 
restructuring costs restructuring charges in january  we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to reorganize our sales function  reduce our operating cost structure and improve efficiency 
the total restructuring costs for this plan are expected to be approximately million  including employee termination costs of approximately million  and million of other transitional costs 
we recorded million of the restructuring charge in  and the remainder will be recorded through we anticipate that substantially all of the severance related and periodic transitional costs will be cash expenditures 
we expect to achieve an annual labor related savings of to million upon completion of this restructuring plan 
in april  we committed to a business restructuring plan primarily consisting of a reduction of our work force 
at the time we adopted this plan  we estimated that the total restructuring costs would be in a pre tax range of to million 
due to a very successful operational and expense management  we were able to reduce the number of positions impacted by this plan and the related severance charges in the third quarter of as a result  we reduced our estimate of the total restructuring costs of this plan to an anticipated pre tax range of to million  including employee termination costs of to million  and to million of other transitional costs 
we recorded million of the restructuring charges in  and expect to record the remainder through we anticipate that substantially all of the severance related and periodic transitional costs will be cash expenditures 
we expect to achieve annualized labor related savings of to million upon completion of this restructuring plan 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restructuring charges in july  we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to reduce our cost structure and streamline operations  which included the relocation of product final assembly to a contract manufacturer in asia  the consolidation of north american service depot locations and the transfer of on site repair in north america to a third party service provider 
all severance and other periodic transitional costs were cash expenditures 
all restructuring costs related to this action were accrued in the total restructuring charges incurred for the restructuring plan were million 
we believe these restructuring actions were appropriate strategically and were prudent in light of the generally weakened global economy and uncertain market conditions

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued foreign currency transactions and effect of foreign exchange rates we are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations 
currency exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program  which is designed to minimize short term exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
movements in foreign exchange rates  net of hedging activities  resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  million was reported in error in foreign currency transaction loss 
for fiscal year  our operations derived approximately of revenues from non us customers 
at december   long lived assets attributable to countries outside of the us comprised of total long lived assets 
the largest components of these assets are attributable to mexico  where we maintain product repair facilities  followed by france  where we maintain a research and development center 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations 
cash flow summary our cash flows were summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  an increase of million compared to the december   balance of million 
our short term investments consist primarily of low risk securities  including bond funds and time deposits 
we invest in these short term securities mainly to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation 
due to the nature of these instruments  we consider it reasonable to expect that their fair market values will not be significantly impacted by a change in interest rates  and that they can be liquidated for cash upon demand 
cash provided by operating activities consisted of net loss earnings adjusted for non cash items and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in was million and consisted of net loss from continuing operations of million  adjustments for non cash items of million and cash provided by working capital and other activities of million 
operating activities in provided lower cash flows compared to  primarily due to a net loss of million including discontinued operations and cash payment of million for restructuring activities 
however  cash provided by working capital and other activities in increased by million compared to  primarily due to our efforts in inventory reduction 
in  the million of cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was primarily due to net earnings of million and a million decrease in accounts receivable  offset partially by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
in  the million of cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was primarily due to net earnings from continuing operations of million and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset partially by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
in  investing activities of continuing operations used million of cash primarily due to our purchase of short term investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
in  investing activities of continuing operations provided million of cash primarily due to sale of investments of million and sale of property  plant and equipment of million 
in  investing activities of continuing operations used million of cash primarily due to capital expenditures of million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued financing activities of continuing operations in provided cash of million  related primarily to the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and exercised stock options 
financing activities of continuing operations in used million of cash  primarily for the million debt repayment in march of financing activities of continuing operations in provided million primarily due to million in proceeds from stock option exercises and million in excess tax benefits from stock based payment arrangements 
net cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in was million  related primarily to note receivable maturities 
capital resources our principal capital resources include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  we have an unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving facility with a maximum amount available under the revolving facility of million 
net of outstanding letters of credit and limitations on availability  we had borrowing capacity at december   of million under the revolving facility 
we had no borrowings under the revolving facility as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the revolving facility 
the revolving facility matures in october the key terms of the revolving facility are as follows loans will bear interest at a variable rate equal to at our option i libor plus the applicable margin  which ranges from to  or ii the bank s prime rate  less the applicable margin  which ranges from to 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  then the interest rate on all obligations under the revolving facility may be increased by above the otherwise applicable rate  and the bank may declare any outstanding obligations under the revolving facility to be immediately due and payable 
a fee ranging from to on the maximum amount available to be drawn under each letter of credit that is issued and outstanding under the revolving facility 
the fee on the unused portion of the revolving facility ranges from to 
certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving facility 
the revolving facility contains various restrictions and covenants  including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to consolidate or merge  make acquisitions  create liens  incur additional indebtedness or dispose of assets 
financial covenants include a maximum leverage test and a minimum tangible net worth test  each as defined in the revolving facility 
the minimum tangible net worth required is  and the maximum funded debt to ebitda allowed is we believe that cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments combined with projected cash flows from operations will provide adequate funding to meet our expected working capital  restructuring cost  capital expenditure and pension contribution requirements for the next twelve months 
from time to time  we may look for potential acquisition targets for growth opportunities within our market  or to expand into new markets 
the business restructuring plan that we committed to in april reduced our workforce and resulted in the curtailment of pension benefits to the terminated employees who were participants in our us pension plans 
additionally  on december   we announced the decision to amend our pension plans and freeze the remainder of our us pension plans effective february  these actions are expected to substantially reduce our future pension benefits cost 
we are not required to make minimum funding for these plans under the employee retirement income security act of erisa or other rules governing funding of pension plans 
however  we may make discretionary contributions to fund these plans in future years 
we anticipate contributing approximately million to our pension plans in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued depending on our assessment of the economic environment from time to time  we may decide to hold more cash than may be required to fund our future investment in working capital  capital expenditures and research and development and to implement changes in our cost structure 
projected cash flows from operations are largely based on our revenue estimates  cost estimates  and the related timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements 
if actual performance differs from estimated performance  cash flows from operations could be positively or negatively impacted 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments for continuing operations as of december  in millions 
the table does not include amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase commitments pension and other postretirement cash funding requirements total contractual obligations operating leases are discussed in note f to our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement plans are discussed in note k to our consolidated financial statements 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of finished goods or raw materials or other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons 
we are not required to provide minimum funding for our pension and other postretirement benefits plans under erisa regulations  although we may make future discretionary contributions to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to be required in order to adequately fund the plans  and to match a portion of the employees contribution 
see note k to our consolidated financial statements for details 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million at december   has been omitted from the table above  because we cannot determine with certainty when this liability will be settled 
we expect to fund these contractual obligations with our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain indemnification and reimbursement agreements 
for discussion of these arrangements  see note l to our consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue  net of excise and sales taxes  when it is realized  or realizable  and earned 
we consider these criteria met when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recorded when earned  the amount due is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for product sales  revenue is recognized when the customer has assumed risk of loss of the goods sold and all performance obligations are complete 
these sales may contain discounts  price exception  return provision or other customer incentives 
we reduce revenue by providing allowances for estimated customer returns  price exception and other incentives that occur under sales programs established by us directly or with our distributors and resellers 
the sales allowances are based on management s best estimate of the amount of allowances that the customer will ultimately receive and was based on our historical experience taking into account the type of products sold and type of customers involved 
we accrue the estimated cost of basic product warranties at the time we recognize revenue based on historical experience 
in addition to basic product warranties  we frequently offer extended warranties  including renewal  to our customers in the form of product maintenance services 
our product and maintenance services are typically separately priced 
we defer the stated amount of the separately priced product maintenance services contracts and recognized the deferred revenue as services are rendered  generally straight line over the contract term 
we infrequently enter into multiple element arrangements with our customers  and these sales may include deliverables such as hardware  software  professional consulting services and maintenance support services 
for arrangements involving multiple deliverables  where deliverables include software and non software products and services  we apply the provisions of multiple elements accounting to separate the deliverables and allocate the total arrangement consideration 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
we sell products with embedded software to our customers 
the embedded software is not sold separately  it is not a significant focus of the marketing effort and we do not provide post contract customer support specific to the software or incur significant costs related to creating software products 
additionally  the functionality that the software provides is marketed as part of the overall product 
the software embedded in the product is incidental to the equipment as a whole such that software revenue recognition is not generally applicable 
in certain infrequent situations where our solutions contain software that is more than incidental to the hardware and services  revenue related to the software and software related elements is recognized in accordance with software revenue recognition accounting 
our customers may request that delivery and passage of title and risk of loss occur on a bill and hold basis 
for these transactions  we recognize revenue in accordance with guidance specific to bill and hold transactions 
for each of the three years ended december   the amount from bill and hold transactions approximated less than of total revenue 
inventory obsolescence 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  or there are technology or design changes  additional inventory write downs could be required  which would negatively impact our gross margin 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions  and or technology or design changes  could positively impact future operating results if previously written down inventory is sold 
management continues to evaluate market and technology conditions and design changes to ensure that we are adequately reserved 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards and other tax credits 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent  feasible and permissible tax planning strategies in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if we were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
we conduct business in various countries throughout the world and are subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions 
as a result of our business activities  we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
we also recognize the largest amount of benefits from uncertain tax positions that are greater than determined by cumulative probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
such amounts are based on management s judgment and best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we have qualified and nonqualified pension plans that cover some of our employees 
some of these pension plans were partially frozen in june additionally  on december   we made the decision to fully freeze our us qualified pension plan  effective february  our us nonqualified plans were fully frozen effective december  annual employer contributions are made to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to be required in order to adequately fund the plans  and to match a portion of the employees contribution 
retiree benefits are based on the amount of participant contributions over the term of the participant s employment 
we perform an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets or when major events occurred requiring for remeasurement 
these measurements require several assumptions  the most important of which are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and health care cost projections 
these assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events or different rates of retirement  mortality or withdrawal  positively or negatively affecting our future annual expense and projected benefit obligation 
the rate used to discount future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date  reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments 
the discount rates for our domestic and foreign plans as of december   were and respectively  compared to and as of december  the decrease in the discount rate used for domestic plans reflects lower interest rates in the current market 
a one half percentage point decrease in our discount rate on pension cost would result in an increase in benefit obligation of million 
the expected return on plan assets is based on the market related value of assets 
for the market related value of assets  a calculated basis is used to reflect a smoothed actuarial value of assets  equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is recognized over a five year period for us plans and a three year period for us plans 
to determine the expected long term rate of return  we use historic market trends combined with current market conditions 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return for our domestic and foreign plans was and  respectively 
a one half percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would result in an increase in our net periodic pension cost of million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits include a discount rate of and at december   and  respectively 
the effect on our postretirement benefit cost of one half percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be immaterial 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for fiscal year was and is projected to decrease over years to  where it is expected to remain thereafter 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is not material 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the postretirement benefit obligation would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million 
the difference between actual amounts and estimates based on actuarial assumptions is recognized in other comprehensive income loss in the period in which they occur

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb updated its guidance on software revenue recognition rules 
according to this update  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
this update requires that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance 
this update provides additional guidance on how to determine which software  if any  relating to the tangible product should be excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   but early adoption is permitted 
this update must be adopted in the same period using the same transition method as indicated below in the update to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of this update may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb updated its guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
it alters the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
this update also replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a market participant 
it also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   but early adoption is permitted 
we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange rates due to our global operations  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates 
we conduct business in approximately countries throughout the world and generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable balance 
our subsidiaries also purchase certain raw materials and other items in local currencies 
our treasury policies allow us to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures through the purchase of foreign exchange forward contracts 
our policy prohibits speculation in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange arising from intercompany transactions  specifically for inventory purchases made by our subsidiaries that are denominated in us dollars 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes 
accordingly  we record these contracts at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change 
these contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features 
we attempt to manage the counterparty risk associated with these foreign exchange forward contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have an established banking relationship 
in addition  these contracts generally settle in approximately days 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent movement in currency exchange rates applied to the exposure described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that if our hedges of exchange exposure were not in place  such market movements would have an impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
the actual gains or losses in the future may differ significantly from that analysis  if changes in the timing and amount of currency exchange rate movements and our hedging activities are different from during  our sales comprised million or  denominated in us dollars  million  or  denominated in euros  million  or  denominated in british pounds  and million  or denominated in other foreign currencies 
fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates negatively impacted our sales by approximately million in  in comparison to
