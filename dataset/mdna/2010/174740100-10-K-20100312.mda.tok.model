item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations realized gains losses on investments 
gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may be realized or result in future impairments  resulting in a reduction in our net income 
fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss and are  therefore  excluded from net income 
our total gross unrealized losses on our available for sale securities portfolio at december  were million 
the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other than temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken 
realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period 
our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims and we may be required to establish additional reserves  which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies 
reserves  whether calculated under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators  do not represent an exact calculation of exposure  but instead represent our best estimates  generally involving actuarial projections  of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities 
many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
in addition  when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies  our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions 
reserve estimates are refined as experience develops  and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated 
because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses  future developments may require us to increase claims reserves  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates policy liabilities 
unexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the company s valuation allowance relative to our deferred tax asset dta was million at december  the valuation allowance was established based on facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date  which indicated it was more likely than not that some or all of the dta would not be realized 
currently  we evaluate our dta quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence 
this process involves management s judgment about assumptions  which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results 
ultimately  future adjustments to the dta valuation allowance  if any  will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets 
the realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition and capital position

we may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired  which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
at december   we had million of deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac 
dac represents costs that vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies 
these costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions  solicitation and printing costs  sales material costs and some support costs  such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses 
under us gaap  dac is amortized to income over the lives of the underlying policies  in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums 
in addition  when we acquire a block of insurance policies  we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies 
this intangible asset  called the cost of customer relationships acquired  or ccra  represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies 
at december   we had million of ccra 
we amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of dac 
our amortization of dac and ccra generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments  surrender and other policy charges  mortality  morbidity  persistency and maintenance expense margins 
for example  if our insurance policy lapse and surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies  or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions  especially in the early years of a policy  we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy 
we regularly review the quality of our dac and ccra to determine if they are recoverable from future income 
if these costs are not recoverable  they are charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination 
unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses  investment returns  surrender and other policy changes  mortality  morbidity  lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of dac or ccra  or both  or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

we may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill  which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition 
under us gaap  we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment 
goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value 
this may occur for various reasons  including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit  generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units 
if any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired  we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current period expense  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

fernando hakim daccach  in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and affirmed by the court of appeals for the third district of texas 
we appealed the grant of class status to the texas supreme court  which on march   reversed the court of appeal s affirmation of the trial court s class certification order  decertified the class and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the texas supreme court s opinion 
the underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies we made available to non us residents  when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non us trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our class a common stock  along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts  were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the texas securities laws 
the remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments 
on november   the trial court conducted further proceedings on the case  in order to determine whether the class should be recertified

security plan fire insurance company spfic is a defendant in a suit styled the state of louisiana v 
aaa insurance  or road home litigation  which was filed in the civil district court for the parish of orleans on august  by the state of louisiana as subrogee assignee of the insureds of more than different insurance companies 
the suit was filed to recover money that the state of louisiana paid to certain insureds under the louisiana road home program for damages resulting from hurricanes katrina and rita 
the suit was removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana on september  in march  the trial court judge dismissed all bad faith claims asserted against the defendants  including spfic 
the judge also dismissed all claims for flood damage and all claims asserted under louisiana s valued policy law 
due to the district court s recent rulings noted above  we no longer believe an adverse ruling in the road home litigation would have a material impact on our financial statements 
in addition to these lawsuits  we may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations  including  but not limited to  other possible disputes relating to the non us trusts or the plan referred to above and the investment by many of our foreign policyholders in our class a common stock of certain cash dividends they receive from their insurance policies 
if allegations similar to those made in certain of these lawsuits regarding the application of texas or other securities laws to the assignment of policy dividends were determined to be valid  we could face the possibility of other securities law claims within the united states 
also  we could be faced with contingent liabilities with respect to possible claims for violations of securities laws  the extent of which would be difficult to determine 
in the absence of countervailing considerations  we would expect to defend any such claims  and we could incur significant defense costs  including not only attorneys fees and other direct litigation costs  but also the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business 
this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
reinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations  leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage 
we reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase 
the high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal 
we may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and  even if highly desirable or necessary  we may not be able to obtain replacement reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at rates economic to us 
if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities  either our net exposures would increase or  if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures  we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
in addition  our reinsurance facilities may be cancelled  pursuant to their terms  upon the occurrence of certain specified events  including a change of control of our company generally defined as the acquisition of or more of our voting equity securities or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus 
any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues  results of operations and financial condition

and consolidated subsidiaries in  we reinsured million of face amount of our life insurance policies 
amounts reinsured in represented of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year 
although the cost of reinsurance is  in some cases  reflected in premium rates  under certain reinsurance agreements  the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance 
if our cost of reinsurance were to increase  we might not be able to recover these increased costs  and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
we may not be able to continue our past strategy of acquiring other us life insurance companies  and we may not realize improvements to our financial results as a result of our past or any future acquisitions 
we have acquired us life insurance companies since our objective in this strategy has been to increase our assets  revenues and capital  improve our competitive position and increase our earnings  in part by realizing certain operating efficiencies associated with economies of scale 
we evaluate possible acquisitions of other insurance companies on an ongoing basis 
while our business model is not dependent primarily upon acquisitions  the time frame for achieving or further improving our market positions can be shortened through acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions presenting opportunities for continued growth and operating efficiencies will be available to us  or that we will realize the anticipated financial results from completed acquisitions 
even if we identify and complete insurance company acquisitions  we may be unable to integrate them on an economically favorable basis 
implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a number of risks  including  among others  inaccurate assessment of assets  liabilities or contingent liabilities and the failure to achieve anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flow 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our international and domestic operations face significant competition 
our international marketing plan focuses on making available us dollar denominated life insurance products to high net worth  high income individuals residing in more than countries 
new competition could cause the supply of insurance to change  which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates to us  thereby adversely affecting our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
although there are some impediments facing potential competitors that wish to enter the foreign markets we serve  the entry of new competitors into these markets may occur  affording our customers reason to change to other insurance providers 
in connection with our business with foreign nationals  we experience competition primarily from the following sources  many of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have foreign operated companies with us dollar policies 
we face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets 
companies foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but that issue local currency policies 
another group of our competitors in the international marketplace consists of companies that are foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but issue life insurance policies denominated in the local currencies of those countries 
local currency policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents  but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations  as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies 
locally operated companies with local currency policies 
we compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside 
generally  these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations  and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole 
these mortality tables are typically based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use 
as a result  the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours 
although these companies typically market their policies to a broader section of the population than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants  there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us 
in the united states  we compete with more than  other life insurance companies of various sizes 
the life insurance business in the united states is highly competitive  in part because it is a mature industry that  in recent years  has experienced little to no growth in life insurance sales 
many domestic life insurance companies have substantially greater financial resources  longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance coverage than we do 
these companies also have larger sales forces than we have 
competition in the united states has also increased recently because the life insurance industry is consolidating  with larger  more efficient organizations emerging from the consolidation 
in addition  legislation became effective in that permits commercial banks  insurance companies and investment banks to combine 
this legislation permits  for instance  a commercial bank to acquire or form an insurance company 
we believe these factors have increased competitive pressures in the life insurance market in general 

table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries in addition  from time to time  companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate  thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants 
we may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices  or for other reasons 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets 
if we do not  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
sales of our products may be reduced if we are unable to i establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants ii attract and retain employee agents or iii develop and maintain our distribution sources 
we distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels  including independent marketing firms and independent consultants and our employee agents 
these relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits 
in our life insurance segment  we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants 
in our home service insurance segment  we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders 
significant competition exists among insurers to form relationships with marketers of demonstrated ability 
some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms  independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources  better brand recognition  more competitive pricing  lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do 
we compete with other insurers for marketing firms  independent consultants and employee agents primarily on the basis of our compensation and support services 
any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
loss of the services of our senior management team would likely hinder development of our operating and marketing programs and our strategy for expanding our business 
we rely on the active participation of our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  harold e 
riley age  and our vice chairman of the board and president  rick d 
riley age  in connection with the development and execution of our operating and marketing plans and strategy for expanding our business 
we anticipate that their expertise will continue to be of substantial value in connection with our operations 
the loss of the services of either of these individuals could have a significant adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we do not have an employment agreement with either of these persons nor do we carry a key man insurance policy on either of their lives 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the united states  which increases our costs of doing business and could restrict the conduct of our business 
we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in us jurisdictions wherein we do business  as well as anti money laundering regulations adopted under the us patriot act 
insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders  with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies 
to that end  all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad powers under law with respect to such things as licensing companies to transact business  mandating capital and surplus requirements  regulating trade and claims practices  approving policy forms  and restricting companies ability to enter and exit markets 
the capacity for an insurance company s growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus 
maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus  as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company s state of domicile  is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities 
failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for further discussion on statutory capital requirements 
most insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant  renew  suspend and revoke licenses and approvals  and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities  including acquisitions of other insurance companies  require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries  or fine us 
if we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals  or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations  including the us patriot act  our revenues  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

and consolidated subsidiaries changes in us regulation may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and limit our prospective growth 
currently  the us federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business  although initiatives for federal regulation of insurance are proposed by members of the us congress from time to time 
however  federal legislation and administrative policies in several other areas can materially and adversely affect insurance companies  including our business 
these areas include the us patriot act  financial services regulation  securities regulation  including the sarbanes oxley act of  pension regulation  privacy  tort reform legislation and taxation 
in addition  various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time 
our failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business 
we must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences 
if we do not maintain adequate systems  we could experience adverse consequences  including inadequate information on which to base pricing  underwriting and reserve decisions  regulatory problems  failure to meet prompt payment obligations  increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers 
some of our information technology systems and software are mainframe based  legacy type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards 
we continuously enhance and update our systems to keep pace with changes in our products and business models  information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs 
our success is in large part dependent on maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems  as well as continuing to integrate  develop and enhance our information systems to support business processes in a cost effective manner 
our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems  or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our failure to protect confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers  subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations 
we also have legal obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors 
these obligations generally include protecting confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information 
the actions we take to protect confidential information include among other things monitoring our record retention plans and policies and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements  maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records  and limiting access to electronic information in order to safeguard certain information 
in addition  the gramm leach bliley act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of an insurance policy and annually thereafter 
certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements 
however  certain state laws may require us to obtain a policyholder s consent before we share information 
we have a written information security program with appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information 
if we do not comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information  we could experience adverse consequences  including regulatory sanctions  loss of reputation and litigation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the insurance industry in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity  which may negatively impact our financial results 
we interface with and distribute our products to individual consumers 
there may be a perception that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection 
accordingly  from time to time  consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products  thereby subjecting us to periodic negative publicity 
we may also be negatively impacted if other insurance companies engage in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses 
negative publicity may result in lower sales of insurance  lower persistency of our insurance products  increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation  which may further increase our costs of doing business and impede our ability to market our products

our results of operations and financial condition may be materially  adversely affected from time to time by general economic  financial market and political conditions  both in the united states and in the foreign countries where our policy owners reside 
these conditions include economic cycles such as levels of consumer spending  levels of inflation  movements of the financial markets  availability of credit  fluctuations in interest rates  monetary policy or demographics  and legislative and competitive changes 
during periods of economic downturn  such as the one occurring in and  our insureds may choose not to purchase our insurance products  may terminate existing policies  permit policies to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
also  our sales of new insurance policies might decrease 
our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of fees  dividends and other distributions they may make to us 
the inability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations or expand our business 
as a holding company  our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries 
we rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries  principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries  to meet our working capital and other corporate expenses 
the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled  and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and  to a lesser extent  the statutory surplus which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company s state of domicile  future statutory earnings which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and regulatory restrictions 
generally  the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater depending on the state of domicile of the subsidiary s net gain from operations during the preceding year and of the subsidiary s net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities 
except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries  claims of our subsidiaries creditors  including policyholders  have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders 
if any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent  liquidates or otherwise reorganizes  our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation  bankruptcy or winding up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation  bankruptcy or winding up laws 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to debt and equity capital and our cost of capital in seeking to expand our business 
the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility in continuing into in some cases  the markets exerted significant downward pressure on availability of debt and equity capital for certain issuers including short term liquidity and credit capacity 
we believe the availability of debt and equity capital has decreased significantly compared to prior years 
the availability of equity and debt financing to us will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry  our credit capacity  as well as the possibility that investors or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to equity capital for us to seek to expand our business 
as such  we may be forced to delay raising debt or equity capital  or bear an unattractive cost of capital  which could adversely affect our ability to complete any acquisitions and negatively impact profitability of an acquisition

generally  such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing or more of the voting securities of the insurer 
in considering an application to acquire control of an insurer  an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience  competence and financial strength of the applicant  the integrity of the applicant s board of directors and executive officers  the acquirer s plans for the management and operation of the insurer  and any anti competitive results that may arise from the acquisition 
in addition  a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states

and consolidated subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages 
as an insurance provider  we collect premiums in the current period to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders 
our core operations include issuing us dollar denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies predominantly to high net worth  high income foreign residents  located principally in latin america and the pacific rim  through approximately  independent marketing consultants  ordinary whole life insurance policies to middle income households in the midwest and the southern united states through approximately independent marketing consultants  and final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in louisiana  mississippi and arkansas through approximately employee and independent agents in our home service distribution segment 
life insurance 
over the past years  cica and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for us dollar denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies 
traditionally  this market has been concentrated in the top of the population of a country in terms of income and net worth 
in recent years  however  there has been a shift to encompass a broader spectrum of the population  as upper middle classes develop in latin america and the pacific rim 
we make our insurance products available using third party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants 
the number of our producing independent consultants has expanded over the years in this segment to approximately  and we received applications from residents of more than countries outside of the us in historically  the majority of our international business has come from latin america  however  the pacific rim has represented a meaningful source of new business for several years 
through the domestic market of our life insurance segment  we provide ordinary whole life  credit life insurance  and final expense policies to middle income families and individuals in certain markets in the midwest and southern us the majority of our revenues are the result of acquisitions of domestic life insurance company acquisitions since home service insurance 
we provide final expense ordinary life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in louisiana  mississippi and arkansas 
our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders and through networks of funeral homes who collect premium and provide personal policyholder service 
we also realize revenues from our investment portfolio  which is a key component of our operations 
the revenues we collect as premiums from policyholders are invested to ensure future benefit payments under the policy contracts 
life insurance companies earn profits on the investment spread  which reflects the investment income earned on the premiums paid to the insurer between the time of receipt and the time benefits are paid out under policies 
changes in interest rates  changes in economic conditions and volatility in the capital markets can all impact the amount of earnings that we realize from our investment portfolio 
marketplace conditions and trends described below are some of the significant trends affecting the life insurance industry and the possible effects they may have on our future operations 
an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age  we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living products rather than death products  as aging baby boomers will require cash accumulation to provide expenses to meet their lifetime needs 
our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner s later years  while continuously providing a death benefit 

table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries the current worldwide recession and contraction of credit availability has resulted in adverse effects for the life insurance industry  including increased surrender of life insurance policies in force  decreased new life insurance policy sales and increased competition for new life insurance policy sales 
our operations in reflected these adverse developments  and are discusssed further below 
we believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies  due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and recession of  as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies 
we believe this trend should be a benefit to our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider 
many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry 
these events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance 
while we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers  we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future  forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us 
if we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage  either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments

the company believes that new business sales were negatively impacted due to the global recession and policyholder concerns 
endowment sales represented an increased portion of new business sales internationally  as these products have gained in popularity over the past several years 
in addition  most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision  which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums 
the company believes this feature is routinely used by policyholders to keep a policy active  as evidenced by the increase in the policy loan asset balance year over year 

table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries net investment income 
net investment income decreased during to million  compared to million during and million in the decrease resulted from lower investment rates available in on new money investments compared to the prior two years  as well as the significant call activity the company experienced on its overall investment portfolio in the current year  resulting in lower rates on reinvested funds 
we continue to invest in bonds of us government sponsored enterprises  such as federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan mortgage association fhlmc  due to our conservative investment strategy of investing in high quality issuers 
over of total investment income is attributable to the company holdings of fixed maturity securities

in  the company recognized other than temporary impairment write downs of million on its holdings of equity mutual funds 
in addition  we also impaired two bonds due to credit quality  recognizing a realized loss of million 
decrease increase in fair value of warrants 
because the market value of our class a common stock decreased during  we recognized a gain on the decrease in fair value of warrants of million in  compared to a loss of million in and a gain of million in the gain in was directly related to the decrease in the price of our class a common stock 
the warrant liability is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  which projects the future value of the warrants when they expire in july and current accounting standards require the change in the value of the warrant liability be recorded as a component of revenues 
when the liability increases we incur a loss  and when the liability decreases we recognized income 
the warrant liability is not anticipated to have an effect on the company s cash flows  as the company expects the warrants will either be converted into our class a common stock in july  or sooner  at the election of the warrant holders  or expire

commissions decreased slightly during to million from million in and million in commissions were essentially flat all three years  even though premium income was up due to the increase of renewal premiums  which pay a lower commission rate than the rate paid on first year business 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expense 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease compared to primarily related to lower audit and consulting fees 
the increase was due largely to an increase in employee compensation and increased fees for international shipping

amortization amounts increased in to million compared to million in and million in the increase in and was significantly impacted by the amount of policy surrenders that the company experienced in the latter part of and throughout we believe this trend is driven primarily by the negative economy and resulting policyholder uncertainty 
cost of customer relationships acquired and other intangibles 
amortization of cost of customer relationships acquired and other intangibles increased from million in  to million in  and was million in the increase related to the icc acquisition and faster amortization due to the increase in lapses on this new business block  in addition to a full year of amortization related to onlic in the current year compared to two months in federal income tax

commissions 
commissions are a principal operating expense that is paid in relation to sales production

the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case by case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
the company determines other than temporary impairment by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the company s intent to sell the security  or if it is more likely than not that the company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost 
when an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the amount of the other than temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company intends to sell the security or more like than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the other than temporary impairment shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date

based upon our emphasis on investing in fixed maturity securities primarily composed of obligations of us government sponsored corporations and our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other than temporary  management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at december  were not impaired  and no additional other than temporary losses need to be recorded 
gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available for sale amounted to million as of december  and million as of december  this increase was primarily due to a lower interest rate environment  which put downward pricing pressure on the fair values of our us government and agency bonds

reinsurance as is customary among insurance companies  our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite 
a primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and  by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain  to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements 
even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured  our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
we believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus

liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations 
liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources 
the liquidity requirements of our company are met primarily by funds provided from operations 
premium deposits and revenues  investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds  while investment purchases  policy benefits  and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds 
we historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow  but in spfic sold  of bonds because of liquidity needs as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike 
there were no liquidity issues in our investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a table disclosing our contractual obligations 

table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries a primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals 
we include provisions within our insurance policies  such as surrender charges  that help limit and discourage early withdrawals 
since these contractual withdrawals  as well as the level of surrenders experienced  have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  our associated cash outflows have  historically  not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy 
we currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds 
cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs 
cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled investment security maturities  redemptions  and prepayments  which totaled million  million and million in  and these cash flows  for the most part  are reinvested in fixed income securities 
net cash outflows from investment activity totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

stockholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december  the increase was largely due to income earned during the period and conversion of the company s preferred stock to class a common stock 
investments increased to million at december  from million at december  invested assets increased during  due to the increase in fixed income holdings in the company s portfolio resulting from new premium and cash amounts being invested  as cash balances decreased by million from to  and the inclusion of icc 
fixed maturities are categorized as fixed maturities available for sale  which are carried in our consolidated financial statements at fair value and held to maturity  which are carried at amortized cost 
fixed maturities available for sale were of investments at december   and fixed maturities held to maturity were of investments at december  policy loans comprised of invested assets at december  compared to at december  these loans  which are secured by the underlying policy values  have yields ranging from to and maturities that are related to the maturity or termination of the applicable policies 
management believes we maintain adequate liquidity despite the uncertain maturities of these loans 
our cash balances at our primary depositories were significantly in excess of federal deposit insurance corporation coverage at december  and december  management monitors the solvency of all financial institutions in which we have funds to minimize the exposure for loss 
management does not believe we are at significant risk for such a loss 
during  we intend to continue to utilize short term agencies and us treasuries as a cash management tool to minimize excess cash balances 
in the wake of bankruptcy filings by large corporations several years ago  concern was raised regarding the use of certain off balance sheet special purpose entities such as partnerships to hedge or conceal losses related to investment activity 
we do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles  nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engage in speculative activities of any nature  and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions 
the company has no subprime or collateralized debt obligations 
the naic has established minimum capital requirements in the form of risk based capital rbc 
risk based capital factors the type of business written by an insurance company  the quality of its assets  and various other aspects of an insurance company s business to develop a minimum level of capital called authorized control level risk based capital and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles  plus certain investment reserves 
should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk based capital fall below  a series of actions by the affected company would begin 
at december   all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum levels

and consolidated subsidiaries two of our subsidiaries were below the minimum threshold at december  a capital contribution of million was made to spfic by its parent splic during the first quarter of because the ratio fell below 
an additional million contribution was made to spfic by its parent splic in the third quarter of adjustments have been made relative to spfic product profitability  which had a positive impact on operations through the remainder of and are expected to benefit future years 
a capital contribution of million was also made to onlic by its parent cica during the first quarter of when its ratio fell below 
the decline in spfic s capital balance mainly resulted from hurricane losses in and an increase in operating expenses 
the reduction in onlic s capital balance resulted from declines in asset values of preferred and common stock holdings 
the capital contributions made in increased the ratios as anticipated in action plans submitted to the appropriate state insurance departments 
the company received approval from the respective state insurance departments to merge onlic into splic as of october  the capital contributions did not impact the overall consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
parent company liquidity and capital resources we are a holding company and have had minimal operations of our own 
our assets primarily consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
accordingly  our cash flows depend upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments  primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries  cica and splic 
the ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of colorado  cica s state of domicile  and louisiana  security plan s state of domicile  which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company 
we historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs and we do not intend to do so in the future 
critical accounting estimates our critical accounting policies are as follows policy liabilities future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields  dividends on participating business  mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves 
management s judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation 
we continue to use the original assumptions including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits the lock in concept unless a premium deficiency exists 
management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of december  management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended december   and are based upon assumptions  including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation  that do not warrant revision 
the relative stability of these assumptions and management s analysis is discussed below 
deferred policy acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions and policy issuance  underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the production of new business  are deferred 
these deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium recognized to the total premium revenue anticipated  using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits 
we utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance 
the factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period 
the factor method ensures that policies that lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation 
the factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value  provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors 
inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred  the ending asset balance and the annual amortization 
approximately of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions 
the remaining are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new insurance business 
those costs generally include costs related to the production  underwriting and issuance of new business

and consolidated subsidiaries a recoverability test that considers  among other things  actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually 
these annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium for the next years 
the available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated 
the deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions 
the two methods using reasonable assumptions illustrate an early deferred policy acquisition recoverability period 
the two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of our aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs 
management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended december   and limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value 
this belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business  utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing 
cost of customer relationships acquired cost of customer relationships acquired ccra is established when we purchase a block of insurance 
ccra is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits 
we utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance  including a static model and a dynamic model 
inherent in the amortization of ccra are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization 
the assumptions used are based upon interest  mortality and lapses at the time of purchase 
a recoverability test that considers  among other things  actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually 
these annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium for the next thirty years 
the ccra is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions 
management believes that our ccra and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended december   and this belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing 
goodwill current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be review for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment 
most of the company s reporting units  for which goodwill has been allocated  are equivalent to the company s operating segment  as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process as defined under current accounting guidance 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations  peer company price to earnings multiples  the level of the company s class a common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit 
other assumptions can include levels of economic capital  future business growth  and earnings projections 
valuation of investments in fixed maturity and equity securities the evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition or future prospects  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period 

table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries based upon current accounting guidance  investment securities must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase 
the classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
fixed maturity securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity 
securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with the unrealized holding gains and losses  net of tax  reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized 
the company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations  for determining if an otti exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines 
in evaluating the possible impairment of securities  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial conditions and near term prospects of the issuer  and the ability and intent of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  the company may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  by government sponsored agencies  or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
if management determines that an investment experienced an otti  management must then determine the amount of otti to be recognized in earnings 
if management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of otti related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
if management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the otti will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain as other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold 
the company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset liability management decisions  future market movements  business plan changes  or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time 
premium revenue and related expenses premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or  for short duration contracts  over the contract period on a pro rata basis 
benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts 
this matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments 
our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges 
tax accounting a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that is more likely than not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit 
these determinations inherently involves management s judgment 
in addition  the company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized 
this valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset 
management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and capital position
