item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and overview as of december   we managed our portfolio within six geographic segments pennsylvania  metropolitan washington d 
c  new jersey delaware  richmond  virginia  austin  texas and california 
the pennsylvania segment includes properties in chester  delaware  bucks  and montgomery counties in the philadelphia suburbs and the city of philadelphia in pennsylvania 
the metropolitan washington  dc segment includes properties in northern virginia and suburban maryland 
the new jersey delaware segment includes properties in burlington  camden and mercer counties and counties in the southern and central part of new jersey and in new castle county in the state of delaware 
the richmond  virginia segment includes properties primarily in albemarle  chesterfield  goochland and henrico counties and durham  north carolina 
the california segment includes properties in oakland  concord  carlsbad and rancho bernardo 
the austin  texas segment includes properties in austin and coppell 
we generate cash and revenue from leases of space at our properties and  to a lesser extent  from the management of properties owned by third parties and from investments in the real estate ventures 
factors that we evaluate when leasing space include rental rates  costs of tenant improvements  tenant creditworthiness  current and expected operating costs  the length of the lease  vacancy levels and demand for office and industrial space 
we also generate cash through sales of assets  including assets that we do not view as core to our portfolio  either because of location or expected growth potential  and assets that are commanding premium prices from third party investors 
factors that may influence future results of operations global market and economic conditions in the us  recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability and the ability of our tenants  to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
real estate asset valuation general economic conditions and the resulting impact on market conditions or a downturn in tenants businesses may adversely affect the value of our assets 
periods of economic slowdown or recession in the us  declining demand for leased office  mixed use  or industrial properties and or a decrease in market rental rates and or market values of real estate assets in our submarkets could have a negative impact on the value of our assets  including the value of our properties and related tenant improvements 
if we were required under gaap to write down the carrying value of any of our properties to the lower of cost or fair value due to impairment  or if as a result of an early lease termination we were required to remove or dispose of material amounts of tenant improvements that are not reusable to another tenant  our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected 
leasing activity and rental rates the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space  newly developed or redeveloped properties and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in our submarkets 
negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods 

table of contents development and redevelopment programs historically  a significant portion of our growth has come from our development and redevelopment efforts 
we have a proactive planning process by which we continually evaluate the size  timing  costs and scope of our development and redevelopment programs and  as necessary  scale activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our strategic submarkets 
given the economic conditions  we do not intend to commence new development or redevelopment projects in the near future 
we believe that our current capital plan allows for us to continue the development and redevelopment projects that are currently underway 
we believe that a portion of our future potential growth will continue to come from our newly developed or redeveloped properties once current economic conditions normalize 
however  we anticipate that the general economic conditions and the resulting impact on conditions in our core markets will delay timing and reduce the scope of our development program in the near future  which will further impact the average development and redevelopment asset balances qualifying for interest and other carry cost capitalization 
we cease capitalizing such costs once a project does not qualify for interest and other carry cost capitalization under gaap 
in addition  we may be unable to lease committed development or redevelopment properties at expected rental rates or within projected timeframes or complete development or redevelopment properties on schedule or within budgeted amounts  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
financial and operating performance our financial and operating performance is dependent upon the demand for office  industrial and other commercial space in our markets  our leasing results  our acquisition  disposition and development activity  our financing activity  our cash requirements and economic and market conditions  including prevailing interest rates 
in seeking to increase revenue through our operating  financing and investment activities  we also seek to minimize operating risks  including i tenant rollover risk  ii tenant credit risk and iii development risk 
tenant rollover risk we are subject to the risk that tenant leases  upon expiration  are not renewed  that space may not be relet  or that the terms of renewal or reletting including the cost of renovations may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms 
leases accounting for approximately of our aggregate final annualized base rents as of december  representing approximately of the net rentable square feet of the properties expire without penalty in we maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to maximize lease renewals 
our retention rate for leases that were scheduled to expire in was 
if we are unable to renew leases or relet space under expiring leases  at anticipated rental rates  or if tenants terminate their leases early  our cash flow would be adversely impacted 
tenant credit risk in the event of a tenant default  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
our management regularly evaluates our accounts receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions 
our accounts receivable allowance was million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  compared to million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  if economic conditions persist or deteriorate further  we may experience increases in past due accounts  defaults  lower occupancy and reduced effective rents 
this condition would negatively affect our future net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
development risk at december   we were proceeding on two developments and three redevelopments sites aggregating million square feet with total projected costs of million of which million remained to be funded 
these amounts include million of total project costs for the combined th street post office pre leased to the internal revenue service and cira south garage pre leased to the internal revenue service in philadelphia  pennsylvania of which million remained to be funded at december  we are also finishing the lease up of eight recently completed developments for which we expect to spend an additional million in we are actively marketing space at these projects to prospective tenants but can provide no assurance as to the timing or terms of any leases of space at these projects 

table of contents as of december   we owned approximately acres of undeveloped land 
when the market recovers  we will look to opportunistically dispose of those parcels that we do not anticipate developing 
for the parcels of land that we ultimately develop  we would be subject to risks associated with development of this land including construction cost increases or overruns and construction delays  insufficient occupancy rates  building moratoriums and inability to obtain necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental approvals 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on the straight line basis from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to existing leases  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
lease incentives  which are included as reductions of rental revenue are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs 
for certain leases in the portfolio  there are significant assumptions and judgments made by management in determining the lease term such as when termination options are provided to the tenant 
the lease term impacts the period over which minimum rents are determined and recorded and also considers the period over which lease related costs are amortized 
in addition  our rental revenue is impacted by our determination of whether the improvements made by us or the tenant are landlord assets 
the determination of whether an asset is a landlord asset requires judgment and principally considers whether improvements would be utilizable by another tenant upon move out by the existing tenant 
to the extent they are determined not to be landlord assets  and we fund them  they are considered as lease incentives 
to the extent the tenant funds the improvements that we consider to be landlord assets  we treat them as deferred revenue which is amortized to revenue over the lease term 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost 
we record acquisition of real estate investments under the purchase method of accounting and allocate the purchase price to land  buildings and intangible assets on a relative fair value basis 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful lives of buildings and capital improvements to years and over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset for tenant improvements 
direct construction costs related to the development of properties and land holdings are capitalized as incurred 
capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development and constructions costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  salaries and other project costs during the period of development 
estimates and judgments are required in determining when capitalization of certain costs such as interest should commence and cease 
we expense routine repair and maintenance expenditures and capitalize those items that extend the useful lives of the underlying assets 
real estate ventures when we obtain an economic interest in an entity  we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity vie  and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  in accordance with the accounting standard for the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this accounting standard requires significant use of judgments and estimates in determining its application 
if the entity is not deemed to be a vie  and we serve as the general partner within the entity  we evaluate to determine if our presumed control as the general partner is overcome by the kick out rights and other substantive participating rights of the limited partners in accordance with same accounting standard 

table of contents we consolidate i entities that are vies and of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we control 
entities that we account for under the equity method ie  at cost  increased or decreased by our share of earnings or losses  less distributions include i entities that are vies and of which we are not deemed the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we do not control  but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence 
we will reconsider our determination of whether an entity is a vie and who the primary beneficiary is if events occur that are likely to cause a change in the original determinations 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
our estimates of value for each investment particularly in commercial real estate joint ventures are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and operating costs 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  accordingly  the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the long lived asset s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of the investments in long lived assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
there were also operating properties evaluated as they have been identified for potential sale 
no impairment was determined  however  if actual cashflows or the estimated holding periods change  an impairment could be recorded in the future and it could be material 
although our strategy is generally to hold our properties over the long term  we will dispose of properties to meet our liquidity needs or for other strategic needs 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
where properties have been identified as having a potential for sale  additional judgments are required related to the determination as to the appropriate period over which the undiscounted cash flows should include the operating cash flows and the amount included as the estimated residual value 
management determines the amounts to be included based on a probability weighted cash flow 
this requires significant judgment 
in some cases  the results of whether an impairment is indicated are sensitive to changes in assumptions input into the estimates  including the hold period until expected sale 
at december   we performed an impairment assessment of our land holdings as management determined that a sale scenario was the most likely source of future cash flows for certain of the land parcels aggregating to total cost of million which is included in land inventory 
this impairment assessment required management to estimate the expected proceeds from sale at some point in the future  to determine whether an impairment was indicated 
this estimate requires significant judgment 
if our expectations as to the expected sales proceeds  or timing of the anticipated sale change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment could be different and such differences could be material 
during the first quarter of  we determined that one of our properties  during our testing for impairment under the held and used model  had a historical cost greater than the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  an impairment on the property of million was recorded to reduce its carrying value to an amount based on management s estimate of the current fair value 
this property was sold in the second quarter 
we also recorded an impairment on properties designated as held for sale at june  of million  these properties were sold during the last quarter of during our impairment review for the remaining part of  it was determined that no additional impairment charges were necessary 

table of contents income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in addition  we have several subsidiary reits 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we and each of our reit subsidiaries are required to  among other things  distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets 
as reits  we and our reit subsidiaries are not subject to federal income tax with respect to the portion of our income that meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to the stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the operations of these reits 
we and our reit subsidiaries intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as reits 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we or one of our reit subsidiaries were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax 
we may elect to treat one or more of our subsidiaries as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
in general  a trs may perform additional services for our tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person  under a franchise  license or otherwise  of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated 
a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax 
we have elected to treat certain of our corporate subsidiaries as trss  these entities provide third party property management services and certain services to tenants that could not otherwise be provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents an estimate of losses that may be incurred from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
the allowance is an estimate based on two calculations that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have determined that a tenant may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these situations  we use our judgment  based on the facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that tenant against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to collect 
these reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
second  a reserve is established for all tenants based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
deferred costs we incur direct costs related to the financing  development and leasing of our properties 
management exercises judgment in determining whether such costs  particularly internal costs  meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed 
capitalized financing fees are amortized over the related loan term and capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related lease term 
management re evaluates the remaining useful lives of leasing costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants and economic and market conditions change 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on fair values 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancellable term of the lease 
capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases 
capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases  including any fixed rate renewal periods 

table of contents other intangible assets also include amounts representing the value of tenant relationships and in place leases based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
we estimate the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in place leases  include leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
this intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases 
we estimate fair value through methods similar to those used by independent appraisers or by using independent appraisals 
factors that we consider in our analysis include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from three to twelve months 
characteristics that we consider in allocating value to our tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our business relationship with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized over the remaining initial lease term and expected renewals  but in no event longer than the remaining depreciable life of the building 
the value of in place leases is amortized over the remaining non cancellable term of the respective leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
in the event that a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of each intangible  including market rate adjustments  in place lease values and tenant relationship values  would be charged to expense 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same store property portfolio and the total portfolio 
the same store property portfolio consists of properties containing an aggregate of approximately million net rentable square feet that we owned for the entire twelve month periods ended december  and this table also includes a reconciliation from the same store property portfolio to the total portfolio net income ie  all properties owned by us during the twelve month periods ended december  and by providing information for the properties which were acquired  under development including lease up assets or placed into service and administrative elimination information for the twelve month periods ended december  and in thousands 
the total portfolio net income presented in the table is equal to the net income of brandywine realty trust 
the only difference between the reported net income of brandywine realty trust and brandywine operating partnership is the allocation of the non controlling interest attributable to continuing and discontinued operations for limited partnership units that is on the statement of operations for brandywine realty trust

table of contents total revenue cash rents from the total portfolio increased by million from to  primarily reflecting an additional million from four development redevelopment properties that we completed and placed in service subsequent to an additional million of rental income due to increased occupancy at nine development redevelopment properties in in comparison to the increase was offset by the decrease of million of rental income at our same store properties from to due to a decrease in occupancy of basis points 
straight line rents at the total portfolio decreased by million primarily due to free rent converting to cash rent during tenant reimbursements increased by million from to primarily due to the increase in property operating expenses at our same store portfolio 
tenant reimbursements increased by million at our same store portfolio and the property operating expenses including real estate taxes at those properties increased by million 
the decrease in termination fees of million from to is mainly due to the recognition of a million termination fee from one tenant during in comparison to a million termination fee received from one tenant at one of redevelopment properties and a million termination fee received from one tenant at one of our same store properties in third party management fees  labor reimbursement and leasing decreased by million from to as a result of the termination of the management fee contract on march  that we entered into when we sold the office properties located in reading and harrisburg  pa 
as the contract was terminated early  approximately million of unamortized deferred management fees were taken into income during the decrease also resulted from the termination of other third party management contracts totaling million square feet subsequent to property operating expenses property operating expenses  including real estate taxes  at the total portfolio increased by million due to increased repairs and maintenance expenses along with increased snow removal expenses during compared to we also incurred an additional million of expenses from four properties that we completed and placed in service subsequent to these increases were offset by a decrease in the bad debt expense of million from to general administrative expenses general administrative expenses decreased by million from to mainly due to the severance costs of million in that we did not have in depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased by million from to  primarily due to million of depreciation and amortization expense recorded on the four properties completed and placed in service subsequent to an additional million of depreciation and amortization expense was recorded on portions of the nine development properties that were placed in service subsequent to the increase was offset by the decrease of million at the same store portfolio for asset write offs related to early move outs and fully amortized assets when comparing to 
table of contents interest income expense interest income increased by approximately million mainly due to the accretion of the million interest free note receivable from the sale of the five northern california properties in the fourth quarter of the note receivable was recorded at its present value on the date of sale of million 
during  we recognized million of interest income related to this note receivable and million of interest income related to the million note receivable from the sale of the two trenton properties during the fourth quarter of during  we recognized million of interest income related to the note receivable from the sale of the five northern california properties and million of interest income received from a certificate of deposit investment 
the decrease in interest expense of million is mainly due to the following decrease of million resulting from the payoff at maturity of our million private placement notes in december decrease of million resulting from a lower average credit facility balance at the end of and a lower weighted average interest rate on such borrowings in compared to december  decrease of million resulting from lower weighted average interest rates on our million bank term loan and our three preferred trust borrowings 
such borrowings have variable interest rates and a portion of such borrowings are swapped to fixed rate debt through our hedging program 
this decrease is offset by an increase of million paid under these hedges since the variable interest rates on such debt is lower than the swapped fixed rate on the hedges assigned to these borrowings 
decrease of million resulting from our buybacks of unsecured notes in the details of the repurchases completed during the twelve months ended december  and are noted in the gain on early extinguishment of debt section below 
this decrease is offset by an increase of million of interest on issuance of new notes 
the above explained net decrease of million is offset by a decrease in capitalized interest of million as a result of the decrease in the average balance  on open development and redevelopment projects  million of interest expense related to our tax credit transactions  and an increase of million from a higher outstanding mortgage notes payable balance as of december  compared to december  amortization of deferred financing costs increased by million due to the acceleration of such expenses incurred in the debt repurchase activities of provision for impairment on land inventory as part of our review of long lived assets in accordance with the accounting standard for long lived assets  during the quarter ending december   management determined that certain of the parcels in our land inventory considered at that time more likely to be sold had historical carrying values in excess of the current estimate of their fair value 
our impairment was recorded based on management s estimate of the current fair value of the land inventory at that time 
provision for impairment on real estate during the quarter ended march  impairment review  we determined that one of the properties tested for impairment under the held and used model had a historical cost greater than the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  the recorded amount was reduced to an amount based on management s estimate of the current fair value 
during the nine months period ended september   we recorded a provision of million for impairment relating to the sale of the five northern california properties classifies as held for sale 

table of contents where properties have been identified as having a potential for sale  additional judgments are required related to the determination as to the appropriate period over which the undiscounted cash flows should include the operating cash flows and the amount included as the estimated residual value 
management determines the amounts to be included based on a probability weighted cash flow 
this requires significant judgment 
in some cases  the results of whether an impairment is indicated are sensitive to changes in assumptions input into the estimates  including the hold period until expected sale 
recognized hedge activity during  we recorded a million mark to market adjustment relating to two of our swaps that were applied to our offering of million senior unsecured notes due completed in september the swaps no longer qualified for hedge accounting upon completion of this offering as the hedging relationship was terminated 
accordingly  the changes in the fair value of the swaps were reflected in our statement of operations until they were cash settled in december we paid million to terminate these swaps 
during the year  we also recorded a net million of income related to the write off of aoci and the ineffective portion of certain of our hedges 
equity in income of real estate ventures the decrease in equity in income of real estate venture from to was mainly due to a payout of million that we received for our interest in a real estate venture that was sold during the fourth quarter of the remainder of the decrease is primarily attributable to lower net income at the real estate venture properties 
gain on early extinguishment of debt during  we repurchased million of our million exchangeable notes  million of our million guaranteed notes due  million of our million guaranteed notes due  million of our million guaranteed notes due and million of our million guaranteed notes due which resulted in a net gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 
the gain on early extinguishment of debt is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect our adoption of the new accounting standard for convertible debt instruments 
during  we repurchased million of our million guaranteed exchangeable notes  million of our million guaranteed notes due and million of our million guaranteed notes due which resulted in an million gain that we reported for the early extinguishment of debt 
the gain on extinguishment of debt has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our adoption of the new accounting standard for convertible debt instruments 
discontinued operations during the twelve month period ended december   we sold two properties in exton  pa  one property in moorestown  nj  one property in bethesda  md  two properties in trenton  nj and a condominium unit and an undivided interest in an office building in lawrenceville  nj 
these properties had total revenue of million  operating expenses of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million and gain on sale of million 
we determined that the sale of the two properties in trenton  nj should be accounted for using the installment sale method 
as a result  we deferred the portion of the gain which exceeded the calculated gain following the installment sale method 
these amounts will decrease in proportion with the paydown of the principal balance on our note receivable from the buyer of the properties 
the buyer is not obligated to make any principal payments over the next seven years 
if they do make principal payments in advance  a portion of these amounts that are deferred will be recognized as a gain on sale in the period that we receive the cash for the principal payments 
we also recorded a million loss provision during the first quarter of in connection with the property in bethesda  md sold during the second quarter of which reduced our income from discontinued operations 

table of contents the december  amounts are reclassified to include the operations of the properties sold during the twelve months period ended december   as well as all properties that were sold through the year ended december  therefore  the discontinued operations amount for the twelve months period ended december  includes total revenue of million  operating expenses of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  interest expense of million and gains on sale of million 
we also recorded a million loss provision in connection with the five northern california properties classified as held for sale during the second quarter of which reduced our income from discontinued operations 
net income net income decreased by million from the twelve month period ended december  as a result of the factors described above 
net income is significantly impacted by depreciation of operating properties and amortization of acquired intangibles 
these non cash charges do not directly affect our ability to pay dividends 
such charges can be expected to continue until lease intangibles are fully amortized 
these intangibles are amortizing over the related lease terms or estimated duration of the tenant relationship 
earnings per common share loss per share basic and diluted were for the twelve month period ended december  as compared to earnings per share of for the twelve month period ended december  as a result of the factors described above and an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding 
the increase in the average number of common shares outstanding is primarily the result of a million public equity offering of  shares during the second quarter of

an additional million from six properties that we acquired and ten development redevelopment properties that we completed and placed in service subsequent to an additional million of rental income due to increased occupancy at eight development redevelopment properties in in comparison to the increase was offset by the decrease of million of rental income earned from our g i properties during tenant reimbursements increased by million from to primarily due to the increase in property operating expenses at our same store portfolio 
tenant reimbursements increased by million at our same store portfolio and the property operating expenses at those properties increased by million 
these increases are offset by the activity of the g i properties during third party management fees  labor reimbursement and leasing increased by million from to as a result of a greater number of properties that we are managing for third parties 
the g i properties make up a significant portion of the increase in the number of properties that we manage for third parties 
property operating expenses property operating expenses  including real estate taxes and third party management expenses  at the total portfolio decreased by million from to  primarily due to million of such expenses for the g i properties in the decrease was offset by million of property operating expenses and real estate taxes from six properties that we acquired and ten development redevelopment properties that we completed and placed in service subsequent to property operating expenses and real estate taxes at our same store portfolio and our eight development redevelopment properties also increased by million and million  respectively  from to depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization decreased by million from to  primarily due to million of depreciation and amortization expense recorded on the g i properties during in addition  depreciation and amortization decreased by million at our same store portfolio due to assets within the same store portfolio being fully amortized subsequent to general administrative expenses general administrative expenses decreased by million from to of which approximately million was a result of the final determination of bonus awards to our executive management  thereby resulting in a reduction to the estimated payout that was accrued during we incurred million of severance costs in and million of severance costs in these measures and other corporate level cost saving strategies resulted in the remainder of the decrease from the prior year 
interest income expense the decrease in interest income by approximately million is due to lower cash balances during the period ended december  
table of contents interest expense decreased by million primarily due to lower mortgage notes payable outstanding during the year ending december  in comparison to december  as a result of certain mortgage notes payable being paid off subsequent to the decrease is also the result of a lower outstanding balance and lower weighted average interest rate on credit facility borrowings during in comparison to loss on settlement of treasury lock agreements in july  in anticipation of an expected debt offering  we entered into four treasury lock agreements 
the treasury lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges on interest rate risk and qualified for hedge accounting 
the agreements were settled on september   the original termination date of each agreement  at a total cost of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the planned debt issuance was remote and recorded million as an expense for the residual balance of million 
no such settlement occurred during the year ending december  provision for impairment on land inventory as part of our review of long lived assets in accordance with the related requirements provided under the accounting standard for long lived assets  during the quarter ending december   management determined that certain of the parcels in our land inventory had historical carrying values in excess of the current estimate of their fair value 
our impairment was recorded based on management s estimate of the current fair value of the land inventory 
gain on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we repurchased million of our million guaranteed exchangeable notes  million of our million guaranteed notes due and million of our million guaranteed notes due which resulted in a million gain that we reported for the early extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we accelerated amortization of the related deferred financing costs of million 
we also reduced gain on early extinguishment of debt by million resulting from the retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for convertible debt 
discontinued operations during the twelve month period ended december   we sold one property in allentown  pa  one property in mount laurel  nj  one property in newtown  pa  five properties in oakland  ca and one property in richmond  va 
these properties had total revenue of million  operating expenses of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million and minority interest attributable to discontinued operations of million 
we also recorded a million provision for impairment in connection with the five properties in oakland  ca which reduced our income from discontinued operations 
the december  amount is reclassified to include the operations of the properties sold during the twelve month period ended december   as well as the properties that were sold during the year ended december  therefore  the discontinued operations amount for the twelve month period ended december  includes sold properties with total revenue of million  operating expenses of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and minority interest attributable to discontinued operations of million 

table of contents net income net income decreased by million from the twelve month period ended december  as a result of the factors described above 
net income is significantly impacted by depreciation of operating properties and amortization of acquired intangibles 
these non cash charges do not directly affect our ability to pay dividends 
such charges can be expected to continue until the lease intangibles are fully amortized 
these intangibles are amortizing over the related lease terms or estimated duration of the tenant relationship 
earnings per common share earnings per share basic and diluted were for the twelve month period ended december  as compared to for the twelve month period ended december  as a result of the factors described above and an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding 
the increase in the average number of common shares outstanding is the result of a partnership unit conversion to common shares during and the issuance of common shares upon the vesting of restricted common shares 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are as follows fund normal recurring expenses  fund capital expenditures  including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund repayment of certain debt instruments when they mature  fund current development and redevelopment costs  and fund distributions declared by our board of trustees 
we believe that with the general downturn in the economy  it is reasonably likely that vacancy rates may continue to increase  effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may continue to decrease and tenant installation costs  including concessions  may continue to increase in most or all of our markets in and possibly beyond 
as a result of the potential negative effects on our revenue from the overall reduced demand for office space  our cash flow could be insufficient to cover increased tenant installation costs over the short term 
if this situation were to occur  we expect that we would finance any shortfalls through borrowings under our credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through cash flows generated by operations  financing activities and selective property sales 
rental revenue  expense recoveries from tenants  and other income from operations are our principal sources of cash that we use to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification 
we seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
our revenue also includes third party fees generated by our property management  leasing  developments and construction businesses 
we believe our revenue  together with proceeds from property sales and secured debt financings  will continue to provide funds for our short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in our operating or financing activities may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations would affect the financial performance covenants under our unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes 
financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty 
liquidity has generally tightened in all financial markets  including the debt and equity markets 
our liquidity management remains a top priority 
our ability to fund development projects  as well as our ability to repay or refinance debt maturities could be adversely affected by an inability to secure financing at reasonable terms beyond those already completed in it is possible  in these unusual and uncertain times that one or more lenders in our revolving credit facility could fail to fund a borrowing request 
such an event could adversely affect our ability to access funds from its revolving credit facility when needed 
we pursued new financing opportunities to ensure an appropriate balance sheet position through as a result of these efforts  we are comfortable with our ability to meet future debt maturities and development funding needs 
we believe that our current balance sheet and outlook for are in an adequate position at the date of this filing  despite the ongoing disruption in the credit markets 
the following are our significant activities during affecting our liquidity management on april   we closed on an million first mortgage financing on our two logan square property 
the new loan bears interest at per annum and has a seven year term with three years of interest only payments with principal payments based on a thirty year amortization schedule 
we used million in net proceeds to repay without penalty the balance of the former two logan square first mortgage loan and million for general corporate purposes including the repayment of existing indebtedness 

table of contents on june   we completed the public offering of  of our common shares  par value per share 
the common shares were issued and sold to the underwriters at a public offering price of per common share in accordance with an underwriting agreement 
the common shares sold include  shares issued and sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise in full of their over allotment option under the underwriting agreement 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering net of underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses 
we used the net proceeds from the offering to repay our million unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
on june   we entered into a forward financing commitment to borrow up to million under two separate loans at a per annum interest rate of 
the loans  when funded  will be secured by mortgages on the th street post office the post office project  the cira south garage the garage project projects and by the leases of space at these facilities upon the completion of these projects 
of the total borrowings  million and million will be allocated to the post office project and to the garage project  respectively 
in order for funding to occur we need to meet certain conditions which primarily relate to the completion of the projects and the commencement of the rental payments from the respective leases on these properties 
on july   we closed on a million first mortgage financing on our one logan square property 
the new loan bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus basis points subject to a libor floor and has a seven year term with three years of interest only payments with principal payments based on a thirty year amortization schedule at a rate 
we used the loan proceeds for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness 
on september   we consummated a registered public offering of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes due the notes were priced at of their face amount with a yield to maturity of  representing a spread at the time of pricing of to the yield on the august treasury note 
the notes have been reflected net of discount of million in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the net proceeds which amounted to million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses will be used to repay our indebtedness under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
in december  we received the second contribution under the historic tax credit transaction that we entered into in with us bancorp amounting to million 
during  we sold seven properties containing million in net rentable square feet for net cash proceeds of million 
we will also consider other properties within our portfolio where it may be in our best interest to obtain a secured mortgage 
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs 
we use our credit facility for general business purposes  including the acquisition  development and redevelopment of properties and the repayment of other debt 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our credit ratings  the value of our unencumbered assets  our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders 
if more than one rating agency were to downgrade our credit rating  our access to capital in the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under our existing credit facility and term loan would increase 
our ability to sell common and preferred shares is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of our shares 
we regularly analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time 

table of contents we will also consider sales of selected properties as another source of managing our liquidity 
asset sales during and have been a source of cash 
since mid  we have used proceeds from asset sales to repay existing indebtedness  provide capital for our development activities and strengthen our financial condition 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise similar or even lesser amounts of capital from future asset sales 
cash flows the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statement of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements and is not meant to be an all inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented 
as of december  and  we maintained cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
this million decrease was the result of the following changes in cash flow from our various activities activity operating investing financing net cash flows our principal source of cash flows is from the operation of our properties 
we do not restate our cash flow for discontinued operations 
the net decrease in cash flows from operating activities is primarily the result of the following decrease in average occupancy from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december   decrease in the number of operating properties due to dispositions 
we sold a total of seven properties during the year ended december   these decreases are offset by the receipt of the second contribution under the historic tax credit transaction that we entered into in with us bancorp amounting to million  and timing of cash receipts from our tenants and cash expenditures in the normal course of operations 
the cash flows used in investing activities is primarily attributable to the following our capital expenditures for tenant and building improvements and leasing commissions increased by million during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   net proceeds from sales of properties during the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the year ended december   and receipt of funds placed in escrow during the last quarter of related to the cira garage project amounting to million which was also used to finance the project this year 
the net decrease in cash used in financing activities is mainly due to the following net proceeds received from the public offering of common shares amounting to million 
decrease in our distributions paid to shareholders and non controlling interests from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  
table of contents during the year ended december   we also obtained a total of million first mortgage financings on our one logan and two logan square office properties located in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
completion of a registered public offering of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes due we received million in net proceeds from this offering after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
increase in the net activity of our credit facility and unsecured notes of million during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  repayments of mortgage notes payable also increased from million during year ended december  to million during the year ended december  in addition  deferred financing costs paid also increased during the year ended december  by million when compared to the year ended december  and primarily relate to the payment of a million forward financing commitment fee  the remainder relates to costs incurred for other borrowings closed during the year 
capitalization indebtedness during the year ended december   we repurchased million of our unsecured notes in a series of transactions which are summarized in the table below repurchase deferred financing notes amount principal gain amortization notes notes notes notes notes the operating partnership is the issuer of our unsecured notes and brandywine realty trust has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the notes

the notes have been reflected net of discount of million in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the net proceeds which amounted to million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses will be used to repay our indebtedness under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
on july   we closed on a million first mortgage financing on our one logan square property 
the new loan bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus basis points subject to a libor floor and has a seven year term with three years of interest only payments with principal payments based on a thirty year amortization schedule at a rate 
we used the loan proceeds for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness 
on april   we closed on an million first mortgage financing on our two logan square property 
the new loan bears interest at per annum and has a seven year term with three years of interest only payments with principal payments based on a thirty year amortization schedule 
we used million in net proceeds to repay without penalty the balance of the former two logan square first mortgage loan and million for general corporate purposes including the repayment of existing indebtedness 

table of contents on april   we exercised the accordion feature on our million unsecured term loan which we entered into in october and borrowed an additional million  bringing our total outstanding balance to million 
all outstanding borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a periodic rate of libor plus basis points 
the net proceeds of the term loan increase were used to reduce indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
the term loan matures on october  and may be extended at our option for two one year periods but not beyond the maturity date of our revolving credit facility 
on june   we amended our million unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility 
the amendment extended the maturity date of the credit facility from december  to june  subject to an extension of one year  at our option  upon our payment of an extension fee equal to basis points of the committed amount under the credit facility 
the amendment also reduced the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding balances from libor plus to libor plus per annum 
in addition  the amendment reduced the quarterly facility fee from basis points to basis points per annum 
the interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment upon a change in our unsecured debt ratings 
the amendment also lowered to from the capitalization rate used in the calculation of several of the financial covenants  increased our swing loan availability from million to million  and increased the number of competitive bid loan requests available to us from two to four in any day period 
borrowings are always available to the extent of borrowing capacity at the stated rates  however  the competitive bid feature allows banks that are part of the lender consortium under the credit facility to bid to make loans to us at a reduced eurodollar rate 
we have the option to increase the credit facility to million subject to the absence of any defaults and our ability to acquire additional commitments from our existing lenders or new lenders 
on april   we consummated the public offering of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured guaranteed notes due and used the net proceeds from this offering to reduce borrowings under the credit facility 
in april  the entered into a million sweep agreement the sweep agreement to be used for cash management purposes 
borrowings under the sweep agreement bear interest at one month libor plus 
the sweep agreement ended in april at which point the agreement was not renewed 

table of contents as of december   we had approximately billion of outstanding indebtedness

we use credit facility borrowings for general business purposes  including the acquisition  development and redevelopment of properties and the repayment of other debt 
we have an option to increase the maximum borrowings under the credit facility to million subject to the absence of any defaults and our ability to obtain additional commitments from our existing or new lenders 
our interest rate incurred under our revolving credit facility and term loan is subject to modification depending on our rating status with qualified agencies 
as of december   we had million of borrowings  million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility  and a million holdback in connection with our historic tax credit transaction leaving million of unused availability 
for the years ended december  and  our weighted average interest rates  including the effects of interest rate hedges discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein  and including both the new credit facility and prior credit facility  were and per annum  respectively 
the credit facility contains financial and non financial covenants  including covenants that relate to our incurrence of additional debt  the granting of liens  consummation of mergers and consolidations  the disposition of assets and interests in subsidiaries  the making of loans and investments  and the payment of dividends 
the restriction on dividends permits us to pay dividends to the greater of i an amount required for us to retain our qualification as a reit and ii of our funds from operations 
the credit facility also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain an interest coverage ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  an unsecured debt ratio and an unencumbered cash flow ratio above certain specified minimum levels  to maintain net worth above an amount determined on a specified formula  and to maintain a leverage ratio and a secured debt ratio below certain maximum levels 
another financial covenant limits the ratio of unsecured debt to unencumbered properties 
we continuously monitor the company s compliance with and anticipated compliance with the covenants 
certain of the covenants restrict management s ability to obtain alternative sources of capital 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  
table of contents the indenture under which we issued our unsecured notes including those issued in september contain or contained financial covenants  including a leverage ratio not to exceed  a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed  a debt service coverage ratio of greater than to and an unencumbered asset value of not less than of unsecured debt 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  we have mortgage loans that are collateralized by certain of our properties 
payments on mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest  or interest only 
we intend to refinance or repay our mortgage loans as they mature through the use of proceeds from selective property sales and secured or unsecured borrowings 
however  in the current and future economic environment one or more of these sources may not be available on attractive terms or at all 
our charter documents do not limit the amount or form of indebtedness that we may incur  and our policies on debt incurrence are solely within the discretion of our board  subject to financial covenants in the credit facility  indenture and other credit agreements 
as of december   we had guaranteed repayment of approximately million of loans on behalf of certain real estate ventures 
see item properties real estate ventures 
we also provide customary environmental indemnities and completion guarantees in connection with construction and permanent financing both for our own account and on behalf of certain of the real estate ventures 
share repurchases we maintain a share repurchase program under which our board has authorized us to repurchase our common shares from time to time 
our board initially authorized this program in and has periodically replenished capacity under the program  including  most recently  on may  when our board restored capacity to million common shares 
we did not repurchase any shares during under this plan 
as of december   we may repurchase an additional million shares under the plan 
our board has not limited the duration of the program  however  it may be terminated at any time 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not dependent on any off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
our off balance sheet arrangements are discussed in note to the financial statements  investment in unconsolidated real estate ventures 
additional information about the debt of our unconsolidated real estate ventures is included in item properties 
short and long term liquidity we believe that our cash flow from operations is adequate to fund our short term liquidity requirements  excluding principal payments under our debt obligations 
cash flow from operations is generated primarily from rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements from tenants and management services income from providing services to third parties 
we intend to use these funds to meet short term liquidity needs  which are to fund operating expenses  recurring capital expenditures  tenant allowances  leasing commissions  interest expense and the minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code 
we expect to meet short term scheduled debt maturities through borrowings under the credit facility and proceeds from selective asset dispositions 
as of december   we had  million of unsecured debt and million of mortgage debt of which million and million  respectively  are scheduled to mature through december we expect to extend our term loan of million  we expect to have sufficient capacity under our credit facility and for the remaining debt maturities  and we will also continue to look to the other listed sources to fund these maturities 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as for property acquisitions  development  investments in real estate ventures  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other significant capital improvements  through cash from operations  borrowings under the credit facility  additional secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of equity securities  contributions from joint venture investors and proceeds from asset dispositions 

table of contents many commercial real estate lenders have substantially tightened underwriting standards or have withdrawn from the lending marketplace 
also  spreads in the investment grade bond market have substantially widened 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets  making financing terms less attractive  and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
as a result  we expect debt financings will be more difficult to obtain and that borrowing costs on new and refinanced debt will be more expensive 
moreover  the recent volatility in the financial markets  in general  will make it more difficult or costly  or even impossible  for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or other equity instruments or through public issuances of debt securities from our shelf registration statements as we have been able to do in the past 
such conditions would also limit our ability to raise capital through asset dispositions at attractive prices or at all 
inflation a majority of our leases provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and operating expenses either on a triple net basis or over a base amount 
in addition  many of our office leases provide for fixed base rent increases 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be partially offset by expense reimbursement and contractual rent increases 
there were also reductions in our rental rates on some of our new leases and renewals due to the current operating environment 
commitments and contingencies the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our contractual commitments as of december  payments by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years mortgage notes payable a revolving credit facility unsecured term loan unsecured debt a ground leases b interest expense development contracts c other liabilities a amounts do not include unamortized discounts and or premiums

c represents contractual obligations for certain development projects and does not contemplate all costs expected to be incurred 
as part of the trc acquisition  we acquired our interest in two logan square  a  square foot office building in philadelphia  primarily through our ownership of a second and third mortgage secured by this property 
this property is consolidated as the borrower is a variable interest entity and we  through our ownership of the second and third mortgages are the primary beneficiary 
we currently do not expect to take title to two logan square until  at the earliest  september if we take fee title to two logan square upon a foreclosure of our mortgage  we have agreed to pay an unaffiliated third party that holds a residual interest in the fee owner of this property an amount equal to million if we must pay a state and local transfer upon taking title and million if no transfer tax is payable upon the transfer 

table of contents we are currently being audited by the internal revenue service for our tax year 
the audit concerns the tax treatment of the transaction in september in which we acquired a portfolio of properties through the acquisition of a limited partnership 
at this time it does not appear that an adjustment would result in a material tax liability for us 
however  an adjustment could raise a question as to whether a contributor of partnership interests in the transaction could assert a claim against us under the tax protection agreement entered into as part of the transaction 
as part of our acquisition of prentiss properties trust  the trc acquisition in and several of our other transactions  we agreed not to sell certain of the properties we acquired in transactions that would trigger taxable income to the former owners 
in the case of the trc acquisition  we agreed not to sell acquired properties for periods up to years from the date of the trc acquisition date as follows at december  one rodney square and radnor financial center january  and one logan square  two logan square and radnor corporate center january 
in the prentiss acquisition  we assumed the obligation of prentiss not to sell concord airport plaza before march our agreements generally provide that we may dispose of the subject properties only in transactions that qualify as tax free exchanges under section of the internal revenue code or in other tax deferred transactions 
if we were to sell a restricted property before expiration of the restricted period in a non exempt transaction  we would be required to make significant payments to the parties who sold us the applicable property on account of tax liabilities triggered to them 
in connection with our development of the po box irs and cira garage projects  during  we entered into a historic tax credit and new markets tax credit arrangement  respectively 
we are required to be in compliance with various laws  regulations and contractual provisions that apply to our historic and new market tax credit arrangements 
non compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized and therefore  require a refund to usb or reduction of investor capital contributions  which are reported as deferred income in our consolidated balance sheet  until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved 
the remaining compliance periods for our tax credit arrangements run through we do not anticipate that any material refunds or reductions of investor capital contributions will be required in connection with these arrangements 
on june   we entered into a forward financing commitment to borrow up to million under two separate loans which are secured by mortgages on the th street post office the post office project  the cira south garage the garage project projects and by the leases of space at these facilities upon the completion of these projects see note 
in order for funding to occur we need to meet certain conditions which primarily relate to the completion of the projects and the commencement of the rental payments from the respective leases on these properties 
the expected funding date is scheduled on august  which is also the anticipated completion date of the projects 
in the event the said conditions were not met  we have the right to extend the funding date by paying an extension fee amounting to million for each day extension within the allowed two year extension period 
in addition  we can also voluntarily elect to terminate the loans during the forward period including the extension period by paying a termination fee 
we are also subject to the termination fee if the conditions were not met on the final advance date 
the termination fee is calculated as the greater of the of the total available principal to be funded or the present value of the scheduled interest and principal payments based on the principal amount to be funded and the then year treasury rate plus basis points from the funding date through the loans maturity date and the amount to be funded 
in addition  deferred financing costs related to these loans will be accelerated if we chose to terminate the forward financing commitment 
we invest in our properties and regularly incur capital expenditures in the ordinary course to maintain the properties 
we believe that such expenditures enhance our competitiveness 
we also enter into construction  utility and service contracts in the ordinary course of business which may extend beyond one year 
these contracts typically provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties 

table of contents interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates 
the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen 
our financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   our consolidated debt consisted of million in fixed rate mortgages  million borrowings under our credit facility  million borrowings in an unsecured  term loan and billion in unsecured notes net of discounts of which  million are fixed rate borrowings and million are variable rate borrowings 
all financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
as of december   based on prevailing interest rates and credit spreads  the fair value of our unsecured notes was billion 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of our debt  including the notes  of approximately million at december  we use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk exposures and not for speculative purposes 
as of december  we effectively hedged debt with a notional amount of million through four interest rate swap agreements 
these instruments have an aggregate fair value of million at december  in december  we settled in cash two of our interest swaps with a notional amount of million  which we have applied in the registered offering of our unsecured notes on september  the related interest swaps no longer qualify for hedge accounting upon the completion of the offering as the hedging relationship was terminated 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps were charged to our consolidated statements of operations until their cash settlement date 
we also recognized million gain from the ineffectiveness of the hedges during the twelve months ended december  the total carrying value of our variable rate debt was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the total fair value of our debt  excluding the notes  was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of our debt  excluding the notes  of approximately million at december   and a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of our debt of approximately million at december  if market rates of interest increase by  the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decrease by  the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt would increase by approximately million 
at december   our outstanding variable rate debt based on libor totaled approximately million 
at december   the interest rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 
if market interest rates on our variable rate debt change by basis points  total interest expense would change by approximately million for the quarter ended december  
table of contents these amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases  this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
