our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors

services revenues services revenues are derived from professional services that include developing  implementing  integrating  automating and extending business processes  technology infrastructure  and software applications 
most of our projects are performed on a time and materials basis  while a smaller portion of our revenues are derived from projects performed on a fixed fee basis 
fixed fee engagements represented approximately of our services revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  for time and material projects  revenues are recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours our professionals expend in the performance of the project by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenues are generally recognized using the input method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours 
amounts invoiced and collected in excess of revenues recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
on most projects  we are also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenues 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers  the total number of our projects that require travel  and whether our arrangements with our clients provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 
software and hardware revenues software and hardware revenues are derived from sales of third party software and hardware 
revenues from sales of third party software and hardware are generally recorded on a gross basis provided we act as a principal in the transaction 
on rare occasions  we do not meet the requirements to be considered a principal in the transaction and act as an agent 
in these cases  revenues are recorded on a net basis 
software and hardware revenues are expected to fluctuate depending on our customers demand for these products 
if we enter into contracts for the sale of services and software or hardware  management evaluates whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software or hardware and whether objective fair value evidence exists for each deliverable in the transaction 
if management concludes the services to be provided are not essential to the functionality of the software or hardware and can determine objective fair value evidence exists for each deliverable of the transaction  then we account for each deliverable in the transaction separately  based on the relevant revenue recognition policies 
generally  all deliverables of our multiple element arrangements meet these separation criteria 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of cash and non cash compensation and benefits  including bonuses and non cash compensation related to equity awards  associated with our technology professionals 
cost of revenues also includes the costs associated with subcontractors 
third party software and hardware costs  reimbursable expenses and other unreimbursed project related expenses are also included in cost of revenues 
project related expenses will fluctuate generally depending on outside factors including the cost and frequency of travel and the location of our customers 
cost of revenues does not include depreciation of assets used in the production of revenues which are primarily personal computers  servers and other information technology related equipment 
gross margins our gross margins for services are affected by the utilization rates of our professionals defined as the percentage of our professionals time billed to customers divided by the total available hours in the respective period  the salaries we pay our consulting professionals and the average billing rate we receive from our customers 
if a project ends earlier than scheduled  we retain professionals in advance of receiving project assignments  or if demand for our services declines  our utilization rate will decline and adversely affect our gross margins 
gross margin percentages of third party software and hardware sales are typically lower than gross margin percentages for services  and the mix of services and software and hardware for a particular period can significantly impact our total combined gross margin percentage for such period 
in addition  gross margin for software and hardware sales can fluctuate due to pricing and other competitive pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a are primarily composed of sales related costs  general and administrative salaries  office costs  stock compensation expense  bad debts  and other miscellaneous expenses 
we work to minimize selling costs by focusing on repeat business with existing customers and by accessing sales leads generated by our software vendors  most notably ibm  oracle and microsoft  whose products we use to design and implement solutions for our clients 
these relationships enable us to reduce our selling costs and sales cycle times and increase win rates through leveraging our partners marketing efforts and endorsements 
plans for growth and acquisitions our goal is to continue to build one of the leading independent information technology consulting firms in north america by expanding our relationships with existing and new clients and through the resumption of our disciplined acquisition strategy 
our future growth plan includes expanding our business with a primary focus on the united states  both organically and through acquisitions 
given the economic conditions during and  we suspended acquisition activity pending improved visibility into the health of the economy 
with the expected return to growth in  we plan to resume our disciplined acquisition strategy 
we also intend to further leverage our existing offshore capabilities to support our future growth and provide our clients flexible options for project delivery

total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  services revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue contraction during the year is due to the decreased demand for information technology services market wide and delays in information technology spending by customers  which we believe is related to the general economic slowdown

provision for income taxes 
we provide for federal  state and foreign income taxes at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses 
our effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the effective rate is due primarily to the magnified effect of certain state taxes  which are generally based on gross receipts instead of income  permanent items such as meals and entertainment  and non deductible executive compensation under section m of the internal revenue code the code  relative to a smaller income base

the additional margin amount is dependent on the amount of outstanding borrowings 
as of december   we had million of maximum borrowing capacity 
we will incur an annual commitment fee of on the unused portion of the line of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility and we expect to be in compliance during the next twelve months 
stock repurchase program in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of the company s common stock for a total repurchase program of million

additional repurchases will be at times and in amounts as the company deems appropriate and will be made through open market transactions in compliance with rule b of the exchange act  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
since the program s inception in  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock through december  for a total cost of approximately million 
lease obligations during the third quarter of  we vacated certain office space as part of ongoing cost reduction initiatives in response to our revenue contraction 
we subleased some of the vacated office space during the fourth quarter of the accounting for costs associated with the abandonment of office space was calculated using the guidance in asc subtopic sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
a liability of approximately million for lease abandonment costs was recorded in the third quarter of the lease abandonment costs were classified as selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  there were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business in lease obligations or other contractual obligations in as disclosed in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
shelf registration statement in july  we filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission sec to allow for offers and sales of our common stock from time to time 
approximately four million shares of common stock may be sold under this registration statement if we choose to do so 
we determined that we currently have no intent to use the shelf registration to complete an offering 
the shelf registration will expire in july contractual obligations we have incurred commitments to make future payments under contracts such as leases 
maturities under these contracts are set forth in the following table as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations total see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to our obligations for taxes 
conclusion if our capital is insufficient to fund our activities in either the short or long term  we may need to raise additional funds 
in the ordinary course of business  we may engage in discussions with various persons in connection with additional financing 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders percentage ownership will be diluted 
these equity securities may also have rights superior to our common stock 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to expand our services  respond to competition  pursue acquisition opportunities or continue our operations 
we believe that the currently available funds  access to capital from our credit facility and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and other capital needs for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  purchase accounting  accounting for stock based compensation  and income taxes 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenues are primarily derived from professional services provided on a time and materials basis 
for time and material contracts  revenues are recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours expended in the performance of the contract by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenues are generally recognized using the input method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours 
amounts invoiced and collected in excess of revenues recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
on many projects we are also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenues 
revenues from software and hardware sales are generally recorded on a gross basis based on our role as a principal in the transaction 
on rare occasions  we enter into a transaction where we are not the principal 
in these cases  revenue is recorded on a net basis 
unbilled revenues represent the project time and expenses that have been incurred  but not yet billed to the client  prior to the end of the fiscal period 
for time and materials projects  the client is invoiced for the amount of hours worked times the billing rates as stated in the contract 
for fixed fee arrangements  the client is invoiced according to the agreed upon schedule detailing amount and timing of payments in the contract 
clients are typically billed monthly for services provided during that month  but can be billed on a more or less frequent basis as determined by the contract 
if the time and expenses are worked incurred and approved at the end of a fiscal period and the invoice has not yet been sent to the client  the amount is recorded as unbilled revenue once we verify all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the customer arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  delivery and acceptance have occurred  and collectibility is deemed probable 
our policy for revenue recognition in instances where multiple deliverables are sold contemporaneously to the same counterparty is in accordance with asc subtopic american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  asc subtopic emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and asc section s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
specifically  if we enter into contracts for the sale of services and software or hardware  we evaluate whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software or hardware and whether there is objective fair value evidence for each deliverable in the transaction 
if we conclude the services to be provided are not essential to the functionality of the software or hardware and we can determine objective fair value evidence for each deliverable of the transaction  then we account for each deliverable in the transaction separately  based on the relevant revenue recognition policies 
generally  all deliverables of our multiple element arrangements meet these criteria 
we may provide multiple services under the terms of an arrangement and are required to assess whether one or more units of accounting are present 
service fees are typically accounted for as one unit of accounting as fair value evidence for individual tasks or milestones is not available 
we follow the guidelines discussed above in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenues recognized in any accounting period 
if estimates are revised  material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenues recognized for a given period 
revenues are presented net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities 
sales taxes are generally collected and subsequently remitted on all software and hardware sales and certain services transactions as appropriate 
allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of likely and probable losses 
each accounting period  accounts receivable is evaluated for risk associated with a client s inability to make contractual payments  historical experience and other currently available information 
billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue or bad debts as appropriate in the period the risk is identified 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of the client  evaluating the successful mitigation of service delivery disputes  and gauging current market conditions 
if the evaluation of service delivery issues or a client s ability to pay is incorrect  future reductions to revenue or bad debt expense may be incurred 
goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  or net liabilities assumed  in a business combination 
in accordance with asc topic  we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill as of october each year and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
as required by asc topic  the impairment test is accomplished using a two step approach 
the first step screens for impairment and  when impairment is indicated  a second step is employed to measure the impairment 
our annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of october  our fair value as of the annual testing date exceeded our book value and consequently  no impairment was indicated 
our fair value was determined by weighting the results of two valuation methods market capitalization based on the average price of our common stock  including a control premium  for a reasonable period of time prior to the evaluation date generally days and a discounted cash flow model 
the fair value calculated using our average common stock price including a control premium was weighted while the value calculated by the discounted cash flow model was weighted in our determination of our overall fair value 
while the use of our average common stock price  plus a control premium  may be considered the best evidence of fair value in asc topic  we believe the declines in our stock price over the past two years  and in the market overall  are not consistently aligned with our financial results or outlook 
the discounted cash flow approach allows us to calculate our fair value based on operating performance and meaningful financial metrics 
a key assumption used in the calculation of our fair value using our average common stock price was the consideration of a control premium 
we reviewed industry premium data and determined an appropriate control premium for the analysis based on the low end of any premium received in transactions over the past several years 
significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow model included projections of revenue growth  net income margins  discount rate  and terminal business value 
the forecasts of revenue growth and net income margins are based upon our long term view of the business and are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 
the discount rate utilized was estimated using the weighted average cost of capital for our industry 
the terminal business value was determined by applying a growth factor to the latest year for which a forecast exists 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  non compete arrangements and internally developed software  which are being amortized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives range from three to eight years 
amortization of customer relationships  non compete arrangements and internally developed software is considered an operating expense and is included in amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a lack of recoverability or revised useful life 
during the fourth quarter of  our stock price continued trading above its book value 
based on the continued upward trend of our stock price and positive business and market outlook for the information technology services industry  we did not experience a significant adverse change in our business climate and therefore do not believe a triggering event occurred that would require a detailed test of goodwill for impairment as of december  we will continue to monitor the trend of our stock price and other market indicators to determine whether there is a triggering event that may require us to perform an interim impairment test in the future and record impairment charges to earnings  which could adversely affect our financial results 
purchase accounting we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
such fair market value assessments require significant judgments and estimates that can change materially as additional information becomes available 
the purchase price is allocated to intangibles based on our estimate and an independent valuation 
we finalize the purchase price allocation within twelve months of the acquisition date as certain initial accounting estimates are resolved 
accounting for stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  certain assumptions used in the black scholes model  such as expected term  can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
restricted stock awards are valued at the price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
recent accounting pronouncements our recent accounting pronouncements are fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  except operating lease commitments as disclosed in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
exchange rate sensitivity we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates because we generate a portion of our revenues and incur a portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of december   we were exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  between the us dollar and the chinese yuan  and between the us dollar and the indian rupee 
we have not hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is not significant 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the cash equivalents consist of money market funds and the investments consist of corporate bonds  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  us treasury bills and us agency bonds  which are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed interest rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the market value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income
