overview of the company the company is a provider of high technology  digital based printing solutions to the commercial print segment of the graphics communications industry 
the company designs  manufactures and distributes proprietary and non proprietary solutions aimed at serving the needs of a wide range of print service providers worldwide 
our proprietary digital imaging and advanced technology consumables offer superior business solutions for commercial printing focusing on the growing need for short run  high quality color applications 
we have helped to lead the industry s transformation from analog print production methods to digital imaging technology 
we are a leader in the development of advanced printing systems using digital imaging equipment  workflow and consumables based solutions that economically benefit the user through streamlined operations and chemistry free  environmentally responsible solutions 
we are also a leading sales and service channel across a broadly served market in the small to mid sized commercial  quick and in plant printing segments 
presstek s business model is a capital equipment and consumables model 
in this model  approximately two thirds of our revenue is recurring revenue 
our model is designed so that each placement of either a di press or a ctp system generally results in recurring aftermarket revenue for consumables and service 
we also provide consumables for use on equipment purchased by end users from other manufacturers and suppliers 
through our various operations  we provide advanced digital print solutions through the development  manufacture  and sourcing of digital laser imaging equipment and advanced technology chemistry free and chemistry based printing plates  which we call consumables  for commercial and in plant print providers targeting the growing market for high quality  fast turnaround short run color printing  are a leading sales and services company delivering presstek digital solutions and solutions from other manufacturing partners through our direct sales and service force and through distribution partners worldwide  through our lasertel subsidiary  we manufacture semiconductor solid state laser diodes for presstek imaging applications and for use in external applications as previously discussed the company sold lasertel to selex on march   and manufacture and distribute printing plates for conventional print applications 
we have developed the enabling technology for di digital offset presses 
di presses are presstek s proprietary system by which digital images are transferred directly onto printing plates that are already mounted on press 
our advanced di presses are a waterless  easy to use  high quality printing press that is fully automated and provides our users with competitive advantages over alternative print technologies 
we believe that our di digital offset presses  in combination with our proprietary printing plates and streamlined workflow  produces a superior offset printing solution 
by combining advanced digital technology with the reliability and economic advantages of offset printing  we believe our customers are better able to grow their businesses  generate higher profits and better serve the needs of their customers 
similar digital imaging technologies are used in our ctp systems 
our presstek segment also designs and manufactures ctp systems that incorporate our technology to image our chemistry free printing plates 
our chemistry free digital imaging systems enable customers to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials more quickly and cost effectively than conventional methods that employ more complicated workflows and toxic chemical processing 
this results in reduced printing cycle time and lowers the effective cost of production for commercial printers 
our solutions make it more cost effective for printers to meet the increasing demand for shorter print runs  higher quality color and faster turn around times 
we have executed a major transformation in the way we go to market 
in the past  we had been reliant on oem partners to deliver our business solutions to customers 
today  more than of our sales are through our own distribution channels 
in addition to marketing  selling and servicing our proprietary digital products  we also market  sell and service traditional or analog products for the commercial print market 
this analog equipment is manufactured by third party strategic partners and the analog consumables are manufactured by either us or our strategic partners 
the addition of these non proprietary products and our ability to directly sell and service them was made possible by the ab dick acquisition and precision acquisition  which we completed in we currently have two reporting segments i presstek and ii lasertel 
on september   the board of directors approved a plan to market the lasertel subsidiary for sale  as such the company has presented the results of operations of this subsidiary within discontinued operations 
on march   the lasertel subsidiary was sold to selex as previously discussed 
commencing with the second quarter of the fiscal  the company s reports filed with the sec will reflect that the company conducts business in one industry segment as a result of its sale of lasertel on march  a description of the types of products and services provided by each business segment follows 
presstek is primarily engaged in the development  manufacture  sourcing  sale and servicing of our business solutions using patented digital imaging systems and patented printing plate technologies 
we also provide traditional analog systems and related equipment and supplies for the graphic arts and printing industries 
lasertel manufactures and develops high powered laser diodes and related laser products 
we generate revenue through three main sources i the sale of our equipment and related workflow software  including di presses and ctp devices  ii the sale of our proprietary and non proprietary consumables and supplies  and iii the servicing of offset printing systems and analog and ctp systems and related equipment 
strategy our business strategy is centered on maximizing the sale of consumable products  such as printing plates  and therefore our business efforts focus on the sale of consumable burning engines such as our di presses and ctp devices  as well as the servicing of customers using our business solutions 
our strategy centers on increasing the number of our di and ctp units  which increases the demand for our consumables 
to complement our direct sales efforts  in certain territories  we maintain relationships with key press manufacturers such as ryobi  heidelberg  and kba  who market printing presses and or press solutions that use our proprietary consumables 
another method of growing the market for consumables is to develop and distribute consumables that can be imaged by non presstek devices 
in addition to expanding the base of our di and ctp units  an element of our focus is to reach beyond our proprietary systems and penetrate the installed base of ctp devices in all market segments with our thermal plate offerings 
the first step in executing this strategy was the launch of our aurora pro chemistry free printing plate designed to be used with ctp units manufactured by other thermal ctp device manufacturers 
in december  we introduced aeon  a no preheat thermal ctp plate that offers run lengths to  without baking 
we continue to work with other ctp manufacturers to qualify our consumables on their systems 
we believe this shift in strategy fundamentally enhances our ability to expand and control our business 
since  management has been taking steps to improve the company s cost structure and strengthen its balance sheet in order to enable presstek to improve profitability and strengthen its overall financial position 
our reduced cost levels and balance sheet improvements to date are  in large part  the result of our cost reduction initiatives as described in more detail below  as well as a continuing focused effort to review and manage working capital 
highlights in fiscal  deteriorating worldwide economic conditions caused significant volatility in many markets which adversely impacted our business 
overall commercial print industry volume was reduced as companies cut back on general advertising and promotional materials  and uncertainty regarding the economy and tightening credit markets led to delays in capital purchase decisions 
as a result of this volatility  as well as continuing erosion due to technological changes impacting our traditional product business  revenues in fiscal of million were down million  or  compared to the prior year 
management objectives our vision is to provide high quality  fully integrated digital solutions and services that enable us to form an all encompassing relationship with our customers 
our business strategy is to offer innovative digital imaging and plate technologies that address the opportunities of today and tomorrow in the graphic arts and commercial printing markets across the globe 
this strategy includes several imperatives focus on the growth of our consumables product line  emphasize attractive market segments such as larger print providers  focus on growing existing segments such as print shops with less than employees  enable customers to better compete by offering a more diverse range of products  continue to expand solutions that meet the growth in demand for short run  fast turnaround high quality color printing  and provide environmentally responsible solutions through our application of technology 
cost reduction initiatives during august the company initiated cost reductions to generate approximately million of annualized savings 
presstek incurred one time costs of approximately million related to these actions 
as part of these initiatives  the company reduced its global workforce across all levels of the organization by approximately positions  or fourteen percent 
additional cost actions resulted in the elimination of the k company matching contribution and furloughs in certain of the company s operating areas 
these programs have been essentially completed as of the end of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced our business improvement plan bip 
the plan involved virtually every aspect of the business and included pricing actions  improved manufacturing efficiencies  increased utilization of field service resources  right sizing of operating expenses  and cash flow improvements driven by working capital reductions and the sale of selected real estate assets 
the company has made significant improvements to its cost structure as a result of these cost reduction initiatives 
since the second quarter of  headcount has been reduced by  leased facilities have been consolidated  operating expenses  excluding special charges  have been reduced from million in the second quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decline of  working capital has decreased from million at june  to million at january   total debt decreased to million  and the company completed the sale of its real estate located in tucson  az for million in fiscal and the sale of its lasertel subsidiary for million in cash  certain net working capital adjustments and  in addition  presstek was able to retain approximately million of laser diode inventory 
internal review beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we commenced a self initiated internal review of certain practices and procedures surrounding inventory  accounts receivable and commercial receivable terms 
we conducted a worldwide review of accounts receivable  conducted a worldwide physical inventory to assess the existence and valuation of inventory  and reviewed revenue practices surrounding the commercial terms granted in certain transactions  resulting in an enhanced revenue recognition policy 
the culmination of these actions resulted in increased professional fees during the latter part of fiscal and a negative impact to revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal largely due to the disruption in our european operations related to the business reviews  as well as tightened commercial receivable terms

sales of presstek s growth portfolio of consumables  defined as di  di  and chemistry free ctp plates  declined from million in to million in the current year  reflecting underutilized capacity in the printing markets resulting from the slow economy as well as customer inventory reductions 
overall sales of presstek s growth portfolio of di plates declined from million in to million in sales of chemistry free ctp plates declined by in from million in service and parts revenues were million in reflecting a decrease of million  or  from the prior year 
the decrease is due primarily to lower parts revenues resulting from the transition of our customer base from analog to digital solutions as well as lower equipment usage and installations due to the sluggish economy 
cost of revenue consolidated cost of product  consisting of costs of material  labor and overhead  shipping and handling costs and warranty expenses  was million in compared to million in the prior year 
the overall decrease in product cost was due primarily to lower revenues  offset partially by the negative impacts of foreign exchange  reduced productivity in equipment and digital plate manufacturing caused by lower production levels and a inventory adjustment 
cost of product in includes a charge of million related to lower production volume levels in our equipment manufacturing plant and the impact of a change in certain product strategies 
consolidated cost of service and parts declined from million in to million in these amounts represent the cost of spare parts  labor and overhead associated with the ongoing service of products 
the reduction in overall cost is due primarily to lower field service expenses resulting from cost reduction initiatives  as well as lower revenues 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of product revenues was in compared to in gross profit has been negatively impacted in by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the negative impact of reduced manufacturing productivity due to the volume reductions from the deterioration of the global economy

goodwill based on events including the decline in the company s stock price during the second quarter of and the unstable economic and credit conditions impacting the company s business  the company identified a triggering event that caused management to test goodwill for impairment as of july  after completing step one of the impairment test  the company determined that the estimated fair value of its reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  requiring the completion of the second step of the impairment test 
to measure the amount of impairment  topic prescribes that the company determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the company had acquired the reporting unit 
specifically  the company must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit  including unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two 
upon completion of step two of the analysis  the company wrote off the entire goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment loss of million in the quarter ended july  the company had no goodwill balance remaining as of january  the goodwill impairment charge is non cash in nature and does not affect the company s liquidity  cash flows from operating activities or debt covenants and will not have a material impact on future operations 
interest and other income expense  net consolidated interest and other income expense  net  was an expense of million in compared to income of million in the increase in expense is comprised primarily of an unfavorable swing in foreign currency impacts of million  million related to the estimated sec penalty see note and million related to forbearance fees see note  offset partially by million of proceeds from favorable resolution of an insurance contract lawsuit settlement 
provision benefit for income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the variance from the federal statutory rate for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets in the united states

 accounting for income taxes  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million against fiscal net us deferred tax assets 
the company recorded a fiscal valuation allowance of million against net us deferred tax assets  mainly attributable to current year net operating losses  for which no fiscal tax benefit was recorded 
however  if future events differ from expectations  an increase or decrease of the valuation allowance may be required 
a change in the valuation occurs if there is a change in management s assessment of the amount of net tax deferred assets that is expected to be realized in the future 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from million in fiscal  due in large part to deterioration in the global economy  as well as the continuing decline in our traditional lines of business 
specifically  sales of presstek s growth portfolio of products  defined as di and di digital offset solutions and the presstek family of chemistry free ctp solutions  decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the global economic issues have heavily impacted the sale of capital equipment  particularly to smaller size printers 
it has also resulted in lower volumes of printed materials  and thus impacted consumable and service revenues 
sales of presstek branded di plates increased by million  or  during  as the number of di installations continues to grow 
equipment revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  resulting primarily from the impact of the global economic downturn 
in addition  european sales were negatively impacted in the first quarter of fiscal due to a disruption in operations related to the company s business reviews conducted in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from the sale of di equipment in fiscal of million reflect a decrease of million  or  compared to unit sales of di presses declined from in fiscal to in fiscal sales of our remaining growth portfolio of equipment  presstek s ctp platesetters and vector machines  declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal equipment sales of our traditional line of products  defined as qmdi presses  polyester ctp platesetters  and conventional equipment  were all lower in fiscal compared to due primarily to the ongoing transition of our customer base to more modern digital technologies 
as a percentage of total equipment revenue  net sales of growth portfolio products increased from of revenue in fiscal to of revenue in fiscal consumable product revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a reduction of million  or 
the decrease in revenues resulted primarily from the anticipated decline in presstek s traditional portfolio of product  defined as qmdi plates  other di plates  polyester plates  and conventional consumables  and was consistent with industry trends 
sales of traditional plates declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
sales of conventional consumables declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal presstek s growth portfolio of consumables  defined as di  di  and chemistry free ctp plates  declined slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to lower print volumes related to the economic slowdown 
sales of di plates  however  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal service and parts revenues declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
lower revenues resulted primarily from the anticipated shift away from our less profitable legacy service base which  in the short term  is declining faster than our digital service business is accelerating 
in addition  lower print volume  as mentioned above  also had a negative impact on service revenue 
cost of revenue consolidated cost of revenue was million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to fiscal cost of product  consisting of costs of material  labor and overhead  shipping and handling costs and warranty expenses  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded million of charges consisting primarily of million for the write off of excess and obsolete inventory  million of inventory write downs related to the vector tx  million of warranty related expenses  and million of other adjustments 
lower cost of sales was primarily due to reduced sales volume  benefits resulting from our bip including manufacturing productivity improvements  procurement savings  and rationalization of our service business  the impact of favorable product mix and lower freight costs 
cost of service in fiscal  was million  including a million write down of field service parts inventory  compared to million in fiscal these amounts represent the costs of spare parts  labor and overhead associated with the ongoing service of products 
service costs in fiscal were favorably impacted by the improved utilization of the field service organization in north america  as well as improved controls over the field service parts inventory 
these actions were the result of our bip which included a realignment of our service organization in reaction to a declining analog revenue base 
gross profit consolidated gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the year over year improvement is driven by several factors  including favorable product mix  benefits from the bip  the improvement of numerous operating disciplines which negatively impacted our results ex 
excess and obsolete inventory  field service parts inventory charges and the absence in fiscal of significant warranty charges recorded during related to product portfolio changes 
gross profit as a percentage of product revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this improvement reflects the benefits described in the previous paragraph 
margins were also favorably impacted by a higher mix of di revenues  which are predominately higher margin products than our ctp and traditional lines of business  as well as improved production efficiencies in our plate manufacturing 
gross profit as a percentage of service revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal service margins in were negatively impacted by charges for losses on field service parts inventory of million 
higher service margins in fiscal also reflect the impact of cost savings resulting from our bip 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel  parts and supplies  and contracted services required to conduct our equipment  consumables and laser diode development efforts 
research and development expenses of million in fiscal were essentially unchanged from million in the prior year period

in addition  included a one time million restricted stock grant to our ceo and million of audit and accounting costs related to an extensive worldwide review of inventory and receivables  as well as certain european business processes and revenue recognition practices 
this was partially offset by additional bad debt expense incurred in fiscal resulting from the impact of worsening global economic conditions 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense of million in fiscal declined from million in the comparable prior year period 
these expenses relate to intangible assets recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of assets of the ab dick company  patents and other purchased intangible assets 
the year over year decline in amortization resulted primarily from the ab dick name and ab dick patents  which became fully amortized during the third quarter of fiscal restructuring and other charges consolidated restructuring and other charges of million in fiscal decreased from million in fiscal expenses incurred in fiscal include restructuring costs related to the implementation of our bip  severance and separation expenses of employment contracts of former executives and other employees  and costs related to the transfer of certain corporate functions from the hudson  new hampshire facility to the greenwich  connecticut facility

 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
accordingly  results of operations and the related charges for discontinued operations have been classified as loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been reclassified and reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as assets of discontinued operations and liabilities of discontinued operations 
for comparative purposes  all prior periods presented have been reclassified on a consistent basis 
lasertel on september   the board of directors approved a plan to sell the lasertel subsidiary as the lasertel business is not a core focus for the presstek graphics business 
on march   presstek sold lasertel to selex as previously discussed 
as a subsidiary of selex  and in accordance with a supply agreement established between lasertel and presstek on march   lasertel will manufacture and supply semiconductor laser diodes to presstek for an initial period of three years 
the company has presented the results of operations of this subsidiary within discontinued operations  classified the assets as assets of discontinued operations and liabilities as liabilities of discontinued operations 
lasertel incurred a loss of million during fiscal  as compared to a loss of million during the loss includes a non cash impairment charge of million  and million of legal fees related to the negotiation and signing of a definitive agreement to sell the business 
the major increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal is increased sales to certain key customers in europe and a rebound in sales to the chinese market

liquidity and capital resources we finance our operating and capital investment requirements primarily through cash flows from operations and borrowings 
at january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital  compared to million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital at january  continuing operations our operating activities provided million of cash generation in fiscal cash generated during the year from lower inventory of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million was essentially offset by a net loss from continuing operations of million after adjustments for non cash write off of goodwill  valuation allowance of the deferred income taxes  depreciation  amortization  provisions for warranty costs and accounts receivable allowances  stock compensation expense  and loss on disposal of assets 
cash flows were further negatively impacted by a decrease of million in deferred revenue  a decrease of million in accounts payable  and a decrease of million in accrued expenses 
the changes in accrued expenses and accounts payable were due mainly to the timing of transactions and related payments 
the decreases in inventory and accounts receivable levels were due primarily to declining sales and a continuing focused effort to manage working capital 
we used million of net cash for investing activities during fiscal primarily comprised of additions to property  plant and equipment and capitalized technology development expenditures 
our additions to property  plant and equipment relate primarily to production equipment and investments in our infrastructure 
our financing activities provided million of cash  comprised primarily of million of net borrowings offset by million of cash repayments on our term loan 
the term loan was fully repaid as of january  discontinued operations operating activities of discontinued operations used million in cash in fiscal cash used in operating activities came from a net loss  after adjustments for an asset impairment charge of million and other non cash addbacks in addition to working capital usages which were mainly inventory related 
investing activities of discontinued operations is made up of million of cash used for additions of fixed assets 
sale leaseback on july   the company completed a sale leaseback transaction of its property located in tucson  arizona the property 
the company sold the property to an independent third party for approximately million  or million net of expenses incurred in connection with the sale  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
concurrent with the sale  the company entered in to an agreement to lease a portion of the property back from the purchaser for a term of years 
the lease  which management deemed to be an operating lease  has approximately million in future minimum lease payments 
the gain associated with the transaction was deferred at the inception of the arrangement and is being amortized ratably over the lease term 
subsequent to  and independent of  the sale and leaseback of the property  the board of directors of the company approved an action for the sale of the lasertel business as addressed in note as such  the operations of lasertel have been presented as discontinued operations 
included within the liabilities of discontinued operations is the aforementioned deferred gain associated with the arizona property in which lasertel conducts its operations 
the related amortization of the gain is included in income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
as part of the sale of lasertel to selex on march   the buyer assumed all of the company s obligations under the lease 
liquidity the primary sources of the company s liquidity are i cash generated by the company s operations and ii a million revolving credit and security agreement with a term that expires on march  the revolver 
the company entered into the revolver on march  and repaid the line of credit which was in existence at january  the company utilizes its sources of liquidity to fund current operations and make capital and other investments in support of the business 
while the company has historically generated positive cash from operations  as a result of the downturn in the world economy primarily during and  the company has experienced difficulty during the second and third fiscal quarters of in generating positive cash flows and was reliant upon its ability to access its then current credit facility to cover the negative gap in its cash needs 
the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants of its then existing line of credit agreement and on october  entered into a forbearance agreement with its lenders 
see note for further discussion 
this trend reversed itself in the fourth fiscal quarter of when the company generated positive adjusted ebitda of million and reduced its debt net of cash by million primarily as a result of positive cash flow from operations 
in addition to the bip implemented in and  management implemented additional cost reduction initiatives in that have significantly reduced the company s operating costs 
these actions are intended to facilitate further profitability and the generation of positive cash flows on a recurring quarterly basis once the global economy reflects significant signs of improvement and the company s revenues increase 
because much of the company s revenue generation is dependent upon decisions by its customers to make significant capital equipment purchases which have been stifled by current economic conditions  the company is unable to predict when or if the company s revenues will grow substantially in order to support the generation of positive cash flows from operations and increased liquidity on a regular recurring basis 
under the terms of the revolver  the company is able to borrow  repay and re borrow an amount  not to exceed million  that is based upon a percentage of the company s eligible trade accounts receivables and inventory inventory has a sub limit of million  as defined in the revolver the formula amount 
based upon the formula amount  less a required availability reduction of million  the company s available credit as of march   was million 
as of january   the company s outstanding indebtedness under its then current credit facility was million and its available cash on hand as of january  was million  resulting in a debt net of cash balance of million 
on march   the company sold its lasertel subsidiary for million in cash  certain net working capital adjustments and  in addition  presstek was able to retain approximately million of laser diode inventory  and used the net cash proceeds of this transaction to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
accordingly  the company believes that the company s available credit under the revolver provides sufficient liquidity to support the company s current needs through at least the next months 
however  if the company is unable to generate positive cash flow from operations  and if it becomes reliant upon available credit capacity under the revolver to fill a negative cash flow gap  then the amount of available credit under the revolver may be insufficient to support the company s liquidity needs 
additionally  under the terms of the revolver  beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of the company is required to meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirement of not less than to the company s inability to satisfy this requirement may result in a default under the revolver and the elimination of available liquidity 
during the past two years  the company has generated liquidity through the sale of a non strategic asset and business 
in the company sold its property located in tucson  arizona that was used by the company s former lasertel subsidiary  for million 
the company used the net proceeds of this sale to reduce debt 
on march   the company sold lasertel for million in cash  certain net working capital adjustments and  in addition  presstek was able to retain approximately million of laser diode inventory  and it used the net cash proceeds to reduce debt 
the company has other assets that it could seek to monetize in order to generate liquidity  most notably its office and manufacturing facility in hudson  new hampshire that the company has recently as of the second quarter of fiscal marketed for a potential sale leaseback transaction 
the weighted average interest rate on the company s short term borrowings was at january  we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations  and cash available from the revolver and other sources as discussed above will be sufficient to satisfy cash requirements through at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to generate positive cash flows  achieve financial performance sufficient to maintain compliance with the terms of the revolver or be able to generate liquidity through the sale of additional assets 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations at january  consisted of the following in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years five or more years senior secured credit facilities purchase commitments royalty obligation operating leases total contractual obligations in fiscal  we entered into an agreement with fuji  whereby minimum royalty payments to fuji are required based on specified sales volumes of our a format size four color sheet fed di presses 
the agreement provides for total royalty payments to be no less than million and not greater than million over the life of the agreement 
as of january   the company had paid fuji million related to this agreement 
from time to time we have engaged in sales of equipment that is leased by or intended to be leased by a third party purchaser to another party 
in certain situations  we may retain recourse obligations to a financing institution involved in providing financing to the ultimate lessee in the event the lessee of the equipment defaults on its lease obligations 
in certain such instances  we may refurbish and remarket the equipment on behalf of the financing company  should the ultimate lessee default on payment of the lease 
in certain circumstances  should the resale price of such equipment fall below certain predetermined levels  we would  under these arrangements  reimburse the financing company for any such shortfall in sale price a shortfall payment 
the maximum contingent obligation under these shortfall payment arrangements is estimated to be million at january  of which million relating to full recourse arrangements is reflected in deferred revenue on the company s balance sheet at january our discontinued lasertel segment utilized facilities in arizona 
this operating lease  included above  was transferred to lasertel in connection with the march  sale of the lasertel subsidiary 
effect of inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our financial conditions or results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards at january   we had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes totaling million  of which million resulted from stock option compensation deductions for us federal tax purposes and million resulted from operating losses 
to the extent that net operating losses resulting from stock option compensation deductions result in reduction of current taxes payable  the benefit will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the future if the company experiences an ownership change  as defined by the internal revenue code 
an ownership change involves an increase of more than percentage points in stock ownership by one or more shareholders over a three year period 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of reported revenue and expenses during the period 
management believes the most judgmental estimates include those related to product returns  warranty obligations  allowances for doubtful accounts  slow moving and obsolete inventories  income taxes  the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and deferred tax assets  stock based compensation and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other appropriate factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue principally from the sale of products equipment  consumables  laser diodes and services equipment maintenance contracts  installation  training  support  and spare parts 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition sab and fasb accounting standards codification topic multiple element arrangements originally issued as emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as equipment and services  revenue is allocated to each element using the residual method 
product revenue end users under the company s standard terms and conditions of sale of equipment  title and risk of loss are transferred to end user customers upon completion of installation and revenue is recognized at that time  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant deliverables remain 
sales of other products  including printing plates  are generally recognized at the time of shipment 
oems product revenue and any related royalties for products sold to original equipment manufacturers oem are recognized at the time of shipment as installation is not required and title and risk of loss generally pass at shipment 
oem contracts do not generally include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
distributors revenue for product sold to distributors  whereby the distributor is responsible for installation  is recognized at shipment  unless other revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
revenue for product sold to distributors under contracts which involve company installation of equipment is recognized upon installation  unless end user customer acceptance is uncertain  significant deliverables remain  or other revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
except in cases of contract termination which may include limited product return rights  distributor contracts do not generally include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
service and parts revenue revenue for installation services  including time and material billings  are recognized as services are rendered 
revenue associated with maintenance or extended service agreements is recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenue associated with training and support services is recognized as services are rendered 
certain fees and other reimbursements are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed or the revenue is otherwise earned 
leases the company may offer customer financing to assist customers in the acquisition of presstek products 
at the time a financing transaction is consummated  which qualifies as a sales type lease  the company records equipment revenue equal to the net present value of future lease payments 
any remaining balance is recognized as finance income using the effective interest method over the term of the lease 
leases not qualifying as sales type leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the company recognizes revenue from operating leases on an accrual basis as the rental payments become due 
multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab and topic  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as equipment  consumables or services  revenue is allocated to each element using the residual method 
rights of return a general right of return or cancellation does not exist once product is delivered to the customer  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
product revenues are recorded net of estimated returns  which are adjusted periodically  based upon historical rates of return 
shipping and handling the company accounts for shipping and handling fees passed on to customers as revenue 
shipping and handling costs are reported as components of cost of revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms  carried at face value less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis and adjusts for potential credit losses when it determines that receivables are at risk for collection based upon the length of time receivables are outstanding  past transaction history and various other criteria 
receivables are written off against reserves in the period they are determined to be uncollectible 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we assess the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated market value based upon forecasted demand for its products 
if actual demand is less favorable than what has been forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets in order to complete the two step goodwill impairment tests as required by fasb accounting standards codification topic intangibles goodwill and other originally issued as sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
in accordance with the provisions of topic  the company designates reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill impairment 
topic defines a reporting unit as the lowest level of an entity that is a business and that can be distinguished  physically and operationally and for internal reporting purposes  from the other activities  operations  and assets of the entity 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units of the company that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
based on the provisions of topic  the company has determined that it has one reporting unit in continuing operations for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the company s impairment review is based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of the company s reporting units based on a discounted cash flow approach  and the market approach which estimates the fair value of the company s reporting unit based on comparable market multiples 
the average fair value is then reconciled to the company s market capitalization with an appropriate control premium 
the discount rate utilized in the discounted cash flows analysis in the quarter ended july  the last time this analysis was performed was approximately  reflecting market based estimates of capital costs and discount rates adjusted for a market participant s view with respect to execution  concentration  and other risks associated with the projected cash flows of the individual reporting units 
the peer companies used in the market approach are primarily the major competitors 
the company s valuation methodology requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance 
the company s policy is to perform its annual goodwill impairment test on the first business day of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
based on events including the decline in the company s stock price during the second quarter of and the unstable economic and credit conditions impacting the company s business  the company identified a triggering event that caused management to test goodwill for impairment as of july  after completing step one of the impairment test  the company determined that the estimated fair value of its reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  requiring the completion of the second step of the impairment test 
to measure the amount of impairment  topic prescribes that the company determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the company had acquired the reporting unit 
specifically  the company must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit  including unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two 
upon completion of step two of the analysis  the company wrote off the entire goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment loss of million in the quarter ended july  the company had no goodwill balance remaining as of january  the goodwill impairment charge is non cash in nature and does not affect the company s liquidity  cash flows from operating activities or debt covenants and will not have a material impact on future operations 
based on our market capitalization relative to the company s net assets any possible changes in the assumptions in the goodwill impairment test would not change our conclusion 
intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  property plant and equipment originally issued as sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable  the company will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on either discounted future pretax operating cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
the company determines the discount rate for this analysis based on the expected internal rate of return of the related business and does not allocate interest charges to the asset or asset group being measured 
considerable judgment is required to estimate discounted future operating cash flows 
patents represent the cost of preparing and filing applications to patent the company s proprietary technologies  in addition to certain patent and license rights obtained in the company s acquisitions or other related transactions 
such costs are amortized over a period ranging from five to seven years  beginning on the date the patents or rights are issued or acquired 
from time to time  the company enters into agreements with third parties under which the party will design and prototype a product incorporating presstek products and technology 
the capitalized costs associated with rights or intellectual property under these agreements will be amortized over the estimated sales life cycle and future cash flows of the product 
the company does not amortize capitalized costs related to either patents or purchased intellectual property until the respective asset has been placed into service 
the company amortizes license agreements and loan origination fees over the term of the respective agreement 
the amortizable lives of the company s other intangible assets are as follows trade names years customer relationships years software licenses years non compete covenants years stock based compensation the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb accounting standards codification topic  stock compensation  originally adopted by the company in january   as sfas r share based payment  as amended sfas r  using the modified prospective method  we recognize the fair value of stock compensation in our consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period  generally on a straight line basis for time vested awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of topic  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period 
further  we have elected under topic to recognize the fair value of awards with pro rata vesting on a straight line basis 
previously  we had followed accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which resulted in the accounting for employee share options at their intrinsic value in the consolidated financial statements 
under topic  our stock based compensation is affected by our stock price as well as valuation assumptions  including the volatility of our stock price  expected term of the option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value on the date of grant of employee stock options 
we estimate volatility primarily using the historical volatility of presstek common stock over the expected term 
any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of the stock based award 
accounting for income taxes the process of accounting for income taxes involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we would not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we would establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we would adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  including estimates associated with uncertain tax positions and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
we have accumulated us federal and state income tax nol carryforwards  research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we established a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet primarily representing nols from our us operations 
we continually assess our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may require the establishment or reduction of a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments 
in fiscal  the company established a full valuation allowance against its us and state net deferred tax assets 
based upon a review of historical operating performance through  and our expectation that we will generate profits in our international operations in the foreseeable future  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the international deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  will be fully realized

off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose 
as of january   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities  commodity price risk  and to a lesser extent  our investing activities and foreign currency fluctuations 
our borrowings are in variable rate instruments  with interest rates tied to either the prime rate or the libor 
a basis point change in these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense  assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held at the end of fiscal commodity price movements create a market risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials 
the company purchases aluminum for use in manufacturing consumables products and is embedded in certain components we purchase from major suppliers 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with certain suppliers to manage price risks within a specified range of prices  however  our suppliers generally pass on significant commodity price changes to us in the form of revised prices on future purchases 
the company has not used commodity forward or option contracts to manage this market risk 
the company operates foreign subsidiaries in canada  europe and asia and is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
presstek routinely evaluates whether the foreign exchange risk associated with its foreign currency exposures acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency 
the company has not hedged the net assets or net income of its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  certain key customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states 
as a result  these parties may be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the us dollar  their ability to purchase and market our products could be adversely affected and our products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on our business 
likewise  certain major suppliers are not located in the united states and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with us 
decreases in the value of their home country currency  versus that of the us dollar  could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on our business
