this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results and business plans discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in item a 
risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
our business activities we are engaged  through our subsidiaries and ventures in which we are a participant  in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
we initiated these activities in we and our joint participants have been granted exploration rights pursuant to pscs we have entered into with the government of india 
at present  these activities are being undertaken in four geological basins offshore and onshore in locations where reserves of oil or natural gas are believed by our management to exist 
these areas are as follows the krishna godavari basin offshore and onshore in the state of andhra pradesh in south eastern india  the cambay basin onshore in the state of gujarat in western india  the deccan syneclise basin onshore in the state of maharashtra in west central india  and the rajasthan basin onshore in the state of rajasthan in north western india 

table of contents may saw the commencement of oil revenue from our tarapur exploration block in the cambay basin 
to date however  we have not achieved our planned principal operations and are considered to be in the development stage 
the recoverability of the exploration costs we have incurred to date is uncertain and dependent upon us achieving significant commercial production  our ability to obtain sufficient financing to fulfill our obligations under the pscs in india and upon future profitable operations 
all of the exploration activities in which we are a participant should be considered highly speculative 
results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss is a result of realizing an asset impairment in of million compared with no asset impairment in the year this decrease is offset by an increase in our general and administrative expenses and consulting fees combined with a decline in our interest income 
oil and gas operations year ended december  year ended december  oil production barrels oil sales barrels oil sales average oil price per barrel operating costs operating costs per barrel depletion depletion per barrel oil sales all of our oil sales are derived from the production of crude oil in india 
with the approval of the tarapur field development plan by the management committee  three wells began production in mid may and a further two wells began production in september there are twelve additional wells which are drilled  tested and awaiting tie in to the oil tank storage facilities 
oil sales for the year ended december  were million or per barrel 
oil sales are currently based on the spot price based on the nigeria bonny light crude bench mark 
to date  none of our production has been hedged 
in addition to the crude oil production  a minimal amount of associated natural gas was produced and flared off 
commencing with the first quarter in  the associated natural gas has been contained and sold 
we did not incur any oil sales during the year ended december interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in this decrease is directly related to the decrease in us prime interest rate in as compared to as well a decrease in the amount of our invested cash balances 
operating costs operating costs for the year ended december  were million or per barrel  as a result of our first production in the tarapur field which commenced in may the operating costs include handling and processing charges  transportation costs  utilities  maintenance and tank rental charges and contain a fixed and variable portion 
we did not incur any operating costs during the year ended december  general and administrative our general and administrative expenses increased to million from million 
these general and administrative expenses include costs related to the corporate head office including administrative salaries and services  directors fees  rent and office costs  insurance  bank guarantee fees  nyse amex listing and filing fees  investor relation services and transfer agent fees and services 
also included in our general and administrative expenses are our compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements with employees and directors which are being expensed over their respective vesting periods of the related option grants 
these stock based compensation costs increased to million from million for the same period in the remaining majority of the increase in the general and administrative expenses is a result of an increase in directors fees of million and interest  penalties and related costs of million in regularizing our respective tax and regulatory filings in our various countries of operations 

table of contents consulting fees our consulting fees increased to million during the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
this change is mostly attributable to the increase for stock based compensation with non employee consultants for the year ended december  being million versus a reversal of million for the year ended december  a portion of this increase is also a result of the accounting for the consulting fees paid under our technical services agreement with a corporation wholly owned by mr 
roy  whereby we expensed million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  the balance of the increase is a result of other fees and expenses we incurred in employing various technical and corporate consultants who advised us on a variety of matters 
professional fees professional fees decreased slightly to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  professional fees include those paid to our auditors for pre approved audit  accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements 
depletion and depreciation depletion and depreciation increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  as a result of our first production in the tarapur field we had depletion of million or per barrel for the year ended december   and depreciation of million 
no depletion expense and depreciation of million was recognized during the year ended december  impairment of oil and gas properties during the year  we incurred no asset impairment expense versus million during the year ended december  in  any impairment to exploration properties is transferred to our full cost pool which is subject to ceiling test limitations 
no impairment was recognized under our ceiling test in our asset impairment in consisted of million as a result of our decision not to exercise our option on two exploration blocks in the arab republic of egypt and cease our exploration activities in oman and yemen 
the balance from of million was a result of assessing our indian properties on an individual basis considering various factors  including land relinquishment and the absence of hydrocarbons in certain exploratory wells 
since the result of this assessment indicated impairment  the related costs incurred were charged to the statement of operations 
capitalized overhead on oil and gas properties we capitalize overhead costs directly related to our exploration activities in india 
during the year ended december   these capitalized overhead costs amounted to million as compared to million during the year ended december  the difference is mostly attributable to an increase in the capitalized portion of the stock based compensation for our non employee consultants directly related in our oil and gas exploration activities for the year ended december  of million versus million for the year ended december  the treatment of capitalized overhead costs remained consistent with the prior year and includes costs relating to personnel  consultants  their travel  necessary resources and stock based compensation directly associated with the advancement of our oil and gas interests 
results of operations for the years ended december  and reflecting the increase in our general and administrative expenses  professional fees and consulting fees due to the increase in our overall oil and gas exploration activities combined with a decrease in interest income and an asset impairment  our net loss amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the same period in during the year ended december   we had expenses of million compared with expenses of million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of the increased scale of our participation in oil and gas exploration activities and additions to the office infrastructure combined with an asset impairment of million 
interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in this decrease is directly related to the decrease in us prime interest rate in as compared to as well a decrease in our invested cash balances 

table of contents general and administrative our general and administrative expenses increased to from million 
these general and administrative expenses include costs related to the corporate head office including administrative salaries and services  rent and office costs  insurance  bank guarantee fees  nyse amex listing and filing fees and transfer agent fees and services 
also included in our general and administrative expenses are our compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements with employees and directors which are being expensed over their respective vesting periods of the related option grants 
these stock based compensation costs decreased to from million for the same period in the majority of the increase in the general and administrative expenses  which is offset by the decrease in stock based compensation costs  is a result of an increase in bank guarantee fees of million  listing fees related to the new stock option plan of million  and salaries and benefits of million due to increase in staff levels over the prior year 
consulting fees our consulting fees increased to million during the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
this change is mostly attributable to the decrease in reversal of compensation costs for stock based compensation with non employee consultants for the year ended december  being a reversal of million versus a reversal of million for the year ended december  a portion of this increase is a result of the accounting for the consulting fees paid under our technical services agreement with a corporation wholly owned by mr 
roy  who is employed as a consultant to us  whereby we expensed million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  the balance of the increase is a result of other fees and expenses we incurred in employing various technical and corporate consultants who advised us on a variety of matters 
professional fees professional fees increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  professional fees include those paid to our auditors for pre approved audit  accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements 
legal fees increased approximately million in as compared to the prior year as a result of engaging a lawyer to assist in the negotiations of a settlement with respect to the carried interest agreement dispute 
this was partially offset by a decrease in audit and audit related fees in the same amount in versus the prior year 
impairment of oil and gas properties during the year  we incurred an asset impairment expense of million versus nil during the year ended december  of this amount  million is a result of our decision not to exercise our option on the two exploration blocks in the arab republic of egypt and cease our exploration activities in oman and yemen 
the balance of million is a result of assessing our indian properties on an individual basis considering various factors  including land relinquishment and absence of proved reserves among others 
if the result of this assessment indicates impairment  then the related costs incurred are charged to the statement of operations 
capitalized overhead on oil and gas properties we capitalized overhead costs directly related to our exploration activities in india 
during the year ended december   these capitalized overhead costs were million as compared to million during the year ended december  the difference is mostly attributable to a decrease in the capitalized portion of the stock based compensation for our non employee consultants directly related in our oil and gas exploration activities for the year ended december  to versus million for the same period in reserve report as a result of the approval of the tarapur field development plan by the management committee in april and the completion of an independent reserve study dated january  by chapman petroleum engineering ltd 
out of calgary  alberta  canada  we claim reserves in the tarapur field as at december  as follows summary of oil and gas reserves as of december  reserves category oil mbbls natural gas mmcf proved developed undeveloped total proved probable developed undeveloped possible developed undeveloped 
table of contents proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geo science and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible 
probable reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which  together with proved reserves  are as likely as not to be recovered 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to meet potential cash requirements 
we have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of common stock as well as proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common equity 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to complete further exploration and development activities and generate profitable operations from our oil and natural gas interests in the future 
our current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of our current assets to meet our current expenditure requirements and the accuracy of management s estimates of those requirements 
should those estimates be materially incorrect  our ability to continue as a going concern will be impaired 
our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have incurred a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
these matters may raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million december  million 
the majority of this balance is being held in us funds  of which million is held in term deposits earning interest based on the us prime rate which will contribute towards covering a portion of our administrative costs and overhead throughout we have working capital of approximately million which is available for the company s future operations 
in addition  we have million in restricted deposits pledged as security against the minimum work programs for our exploration blocks which will be released upon completion of those minimum work programs 
we expect to incur expenditures to further our exploration programs 
our existing cash balance and any cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to satisfy our current obligations and meet our exploration commitments of million over the next four years 
we are considering various alternatives with respect to raising additional capital to remedy any future shortfall in capital but to date have made no specific plans or arrangements 
we deem it necessary to raise capital through equity markets  debt markets or other financing arrangements  including participation arrangements that may be available for continued exploration expenditures 
because of the early stage of our operations and our absence of any material oil and natural gas reserves  there can be no assurance this capital will be available and if it is not  we may be forced to substantially curtail or cease exploration  appraisal and development expenditures 
we believe that we will be able to raise additional capital which combined with our available cash resources will be sufficient funds to maintain our current level of activities through the next fiscal year 
should the going concern assumption not be appropriate and we are not able to realize our assets and settle our liabilities  commitments and contingencies  as more fully described in our consolidated financial statements in the normal course of operations  our consolidated financial statements would require adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities  and these adjustments could be significant 
our consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments or reclassifications of assets and liabilities that would be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern 
years ended december  and during the year ended december   our overall position in cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  as compared to a net decrease in the comparable period of of million 
these cash movements can be attributed to the following activities our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to and consistent with the increase in our current liabilities at december  to million from million at december  
table of contents cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million during the year ended december  funds of million were used for exploration activities as compared to million in this decrease is consistent with the decrease in exploration activity in the year versus the year in addition  the decrease of the requirement to supply bank guarantees consistent with such decrease in exploration activity  such that in the year ended december  funds were provided of million versus an outlay for such instruments of million in the year ended december  these bank guarantees have been provided and serve as guarantees for the performance of our minimum work programs and are in the form of irrevocable letters of credit which are secured by our term deposits in the same amount 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was nil as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   no shares were issued versus the issuance of  shares of common stock on the exercise of options in the prior year for gross proceeds of million 
there were no private placement sales of our securities during or years ended december  and during the year ended december   our overall position in cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  as compared to a net increase in the comparable period of of million 
these cash movements can be attributed to the following activities our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to an increase of approximately million in our general and administrative expenses  consulting and professional fees due to increased oil and gas exploration activities  combined with a significant decrease of approximately million in our interest income for the year ended december  as compared to cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was compared to million during the year ended december  funds of million were used for exploration activities and million for the acquisition of other property and equipment in as compared to and million  respectively in this increase is consistent with our increased exploration costs in the cambay and rajasthan basins 
in addition  the increased investing activity in the year ended december  was an increase in the requirement to supply bank guarantees  such that in the year ended december  outlays were increased by million versus outlays for such instruments of only million for the year ended december  these bank guarantees have been provided and serve as guarantees for the performance of our minimum work programs and are in the form of irrevocable letters of credit which are secured by our term deposits in the same amount 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we issued  shares on the exercise of options for gross proceeds of million as compared to million on the issuance of  shares of common stock on the exercise of options in the prior year 
there were no private placement sales of our securities during as compared to  whereby we completed the sale of  units of our securities at per unit for aggregate cash gross proceeds of million less share issuance costs of million relating to the financing 
capital resources we expect our exploration and development activities pursuant to the pscs we are a party to  and the related drilling activities in the ten exploration blocks that we hold an interest in  will continue through in accordance with the terms of those agreements 
during the period january  to december   based on the current budgets  we anticipate drilling ten exploratory wells and ten core wells  conducting a  line kilometer aeromagnetic survey  and acquire process and interpret  line kilometers of d seismic and square kilometers of d seismic 
we further expect to commence the construction of the gas gathering and production facilities together with further development drilling on the kg offshore block for which we are carried 
additional expenditures may be incurred in connection with additional exploratory  appraisal and development wells we may participate in 
also  if we increase our participating interest in the kg onshore block to  our obligations to fund the d seismic acquisition and the exploratory drilling on the block will increase 
in addition  we may seek to participate in joint ventures bidding for the award of further pscs for exploration blocks expected to be awarded by the government of india in the future 
as of march   we have no specific plans to join with others in bidding for any specific pscs in india and elsewhere 
we expect that our interest in any such ventures would involve a minority participating interest in the venture 
in addition  although there are no present plans to do so  as opportunities arise  we may seek to acquire minority participating interests in exploration blocks where pscs have been heretofore awarded 
the acquisition of any such interests would be subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and obtaining the requisite government consents and other approvals 
we may during the year seek to participate in joint venture bidding for the acquisition of oil and gas interests in other international countries  however  as of march   we have made no specific plans regarding such activities and have not entered into any binding agreements with respect to such activities 

table of contents as of march   the scope of any possible such activities has not been definitively established and  accordingly  we are unable to state the amount of any funds that will be required for these purposes 
as a result  no specific plans or arrangements have been made to raise additional capital and we have not entered into any agreements in that regard 
we expect that when we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities  debt or other financing arrangements 
we are unable to estimate the terms on which such capital will be raised  the price per share or possible number of shares involved or the terms of any agreements to raise capital under other arrangements 
during the first quarter of  we hired a new senior executive 
we do not expect to have any further significant change in in our number of employees

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are outlined in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of our operations and cash flows in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
asset retirement obligation the fair values of estimated asset retirement obligations are recorded as liabilities when incurred and the associated cost is capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
the liabilities are accreted as operating expense for the change in their time value 
the initial capitalized costs are included in depletion expense in a manner consistent with the related assets 
changes in the estimated obligation resulting from revisions to the estimated timing or amount of undiscounted cash flows are recognized as a change in the asset retirement obligation and related asset 
actual expenditures incurred are charged against the accumulated obligation 
stock based compensation compensation cost for all share based payments are based on the fair value estimated and is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period for the award 
we account for transactions in which we issue equity instruments to acquire goods or services from non employees based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the fair value of share based payments are capitalized or expensed  with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital for the equity classified awards  or the share based payment liability for the liability classified awards 
upon exercise of stock options  the consideration paid upon exercise is recorded as additional value of common shares in additional paid in capital 

table of contents oil and gas accounting and impairment we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
under this method  we capitalize all acquisition  exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities  however  are expensed in the period incurred 
to the extent that support equipment is used in oil and gas activities  the related depreciation is capitalized 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized unless such disposition would alter the depletion and depreciation rate by or more 
capitalized costs of development oil and natural gas properties may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proven reserves plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproven properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment is recognized 
the present value of estimated future net cash flows is computed by applying the average first day of the month prices during the previous twelve month period of oil and natural gas to estimated future production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as of year end less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
following the discovery of reserves and the commencement of production  we compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
we assess all items classified as unproved property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others land relinquishment  intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the related exploration costs incurred are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to depletion and the ceiling limitations on development oil and natural gas expenditures

acquisition costs are no longer considered part of the fair value of consideration transferred and will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
contingent assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the measurement period

 fair value measurements and disclosures measuring liabilities and fair value  amending subtopic  fair value measurement  to provide guidance on the manner in which the fair value of liabilities should be determined 
this update provides clarification that  in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of defined valuation techniques 
the amendments in this update also clarify that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability

table of contents in december  we adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements 
the primary impact of the new disclosures for us is to align the definition of proved reserves with the us securities and exchange commission sec modernization of oil and gas reporting rules  which were issued by the sec at the end of the accounting standards update revised the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to require that the average  first day of the month price during the month period preceding the end of the year rather than the year end price  must be used when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce 
this same month average price is also used in calculating the aggregate amount of and changes in future cash inflows related to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
the rules also allow for the use of reliable technology to estimate proved oil and gas reserves  if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
the unaudited supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities for have been presented following these new reserve estimations and disclosure rules  which may not be applied retrospectively 
adoption of the new rules had no effect on the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices 
we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with the following interest rate risk we consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be immaterial 
interest rate exposures relate entirely to our investment portfolio  as we do not have short term or long term debt 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality bank issuers at overnight rates  or government securities of the united states or canadian federal governments such as guaranteed investment certificates or treasury bills 
we do not hold any of these investments for trading purposes 
we do not hold equity investments 
we do not expect any material loss from cash equivalents and therefore we believe our interest rate exposure on invested funds is not material 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially  all of our cash and cash equivalents are held in us dollars or us dollar denominated securities 
certain of our expenses are fixed or denominated by foreign currencies including the canadian dollar and the indian rupees 
we are exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
at december   we had not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments relating to our foreign currency exchange risk 

table of contents commodity price risk oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  international supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  overall economic conditions  both international and domestic  and possible international disruptions 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our ability to obtain capital to fund our activities and could in the future require a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
similarly  an improvement in oil and gas prices can have a favourable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
at december   we had not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments as such term is defined in item of regulation s k  relating to oil and natural gas 
trading risks we have no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes
