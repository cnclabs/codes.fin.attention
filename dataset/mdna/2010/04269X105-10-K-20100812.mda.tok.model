the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report 
the terms we  us  our and similar terms refer to array biopharma inc overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs to treat patients afflicted with cancer and inflammatory diseases 
our proprietary drug development pipeline includes clinical candidates that are designed to regulate therapeutically important target pathways 
in addition  leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies partner with us to discover and develop drug candidates across a broad range of therapeutic areas 
the six most advanced programs that we are developing alone or with a partner are as follows program indication partner clinical status amg arry glucokinase activator for type diabetes amgen inc phase mek arry mek inhibitor for cancer novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
phase arry her inhibitor for breast cancer none  array owned phase arry kinesin spindle protein  or ksp  inhibitor for multiple myeloma  or mm none  array owned phase arry her egfr inhibitor for solid tumors none  array owned phase arry p tie dual inhibitor for myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds none  array owned phase 
table of contents in addition to these development programs  the seven most advanced partnered drugs in clinical development are as follows program indication partner clinical status azd arry mek inhibitor for cancer astrazeneca  plc phase azd mek inhibitor for cancer astrazeneca  plc phase danoprevir rg itmn hepatitis c virus hcv protease inhibitor intermune  inc in partnership with roche holding ag phase gdc akt kinase inhibitor for cancer genentech inc phase ly ic checkpoint kinase  or chk  inhibitor for cancer eli lilly and company phase vtx toll like receptor for cancer ventirx pharmaceuticals  inc phase vtx toll like receptor for allergy ventirx pharmaceuticals  inc phase any information we report about the development plans or the progress or results of clinical trials or other development activities of our partners is based on information that has been reported to us or is otherwise publicly disclosed by our partners 
we also have a portfolio of proprietary and partnered drug discovery programs that we believe will generate an average of one to two investigational new drug  or ind  applications per year 
we have active  partnered drug discovery programs with amgen  celgene and genentech in which we may earn milestone payments and royalties 
our internal discovery efforts have also generated additional early stage drug candidates and we may choose to out license select promising candidates through research partnerships prior to filing an ind application 
our internal drug discovery programs include an inhibitor that targets the kinase chk for the treatment of cancer and a program directed to discovering inhibitors of a family of tyrosine kinase  or trk  receptors for the treatment of pain 
our chk inhibitor is a first in class  selective  oral drug candidate and in preclinical studies has shown prolonged inhibition of the chk target 
we have built our clinical and discovery programs through spending million from our inception through june  in fiscal  we spent million in research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses  compared to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal  we signed strategic collaborations with novartis and amgen 
together these collaborations provided array with million in initial payments  over billion in potential milestone payments if all clinical and commercialization milestones under the agreements are achieved  double digit royalties and commercial co detailing rights 
we have received a total of million in research funding and in up front and milestone payments from our collaboration partners since inception through june  under our existing collaboration agreements  we have the potential to earn over billion in additional milestone payments if we or our collaborators achieve all the drug discovery  development and commercialization objectives detailed in those agreements  as well as the potential to earn royalties on any resulting product sales from drug development programs 
our significant collaborators include amgen  which entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration with us to develop and commercialize our glucokinase activator  amg astrazeneca  which licensed three of our mek inhibitors for cancer  including azd  which is currently in multiple phase clinical trials 
celgene corporation  which entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration agreement with us focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer and inflammation 
genentech  which entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration agreement with us focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics 
one drug  gdc  an 
table of contents akt inhibitor for cancer  entered a phase trial during the first half of the other programs are in preclinical development 
intermune  which collaborated with us on the discovery of danoprevir rg itmn  a novel small molecule inhibitor of the hepatitis c virus ns protease  which is currently in phase b clinical trials and which intermune is developing in partnership with roche holding ag 
novartis  which entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration with us to develop and commercialize our mek inhibitor  mek and other mek inhibitors identified in the agreement 
our fiscal year ends on june when we refer to a fiscal year or quarter  we are referring to the year in which the fiscal year ends and the quarters during that fiscal year 
therefore  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended june  business development and collaborator concentrations we currently license or partner certain of our compounds and or programs and enter into collaborations directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in addition  we may license our compounds and enter into collaborations in japan through an agent 
the following collaborators contributed greater than of our total revenue for the periods presented years ended june  genentech amgen celgene ventirx ono in general  certain of our collaborators may terminate their collaboration agreements with to days prior notice 
our agreement with genentech can be terminated with days notice 
celgene may terminate its agreement with us with six months notice 
amgen may terminate its agreement with us at any time upon notice of or days depending on the development activities going on at the time of such notice 
the following table details revenue from our collaborators by region based on the country in which collaborators are located or the ship to destination for compounds dollars in thousands years ended june  north america europe asia pacific all of our collaboration agreements are denominated in us dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our accompanying financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 

table of contents these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies and estimates that we believe involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition most of our revenue is from our collaborators for research funding  up front or license fees and milestone payments derived from discovering and developing drug candidates 
our agreements with collaboration partners include fees based on contracted annual rates for full time equivalent employees working on a program and may also include non refundable license and up front fees  non refundable milestone payments that are triggered upon achievement of specific research or development goals and future royalties on sales of products that result from the collaboration 
a small portion of our revenue comes from the sale of compounds on a per compound basis 
we report revenue for discovery  the sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license  as collaboration revenue 
license and milestone revenue is combined and consists of up front fees and ongoing milestone payments from collaborators that are recognized during the applicable period 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab establishes four criteria  each of which must be met  in order to recognize revenue for the performance of services or the shipment of products 
revenue is recognized when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b products are delivered or services are rendered  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collectability is reasonably assured 
collaboration agreements that include a combination of discovery research funding  up front or license fees  milestone payments and or royalties are evaluated to determine whether each deliverable under the agreement has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether reliable evidence of fair value for the deliverable exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria are treated as a single unit of accounting  generally applying applicable revenue recognition guidance for the final deliverable to the combined unit of accounting in accordance with sab we recognize revenue from non refundable up front payments and license fees on a straight line basis over the term of performance under the agreement  which is generally the estimated research term 
these advance payments are deferred and recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt  pending recognition and are classified as a short term or long term liability in the accompanying balance sheets 
when the performance period is not specifically identifiable from the agreement  we estimate the performance period based upon provisions contained within the agreement  such as the duration of the research term  the specific number of full time equivalent scientists working a defined number of hours per year at a stated price under the agreement  the existence  or likelihood of achievement  of development commitments and other significant commitments of ours 
we also have agreements that provide for milestone payments 
in certain cases  a portion of each milestone payment is recognized as revenue when the specific milestone is achieved based on the applicable percentage of the estimated research or development term that has elapsed to the total estimated research and or development term 
in other cases  when the milestone payment finances the future development obligations of the company  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining development period 
certain milestone payments are related to activities for which there are no future obligations and as a result  are recognized when earned in their entirety 
we periodically review the expected performance periods under each of our agreements that provide for non refundable up front payments and license fees and milestone payments and adjusts the amortization periods when appropriate to reflect changes in assumptions relating to the duration of expected 
table of contents performance periods 
revenue recognition related to non refundable license fees and up front payments and milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs or alternatively  decelerated  if programs are extended 
as such  while such estimates have no impact on our reported cash flows  our reported revenue is significantly influenced by our estimates of the period over which our obligations will be performed 
cost of revenue and research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery we incur costs in connection with performing research and development activities which consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based compensation  preclinical and clinical outsourcing costs and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation costs and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
we allocate these costs between cost of revenue and research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery based upon the respective time spent by our scientists on development conducted for our collaborations and for our internal proprietary programs  respectively 
cost of revenue represents the costs associated with research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  conducted by us for our collaborators 
research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery consist of direct and indirect costs related to our specific proprietary programs 
we do not bear any risk of failure for performing these activities and the payments are not contingent on the success or failure of the research program 
accordingly  we expense these costs when incurred 
where our collaboration agreements provide for us to conduct research or development and for which our partner has an option to obtain the right to conduct further development and to commercialize a product  we attribute a portion of its research and development costs to cost of revenue based on the percentage of total programs under the agreement that we conclude is likely to be selected by the partner 
these costs may not be incurred equally across all programs 
in addition  we continually evaluate the progress of development activities under these agreements and if events or circumstances change in future periods that we reasonably believe would make it unlikely that a collaborator would exercise an option with respect to the same percentage of programs  we will adjust the allocation accordingly 
for example  we granted celgene corporation an option to select up to two of four programs developed under our collaboration agreement with celgene and concluded that celgene was likely to exercise its option with respect to two of the four programs 
accordingly  we reported costs associated with the celgene collaboration as follows to cost of revenue  with the remaining to research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery through september   when celgene waived its rights with respect to one of the programs during the second quarter of fiscal  at which time  management determined that celgene is likely to exercise its option to license one of the remaining three programs 
as a result  beginning october   we began reporting costs associated with the celgene collaboration as follows to cost of revenue  with the remaining to research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery 
see note deferred revenue for further information about the company s collaboration with celgene 
accrued outsourcing costs substantial portions of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are performed by third party laboratories  medical centers  contract research organizations and other vendors collectively cros 
these cros generally bill monthly or quarterly for services performed or bill based upon milestone achievement 
for preclinical studies  we accrue expenses based upon estimated percentage of work completed and the contract milestones remaining 
for clinical studies  expenses are accrued based upon the number of patients enrolled and the duration of the study 
we monitor patient enrollment  the progress of clinical studies and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews of data reported to us by the cros  correspondence with the cros and clinical site visits 
our estimates depend on the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by the cros regarding the status of each program and total program spending 
we periodically evaluate our estimates to determine if adjustments are necessary or appropriate based on information we receive 

table of contents marketable securities we have designated our marketable securities as of each balance sheet date as available for sale securities and account for them at their respective fair values 
marketable securities are classified as short term or long term based on the nature of these securities and the availability of these securities to meet current operating requirements 
marketable securities that are readily available for use in current operations are classified as short term available for sale securities and are reported as a component of current assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
marketable securities that are not considered available for use in current operations are classified as long term available for sale securities and are reported as a component of long term assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at fair value  including accrued interest  with temporary unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders deficit until their disposition 
we review all available for sale securities each period to determine if they remain available for sale based on our current intent and ability to sell the security if we are required to do so 
the amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
realized gains on ars are reported in gains losses on auction rate securities in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss as incurred along with declines in value judged to be other than temporary when such declines are recognized 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
under the fair value hierarchy  our ars are measured using level iii  or unobservable inputs  as there is no active market for the securities 
the most significant unobservable inputs used in this method are estimates of the amount of time until a liquidity event will occur and the discount rate  which incorporates estimates of credit risk and a liquidity premium discount 
due to the inherent complexity in valuing these securities  we engaged a third party valuation firm to perform an independent valuation of the ars as part of our overall fair value analysis beginning with the first quarter of fiscal and continuing through all quarters of the current fiscal year 
while we believe that the estimates used in the fair value analysis are reasonable  a change in any of the assumptions underlying these estimates would result in different fair value estimates for the ars and could result in additional adjustments to the ars  either increasing or further decreasing their value  possibly by material amounts 
see note marketable securities for additional information about our investments in ars as well as other income expense in the results of operations discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
fair value measurements our financial instruments are recognized and measured at fair value in our financial statements and mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments  trade receivables and payables  long term debt  embedded derivatives associated with the long term debt and warrants 
we use different valuation techniques to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities  as discussed in more detail below 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the financial instruments in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we use a framework for measuring fair value based on a hierarchy that distinguishes sources of available information used in fair value measurements and categorizes them into three levels level i quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
level ii observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
level iii unobservable inputs 
we disclose assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value for assets or liabilities for 
table of contents which there are no quoted prices in active markets  which include our ars  warrants issued by us or embedded derivatives associated with our long term debt 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on their estimated fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimates disclosed by us may not be indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instruments could realize in a current market exchange 
we periodically review the realizability of each investment when impairment indicators exist with respect to the investment 
if an other than temporary impairment of the value of an investment is deemed to exist  the cost basis of the investment is written down to its then estimated fair value 
long term debt and embedded derivatives the terms of our long term debt are discussed in detail in note long term debt included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the accounting for these arrangements is complex and is based upon significant estimates by management 
we review all debt agreements to determine the appropriate accounting treatment when the agreement is entered into and review all amendments to determine if the changes require accounting for the amendment as a modification  or extinguishment and new debt 
we also review each long term debt arrangement to determine if any feature of the debt requires bifurcation and or separate valuation 
these features include hybrid instruments  which are comprised of at least two components a debt host instrument and one or more conversion features  warrants and other embedded derivatives  such as puts and other rights of the debt holder 
we currently have two embedded derivatives related to our long term debt with deerfield 
the first is a variable interest rate structure that constitutes a liquidity linked variable spread feature 
the second derivative is a significant transaction contingent put option relating to the ability of deerfield to accelerate repayment of the debt in the event of certain changes in control of our company 
collectively  they are referred to as the embedded derivatives 
under the fair value hierarchy  our embedded derivatives are measured using level iii  or unobservable inputs  as there is no active market for them 
the fair value of the variable interest rate structure is based on our estimate of the probable effective interest rate over the term of the deerfield credit facilities 
the fair value of the put option is based on our estimate of the probability that a change in control that triggers deerfield s right to accelerate the debt will occur 
with those inputs  the fair value of each embedded derivative is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the deerfield credit facilities if the embedded derivatives are included and the fair value of the deerfield credit facilities if the embedded derivatives are excluded 
due to the inherent complexity in valuing the deerfield credit facilities and the embedded derivatives  we engaged a third party valuation firm to perform the valuation as part of our overall fair value analysis as of july   the date funds were disbursed under the credit facility entered into in may and for each subsequent quarter end through june  the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined based on management s judgment and assumptions and the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different estimated fair values 
the fair value of the embedded derivatives was initially recorded as derivative liabilities and as debt discount in our balance sheets 
any change in the value of the embedded derivatives is adjusted quarterly as appropriate and recorded to derivative liabilities in the balance sheets and interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
the debt discount is being amortized from the draw date of july  to the end of the term of the deerfield credit facilities using the effective interest method and recorded as interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
warrants we issue in connection with our long term debt arrangements are reviewed to determine if they should be classified as liabilities or as equity 
all outstanding warrants issued by us have been classified as equity 
we value the warrants at issuance based on a black scholes option pricing model and then allocate a portion of the proceeds under the debt to the warrants based upon their relative fair values 
any transaction fees paid in connection with our long term debt arrangements that quality for capitalization are recorded as other long term assets in the balance sheets and amortized to interest expense in the

collaboration revenue fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in collaboration revenue of million  or  for the year ended june  was from million of revenue from our new collaboration with amgen and thousand of additional revenue under our collaboration with genentech  of which the million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal was for the finalization of contract rates for services rendered in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was offset by fewer scientists engaged on the genentech program beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and thousand less revenue due to the expiration of our research term with ventirx 
fiscal compared to fiscal collaboration revenue decreased by million or in fiscal primarily due to lower revenue of million resulting from the expiration our collaboration with ono pharmaceuticals and of thousand due to decreased activity under our collaboration with ventirx 
these declines were partially offset by an increase of thousand for the expansion of the genentech collaboration in the first quarter of fiscal license and milestone revenue license and milestone revenue are combined and consist of up front license fees and ongoing milestone payments from collaborators

table of contents milestone revenue increased in fiscal by million over the prior year 
the increase includes million in milestones recognized for the advancement of certain research programs under our collaboration with genentech  compared with thousand of milestone revenue under our genentech collaboration recognized in fiscal additionally  we recognized million in milestone revenue from intermune during fiscal and similarly  recognized million in milestone revenue from ventirx during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal license and milestone revenue for fiscal remained relatively consistent with fiscal in total 
during fiscal  license and milestone revenue included an increase of thousand from additional license revenue following expansion of our collaboration with genentech and from additional milestone revenue received from genentech that was recognized in fiscal  and an increase in license revenue of million under our celgene collaboration  which did not begin until the second quarter of fiscal  and a decrease in license revenue of million that was fully recognized in under our program with ventirx 
cost of revenue cost of revenue represents costs attributable to discovery and development including preclinical and clinical trials we may conduct for our collaborators and the cost of chemical compounds sold from our inventory 
these costs consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based compensation  preclinical and clinical outsourcing costs and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  travel and meals  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation costs and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs

cost of revenue cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars and decreased as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in absolute dollars was for discovery  preclinical and clinical costs for the advancement of certain collaboration programs  including celgene and our new programs with amgen and novartis 
these increases were offset by the change in the estimate for the celgene cost allocation from to cost of revenue and to research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery to and  respectively  as discussed further in note deferred revenue to the accompanying financial statements 
in addition  there were fewer scientists engaged on our collaboration with genentech and our research term with ventirx  which expired in september the decrease as a percentage of total revenue was because of greater license and milestone revenue recognized during the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal cost of revenue decreased in absolute dollars but increased as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal the increases in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue were primarily due to the decrease in license revenue from ventirx  which had no associated costs and increased costs associated with advancement of our partnered programs  including our collaboration with celgene  as well as thousand in restructuring charges as discussed in note restructuring charges in the accompanying financial statements

we manage our proprietary programs based on scientific data and achievement of research plan goals 
our scientists record their time to specific projects when possible  however  many activities simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific project 
accordingly  the accurate assignment of time and costs to a specific project is difficult and may not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project 
as a result  we do not report costs on a program basis

additionally  we reduced overall spending as we focused on the development efforts for our most advanced programs and reduced resources devoted to early discovery research  which occurred after the second quarter of fiscal we expect our spending on research and development expenses for our proprietary programs will remain relatively constant with the fourth quarter of fiscal levels during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery for fiscal remained consistent with the prior year due to shifting our development efforts towards our most advanced programs and reduced resources devoted to early discovery research  which occurred in the middle of fiscal these efforts resulted in the progression of our most advanced programs

we had net losses of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we have historically funded our operations through payments received under our collaborations and out licensing transactions  the issuance of equity securities and through debt provided by our credit facilities 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we will continue to utilize our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that were generated primarily from these sources 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and excluding the value of the ars we hold  will enable us to continue to fund our 
table of contents operations for at least the next months 
in december  we received a million up front payment from amgen under a collaboration and license agreement 
in april  we entered into a license agreement with novartis under which we received million in an upfront and milestone payment in the fourth quarter of fiscal the recognition of revenue under these agreements is discussed further in note deferred revenue to the accompanying financial statements 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into future collaborations  however  or that other funds will be available to us when needed 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding from these or other sources to the extent or when needed  it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending through further reductions in staff and delaying  scaling back or stopping certain research and development programs 
insufficient funds may also require us to relinquish greater rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms to us or our stockholders than we would otherwise choose in order to obtain up front license fees needed to fund our operations 
our ability to realize milestone or royalty payments under existing collaboration agreements and to enter into new partnering arrangements that generate additional revenue through up front fees and milestone or royalty payments  is subject to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control and include the following the drug development process is risky and highly uncertain and we may not be successful in generating proof of concept data to create partnering opportunities and even if we are  we or our collaborators may not be successful in commercializing drug candidates we create  our collaborators have substantial control and discretion over the timing and continued development and marketing of drug candidates we create and  therefore  we may not receive milestone  royalty or other payments when anticipated or at all  the drug candidates we develop may not obtain regulatory approval  and  if regulatory approval is received  drugs we develop will remain subject to regulation or may not gain market acceptance  which could delay or prevent us from generating milestone  royalty revenue or product revenue from the commercialization of these drugs 
our assessment of our future need for funding is a forward looking statement that is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements could vary as a result of a number of factors  including our ability to enter into agreements to out license  co develop or commercialize our proprietary drug candidates and the timing of payments under those agreements throughout each candidate s development stage  the number and scope of our research and development programs  the progress and success of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the progress of the development efforts of our collaborators  our ability to maintain current collaboration agreements  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and or the expenses associated with unforeseen litigation  regulatory changes  competition and technological developments  general economic and market conditions and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash equivalents are short term  highly liquid financial instruments that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of days or less from the date of purchase 
marketable securities classified as short term consist primarily of various financial instruments such as commercial paper  us government agency obligations and corporate notes and bonds with high credit quality with maturities of greater than days when purchased 
marketable securities classified as long term consist primarily of our investments in ars 
see note marketable securities in the accompanying financial statements for more information regarding our ars

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices  the liquidity of ars we hold and fluctuations in interest rates 
all of our collaboration agreements and nearly all purchase orders are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  historically and as of june   we have had little or no exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency or exchange rates 

table of contents our investment portfolio  without regard to our ars  is comprised primarily of readily marketable  high quality securities diversified and structured to minimize market risks 
we target our average portfolio maturity at one year or less 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments in marketable securities 
marketable securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to changes in market value in response to changes in interest rates and liquidity 
as of june   million of our investment portfolio was invested in ars that are not marketable as discussed below 
in addition  a significant change in market interest rates could have a material impact on interest income earned from our investment portfolio 
a theoretical basis point change in interest rates and security prices would impact our annual net loss positively or negatively by million based on the current balance of million of investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities available for sale
