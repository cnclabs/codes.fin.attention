item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if  as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions  we are unable to receive sufficient dividends and or distributions from our businesses  we may be limited in our ability to reduce the level of any outstanding debt and declare distributions on our llc interests 
in addition  we may be unable to pay our management fees to our manager 
if our manager resigned  it would trigger a change in control default provision under the credit facilities of some of our businesses  which would permit the relevant lenders to accelerate the indebtedness 

table of contents we own  and may acquire in the future  investments in which we share voting control with third parties and  consequently  our ability to exercise significant influence over the business or level of their distributions to us may be limited 
we own of imtt and of district energy and may acquire less than majority ownership in other businesses in the future 
our ability to influence the management of jointly owned businesses  and the ability of these businesses to continue operating without disruption  depends on our reaching agreement with our co investors and reconciling investment and performance objectives for these businesses 
to the extent that we are unable to agree with co investors regarding the business and operations of the relevant investment  the performance of the investment and the operations may suffer  and could have a material adverse effect on our results 
furthermore  we may  from time to time  own non controlling interests in investments 
management and controlling shareholders of these investments may develop different objectives than we have and may not make distributions to us at levels that we had anticipated 
our inability to exercise significant influence over the operations  strategies and policies of non controlled investments means that decisions could be made that could adversely affect our results and our ability to generate cash and pay distributions on our llc interests 
our businesses are dependent on our relationships  on a contractual and regulatory level  with government entities that may have significant leverage over us 
government entities may be influenced by political considerations to take actions adverse to us 
our businesses generally are  and will continue to be  subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies 
in addition  our businesses rely on obtaining and maintaining government permits  licenses  concessions  leases or contracts 
government entities  due to the wide ranging scope of their authority  have significant leverage over us in their contractual and regulatory relationships with us that they may exercise in a manner that causes us delays in the operation of our businesses or pursuit of our strategy  or increased administrative expense 
furthermore  government permits  licenses  concessions  leases and contracts are generally very complex  which may result in periods of non compliance  or disputes over interpretation or enforceability 
if we fail to comply with these regulations or contractual obligations  we could be subject to monetary penalties or we may lose our rights to operate the affected business  or both 
where our ability to operate an infrastructure business is subject to a concession or lease from the government  the concession or lease may restrict our ability to operate the business in a way that maximizes cash flows and profitability 
further  our ability to grow our current and future businesses will often require consent of numerous government regulators 
increased regulation restricting the ownership or management of us assets  particularly infrastructure assets  by non us persons  given the non us ultimate ownership of our manager  may limit our ability to pursue acquisitions 
any such regulation may also limit our manager s ability to continue to manage our operations  which could cause disruption to our businesses and a decline in our performance 
in addition  any required government consents may be costly to seek and we may not be able to obtain them 
failure to obtain any required consents could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategy 
our contracts with government entities may also contain clauses more favorable to the government counterparty than a typical commercial contract 
for instance  a lease  concession or general service contract may enable the government to terminate the agreement without requiring them to pay adequate compensation 
in addition  government counterparties also may have the discretion to change or increase regulation of our operations  or implement laws or regulations affecting our operations  separate from any contractual rights they may have 
governments have considerable discretion in implementing regulations that could impact these businesses 
because our businesses provide basic services  and face limited competition  governments may be influenced by political considerations to take actions that may hinder the efficient and profitable operation of our businesses and investments 
governmental agencies may determine the prices we charge and may be able to restrict our ability to operate our businesses to maximize profitability 
where our businesses or investments are sole or predominant service providers in their respective service areas and provide services that are essential to the community  they are likely to be subject to rate regulation by governmental agencies that will determine the prices they may charge 
we may also face fees or other charges imposed by government agencies that increase our costs and over which we have no control 
we may 
table of contents be subject to increases in fees or unfavorable price determinations that may be final with no right of appeal or that  despite a right of appeal  could result in our profits being negatively affected 
in addition  we may have very little negotiating leverage in establishing contracts with government entities  which may decrease the prices that we otherwise might be able to charge or the terms upon which we provide products or services 
businesses and investments we acquire in the future may also be subject to rate regulation or similar negotiating limitations 
our businesses are subject to environmental risks that may impact our future profitability 
our businesses including businesses in which we invest are subject to numerous statutes  rules and regulations relating to environmental protection 
atlantic aviation is subject to environmental protection requirements relating to the storage  transport  pumping and transfer of fuel  and district energy is subject to requirements relating mainly to its handling of significant amounts of hazardous materials 
the gas company is subject to risks and hazards associated with the refining  handling  storage and transportation of combustible products 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury  loss of life  damage or destruction of property and equipment  and environmental damage 
any losses we face could be greater than insurance levels maintained by our businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their and our financial results 
in addition  disruptions to physical assets could reduce our ability to serve customers and adversely affect sales and cash flows 
imtt s operations in particular are subject to complex  stringent and expensive environmental regulation and future compliance costs are difficult to estimate with certainty 
imtt also faces risks relating to the handling and transportation of significant amounts of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with regulations or other claims may give rise to interruptions in operations and civil or criminal penalties and liabilities that could adversely affect the profitability of this business and the distributions it makes to us  as could significant unexpected compliance costs 
further  these rules and regulations are subject to change and compliance with any changes could result in a restriction of the activities of our businesses  significant capital expenditures and or increased ongoing operating costs 
a number of the properties owned by imtt have been subject to environmental contamination in the past and require remediation for which imtt is liable 
these remediation obligations exist principally at imtt s bayonne and lemont facilities and could cost more than anticipated or could be incurred earlier than anticipated or both 
in addition  imtt may discover additional environmental contamination at its bayonne  lemont or other facilities that may require remediation at significant cost to imtt 
further  the past contamination of the properties owned by imtt  including by former owners or operators of such properties  could result in remediation obligations  personal injury  property damage  environmental damage or similar claims by third parties 
we may also be required to address other prior or future environmental contamination  including soil and groundwater contamination that results from the spillage of fuel  hazardous materials or other pollutants 
under various federal  state  local and foreign environmental statutes  rules and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements and for the costs of investigation  monitoring  removal or remediation of hazardous materials 
these laws often impose liability  whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous materials 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those materials at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person and whether or not the original disposal or treatment activity accorded with all regulatory requirements 
the presence of hazardous materials on a property could result in personal injury  loss of life  damage or destruction of property and equipment  environmental damage and similar claims by third parties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 

table of contents we may face a greater exposure to terrorism than other companies because of the nature of our businesses and investments 
we believe that infrastructure businesses face a greater risk of terrorist attack than other businesses  particularly those businesses that have operations within the immediate vicinity of metropolitan and suburban areas 
specifically  because of the combustible nature of the products of the gas company and consumer reliance on these products for basic services  the business sng plant  transmission pipelines  barges and storage facilities may be at greater risk for terrorism attacks than other businesses  which could affect its operations significantly 
any terrorist attacks that occur at or near our business locations would likely cause significant harm to our employees and assets 
as a result of the terrorist attacks in new york on september   insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events 
a terrorist attack that makes use of our property  or property under our control  may result in liability far in excess of available insurance coverage 
in addition  any further terrorist attack  regardless of location  could cause a disruption to our business and a decline in earnings 
furthermore  it is likely to result in an increase in insurance premiums and a reduction in coverage  which could cause our profitability to suffer 
we are dependent on certain key personnel  and the loss of key personnel  or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees  could have an adverse effect on our businesses  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate our businesses on a stand alone basis  relying on existing management teams for day to day operations 
consequently  our operational success  as well as the success of our internal growth strategy  will be dependent on the continued efforts of the management teams of our businesses  who have extensive experience in the day to day operations of these businesses 
furthermore  we will likely be dependent on the operating management teams of businesses that we may acquire in the future 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our income may be affected adversely if additional compliance costs are required as a result of new safety  health or environmental regulation 
our businesses and investments are subject to federal  state and local safety  health and environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations affect all aspects of their operations and are frequently modified 
there is a risk that any one of our businesses or investments may not be able to comply with some aspect of these laws and regulations  resulting in fines or penalties 
additionally  if new laws and regulations are adopted or if interpretations of existing laws and regulations change  we could be required to increase capital spending and incur increased operating expenses in order to comply 
because the regulatory environment frequently changes  we cannot predict when or how we may be affected by such changes 
a significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the revenue of a number of our businesses 
a significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the profitability of a number of our businesses 
higher prices for jet fuel could result in less use of aircraft by general aviation customers  which would have a negative impact on the profitability of atlantic aviation 
higher fuel prices could increase the cost of power to our businesses generally which they may not be able to fully pass on to customers 

table of contents risks related to imtt imtt s business is dependent on the demand for bulk liquid storage capacity in the locations where it operates 
demand for imtt s bulk liquid storage is largely a function of us domestic demand for chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and  less significantly  the extent to which such products are imported into and or exported out of the united states 
us domestic demand for chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products is influenced by a number of factors  including economic conditions  growth in the us economy  the pricing of chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and their substitutes 
import and export volumes of these products to and from the united states are influenced by demand and supply imbalances in the united states and overseas  the cost of producing chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products domestically vis vis overseas and the cost of transporting the products between the united states and overseas destinations 
in addition  changes in government regulations that affect imports and exports of bulk chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products  including the imposition of surcharges or taxes on imported or exported products  could adversely affect import and export volumes to and from the united states 
a reduction in demand for bulk liquid storage  particularly in the new york harbor or the lower mississippi river  as a consequence of lower us domestic demand for  or imports exports of  chemical  petroleum or vegetable and animal oil products  could lead to a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by imtt and adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business could be adversely affected by a substantial increase in bulk liquid storage capacity in the locations where it operates 
an increase in available bulk liquid storage capacity in excess of growth in demand for such storage in the key locations in which imtt operates  such as new york harbor and the lower mississippi river  could result in overcapacity and a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by imtt and could adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business could be adversely affected by the insolvency of one or more large customers 
imtt has a number of customers that together generate a material proportion of imtt s revenue and gross profit 
in  imtt s ten largest customers by revenue generated approximately of total revenue 
the insolvency of any of these large customers could result in an increase in unutilized storage capacity in the absence of such capacity being rented to other customers and adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business involves hazardous activities and is partly located in a region with a history of significant adverse weather events and is potentially a target for terrorist attacks 
we cannot assure you that imtt is  or will be in the future  adequately insured against all such risks 
the transportation  handling and storage of petroleum  chemical and vegetable and animal oil products are subject to the risk of spills  leakage  contamination  fires and explosions 
any of these events may result in loss of revenue  loss of reputation or goodwill  fines  penalties and other liabilities 
in certain circumstances  such events could also require imtt to halt or significantly alter operations at all or part of the facility at which the event occurred 
consistent with industry practice  imtt carries insurance to protect against most of the accident related risks involved in the conduct of the business  however  the limits of imtt s coverage mean imtt cannot insure against all risks 
in addition  because imtt s facilities are not insured against loss from terrorism or acts of war  such an attack that significantly damages one or more of imtt s major facilities would have a negative impact on imtt s future cash flow and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
further  future losses sustained by insurers during hurricanes in the us gulf region may result in lower insurance coverage and or increased insurance premiums for imtt s properties in louisiana 

table of contents risks related to the gas company disruptions or shutdowns at either of the oil refineries on oahu from which the gas company obtains both lpg and the primary feedstock for its sng plant may have an adverse effect on the operations of the business 
the gas company manufactures sng and distributes sng and lpg 
sng feedstock or lpg supply disruptions or refinery shutdowns that limit the business ability to manufacture and or deliver gas to customers could increase costs as a result of an inability to source feedstock at acceptable rates 
the extended unavailability of one or both of the refineries or disruption to crude oil supplies or feedstock to hawaii could also result in an increased reliance on imported sources 
due to lack of jones act qualified vessels  the business is unable to purchase lpg from the mainland us an inability to purchase lpg from foreign sources would adversely affect operations 
the business is also limited in its ability to store lpg  and any disruption in supply may cause a depletion of lpg stocks 
currently  the business has only one contracted source of feedstock for sng  the tesoro refinery  and if tesoro chooses to discontinue the production or sale of feedstock to the business  which they could do with little notice  the gas company s utility business would suffer a significant disruption and potentially significant operating cost increases and or capital expenditures until alternative supplies of feedstock could be developed 
all supply disruptions of sng or lpg  if occurring for an extended period  could adversely impact the business contribution margin and cash flows 
in january  chevron announced that it plans to reduce the size of its global oil refining business  although it has not made any decisions regarding its refinery in hawaii 
chevron could decide to continue operating in hawaii  cease operations entirely or convert a portion of its operations into a terminal for importation of energy products 
chevron s hawaii refinery supplies the gas company with over half of its total lpg purchases 
any decision by chevron regarding its operations in hawaii could affect the business cost of lpg and may adversely impact its non utility contribution margin and profitability 
the most significant costs for the gas company are locally sourced lpg  lpg imports and feedstock for the sng plant  the costs of which are directly related to petroleum prices 
to the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers  the business contribution margin and cash flows will be adversely affected 
the profitability of the gas company is based on the margin of sales prices over costs 
since lpg and feedstock for the sng plant are commodities  changes in global supply of and demand for these products can have a significant impact on costs 
in addition  increased reliance on higher priced foreign sources of lpg  whether as a result of disruptions to or shortages in local sources or otherwise  could also have a significant impact on costs 
the gas company has no control over these costs  and  to the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers  the business financial condition and the results of operations would be adversely affected 
higher prices could result in reduced customer demand or customer conversion to alternative energy sources  or both  that would reduce the volume of gas sold and adversely affect the profitability of the gas company 
the gas company relies on its sng plant  including its transmission pipeline  for a significant portion of its sales 
disruptions at that facility could adversely affect the business ability to serve customers 
disruptions at the sng plant resulting from mechanical or operational problems or power failures could affect the ability of the gas company to produce sng 
most of the utility sales on oahu are of sng and all sng is produced at the oahu plant 
disruptions to the primary and redundant production systems would have a significant adverse effect on the gas company s sales and cash flows 
the operations of the gas company are subject to a variety of competitive pressures and the actions of competitors  particularly those involved in other energy sources  could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
other fuel sources such as electricity  diesel  solar energy  geo thermal  wind  other gas providers and alternative energy sources may be substituted for certain gas end use applications  particularly if the price of gas increases relative to other fuel sources  whether due to higher commodity supply costs or otherwise 
customers could  for a number of reasons  including increased gas prices  lower costs of alternative energy or convenience  meet their energy needs through alternative sources 
this could have an adverse effect on the business revenue and cash flows 

table of contents the gas company s utility business is subject to regulation by the hawaii public utilities commission  or hpuc  and actions by the hpuc or changes to the regulatory environment may constrain the operation or profitability of the business 
if the business fails to comply with certain hpuc regulatory conditions  the profitability of the gas company could be adversely impacted 
the business agreed to regulatory conditions with the hpuc that address a variety of matters including a requirement that the gas company and hgc s ratio of consolidated debt to total capital does not exceed  and a requirement to maintain million in readily available cash resources at the gas company  hgc or mic 
the hpuc regulates all franchised or certificated public service companies operating in hawaii  prescribes rates  tariffs  charges and fees  determines the allowable rate of earnings in establishing rates  issues guidelines concerning the general management of franchised or certificated utility businesses  and acts on requests for the acquisition  sale  disposition or other exchange of utility properties  including mergers and consolidations 
any adverse decision by the hpuc concerning the level or method of determining utility rates  the items and amounts that may be included in the rate base  the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable  the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns  or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding  could have an adverse effect on the business 
the gas company s operations on the islands of hawaii  maui and kauai rely on lpg that is transported to those islands by jones act qualified barges from oahu and from non jones act vessels from foreign ports 
disruptions to service by those vessels could adversely affect the business results of operations 
the jones act requires that all goods transported by water between us ports be carried in us flag ships and that they meet certain other requirements 
the business has time charter agreements allowing the use of two barges that currently have a cargo capacity of approximately  gallons and  gallons of lpg each 
the barges used by the business are the only two jones act qualified barges available in the hawaiian islands capable of carrying large volumes of lpg 
they are near the end of their useful economic lives  and the barge owner intends to refurbish one or both of them in the near future 
if the barges are unable to transport lpg from oahu and the business is not able to secure foreign source lpg or obtain an exemption to the jones act  the profitability of the business could be adversely impacted 
the gas company is subject to risks associated with volatility in the hawaii economy 
tourism and government activities including the military are two of the largest components of hawaii s economy 
hawaii s economy is heavily influenced by economic conditions in the us and asia and their impact on tourism  as well as by government spending 
as a result of the economic downturn  hawaii has experienced significant declines in levels of tourism which have affected the local economy generally 
a large portion of the gas company s sales are generated by businesses that rely on tourism 
if the local economy fails to improve or declines  the volume of gas sold could be negatively affected by business closures and or lower usage and adversely impact the business financial performance 
additionally  a lack of growth in the hawaii economy could reduce the level of new residential construction  and adversely impact growth in volume from new residential customers 
a reduction in government activity  particularly military activity  or a shift by either away from the use of gas products  could also have a negative impact on the gas company s results 
because of its geographic location  hawaii  and in turn the gas company  is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks that could materially disrupt operations 
hawaii is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks  such as hurricanes  floods  heavy and sustained rains and tidal waves 
because the business sng plant  sng transmission line and several storage facilities are close to the ocean  weather related disruptions to operations are possible 
in addition  earthquakes may cause disruptions 
these events could damage the business assets or could result in wide spread damage to its customers  thereby reducing sales volumes and  to the extent such damages are not covered by insurance  the business revenue and cash flows 

table of contents risks related to district energy pursuant to the terms of a use agreement with the city of chicago  the city of chicago has rights that  if exercised  could have a significant negative impact on district energy 
in order to operate the district cooling system in downtown chicago  the business has obtained the right to use certain public ways of the city of chicago under a use agreement  which we refer to as the use agreement 
under the terms of the use agreement  the city of chicago retains the right to use the public ways for a public purpose and has the right in the interest of public safety or convenience to cause the business to remove  modify  replace or relocate its facilities at the expense of the business 
if the city of chicago exercises these rights  district energy could incur significant costs and its ability to provide service to its customers could be disrupted  which would have an adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the use agreement is non exclusive  and the city of chicago is entitled to enter into use agreements with the business potential competitors 
the use agreement expires on december  and may be terminated by the city of chicago for any uncured material breach of its terms and conditions 
the city of chicago also may require district energy to pay liquidated damages of  a day if the business fails to remove  modify  replace or relocate its facilities when required to do so  if it installs any facilities that are not properly authorized under the use agreement or if the district cooling system does not conform to the city of chicago s standards 
each of these non compliance penalties could result in substantial financial loss or effectively shut down the district cooling system in downtown chicago 
any proposed renewal  extension or modification of the use agreement requires approval by the city council of chicago 
extensions and modifications subject to the city of chicago s approval include those to enable the expansion of chilling capacity and the connection of new customers to the district cooling system 
the city of chicago s approval is contingent upon the timely filing of an economic disclosure statement  or eds  by us and certain of the beneficial owners of our stock 
if any of these investors fails to file a completed eds form within days of the city of chicago s request or files an incomplete or inaccurate eds  the city of chicago has the right to refuse to provide the necessary approval for any extension or modification of the use agreement or to rescind the use agreement altogether 
if the city of chicago declines to approve extensions or modifications to the use agreement  district energy may not be able to increase the capacity of its district cooling system and pursue its growth strategy 
furthermore  if the city of chicago rescinds or voids the use agreement  the district cooling system in downtown chicago would be effectively shut down and the business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected as a result 
certain number of our investors may be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements of the city of chicago and non compliance may result in the city of chicago s rescission or voidance of the use agreement and any other arrangements district energy may have with the city of chicago at the time of the non compliance 
in order to secure any amendment to the use agreement with the city of chicago to pursue expansion plans or otherwise  or to enter into other contracts with the city of chicago  the city of chicago may require any person who owns or acquires or more of our llc interests to make a number of representations to the city of chicago by filing a completed eds 
our llc agreement requires that in the event that we need to obtain approval from the city of chicago in the future for any specific matter  including to expand the district cooling system or to amend the use agreement  we and each of our then investors would need to submit an eds to the city of chicago within days of the city of chicago s request 
in addition  our llc agreement requires each investor to provide any supplemental information needed to update any eds filed with the city of chicago as required by the city of chicago and as requested by us from time to time 
any eds filed by an investor may become publicly available 
by completing and signing an eds  an investor will have waived and released any possible rights or claims which it may have against the city of chicago in connection with the public release of information contained in the eds and also will have authorized the city of chicago to verify the accuracy of information submitted in the eds 
the requirements and consequences of filing an eds with the city of chicago will make compliance with the eds requirements difficult for our investors 

table of contents if any investor fails to comply with the eds requirements on time or the city of chicago determines that any information provided in any eds is false  incomplete or inaccurate  the city of chicago may rescind or void the use agreement or any other arrangements thermal chicago has with the city of chicago  and pursue any other remedies available to them 
if the city of chicago rescinds or voids the use agreement  the business district cooling system in downtown chicago would be effectively shut down and the business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected as a result 
if certain events within or beyond the control of district energy occur  district energy may be unable to perform its contractual obligations to provide chilling and heating services to its customers 
if  as a result  its customers elect to terminate their contracts  district energy may suffer loss of revenue 
in addition  district energy may be required to make payments to such customers for damages 
in the event of a shutdown of one or more of district energy s plants due to operational breakdown  strikes  the inability to retain or replace key technical personnel or events outside its control  such as an electricity blackout  or unprecedented weather conditions in chicago  district energy may be unable to continue to provide chilling and heating services to all of its customers 
as a result  district energy may be in breach of the terms of some or all of its customer contracts 
in the event that such customers elect to terminate their contracts with district energy as a consequence of their loss of service  its revenue may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  under a number of contracts  district energy may be required to pay damages to a customer in the event that a cessation of service results in loss to that customer 
northwind aladdin currently derives a majority of its operating cash flows from a contract with a single customer  the planet hollywood resort and casino  which emerged from bankruptcy several years ago 
if this customer were to enter into bankruptcy again  northwind s aladdin s contract may be amended or terminated and the business may receive no compensation  which could result in the loss of our investment in northwind aladdin 
northwind aladdin derives a majority of its cash flows from a contract with the planet hollywood resort and casino formerly known as the aladdin resort and casino in las vegas to supply cold and hot water and back up electricity 
the aladdin resort and casino emerged from bankruptcy immediately prior to district energy s acquisition of northwind aladdin in september  and  during the course of those proceedings  the contract with northwind aladdin was amended to reduce the payment obligations of the aladdin resort and casino 
if the planet hollywood resort and casino were to enter into bankruptcy again and a cheaper source of the services that northwind aladdin provides can be found  this contract may be terminated or amended 
this could result in a total loss or significant reduction in district energy s income from northwind aladdin  for which the business may receive no compensation 
risks related to atlantic aviation further deterioration of business jet traffic at airports where atlantic aviation operates would cause atlantic aviation to default on its debt obligations 
atlantic aviation s current debt to ebitda ratio as defined under its loan agreement is x 
this compares to a maximum permitted debt to ebitda ratio of x 
the maximum permitted debt to ebitda ratio drops to x from march  a further decline in business jet take offs and landings at airports where atlantic aviation operates fbos could result in a reduction of atlantic aviation s ebitda as defined under its loan agreement 
consequently  atlantic aviation could exceed the maximum permitted debt to ebitda ratio under its loan agreement and default on its debt obligations 
if the default remains uncured  the lenders under the loan agreement may accelerate the repayment of the outstanding balance of the borrowings under the agreement 
if atlantic aviation is unable to repay or refinance this debt  it may be rendered insolvent 
a default on the debt obligations leading to bankruptcy or insolvency would cause atlantic aviation to default on its fbo leases and would allow the local airport authorities to terminate the leases 
further deterioration in the economy in general or in the aviation industry that results in less air traffic at airports that atlantic aviation services would have a material adverse impact on our business 
a large part of the business revenue is derived from fuel sales and other services provided to general aviation customers and  to a lesser extent  commercial air travelers 
a further economic downturn could reduce 
table of contents the level of air travel  adversely affecting atlantic aviation 
general aviation travel is primarily a function of economic activity 
consequently  during periods of economic downturn  fbo customers are more likely to curtail air travel 
the economic downturn of and had a significant impact on the activity levels of many fbo customers  which resulted in significant declines in the gross profit of this business 
if the economy does not continue to improve or negative sentiment regarding corporate jet usage persists or increases  we may see future declines in volumes of fuel sold  which could materially adversely affect the results of this business and which could cause it to fail to meet the financial covenants of its debt arrangements and allow its lenders to declare its entire indebtedness immediately due and payable 
air travel and air traffic volume can also be affected by events that have nationwide and industry wide implications  such as the events of september   as well as local circumstances 
events such as wars  outbreaks of disease such as sars  and terrorist activities in the united states or overseas may reduce air travel 
local circumstances include downturns in the general economic conditions of the area where an airport is located or other situations in which our major fbo customers relocate their home base or preferred fueling stop to alternative locations 
in addition  changes to regulations governing the tax treatment relating to general aviation travel  either for businesses or individuals may cause a reduction in general aviation travel 
increased environmental regulation restricting or increasing the cost of aviation activities could also cause the business revenue to decline 
current economic conditions and increased pricing competition at atlantic aviation may have an adverse effect on market share and fuel margins  causing a decline in the profitability of that business 
some of atlantic aviation s competitors are pursuing more aggressive pricing strategies 
these competitors operate fbos at a number of airports where atlantic aviation operates or at airports near where it operates 
this competition  combined with the continuation or worsening of current economic conditions  has in recent periods and may continue to result in increased focus on cost among customers and  consequently  a decline in corporate jet usage and increased price sensitivity 
these factors may cause volumes of fuel sales and market share to decline and may result in increased margin pressure  adversely affecting the profitability of this business 
atlantic aviation is subject to a variety of competitive pressures  and the actions of competitors may have a material adverse effect on its revenue 
fbo operators at a particular airport compete based on a number of factors  including location of the facility relative to runways and street access  service  value added features  reliability and price 
many of atlantic aviation s fbos compete with one or more fbos at their respective airports  and  to a lesser extent  with fbos at nearby airports 
furthermore  leases related to fbo operations may be subject to competitive bidding at the end of their term 
some present and potential competitors have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than atlantic aviation  which may negatively impact atlantic s aviation ability to compete at each airport or for lease renewal 
atlantic aviation s fbos do not have the right to be the sole provider of fbo services at any of its fbo locations 
the authority responsible for each airport has the ability to grant other fbo leases at the airport and new competitors could be established at those fbo locations 
the addition of new competitors may reduce  or impair atlantic aviation s ability to increase  the revenue of the fbo business 
the termination for cause or convenience of one or more of the fbo leases would damage atlantic aviation s operations significantly 
atlantic aviation s revenue is derived from long term leases at airports and one heliport 
if atlantic aviation defaults on the terms and conditions of its leases  including upon insolvency  the relevant authority may terminate the lease without compensation 
additionally  leases at chicago midway  philadelphia  north east philadelphia  new orleans international and orange county airports and the metroport th street heliport in new york city  representing approximately of atlantic aviation s gross profit in  allow 
table of contents the relevant authority to terminate the lease at their convenience 
in each case  atlantic aviation would then lose the income from that location and potentially the expected returns from prior capital expenditures 
atlantic aviation would also likely be in default under the loan agreements and be obliged to repay its lenders a portion or the entire outstanding loan amount 
the transportation security administration  or tsa  is considering new regulations which could impair the relative convenience of general aviation and adversely affect demand for atlantic aviation s services 
the tsa has proposed new regulations known as the large aircraft security program lasp  which would require all us operators of general aviation aircraft exceeding  pounds maximum take off weight to implement security programs that are subject to tsa audit 
in addition  the proposed regulations would require airports servicing these aircraft to implement security programs involving additional security measures  including passenger and baggage screening 
we believe these new regulations  if implemented  will affect many of atlantic aviation s customers and all of the airports at which it operates 
these rules  if adopted  could decrease the convenience and attractiveness of general aviation travel relative to commercial air travel and  therefore  may adversely impact demand for atlantic aviation s services 
risk related to pcaa the creditors of pcaa may seek recourse to the company regardless of the legal merits 
pcaa is in the process of completing a sale of its assets through a chapter bankruptcy 
creditors of the business may also attempt to seek recovery from the company and  through the company  seek recourse to the assets of our other businesses  regardless of the merits of such a claim or lack thereof  which could result in substantial legal costs and significant disruption of management time and resources  thereby adversely affecting our profitability 
risks related to ownership of our stock our manager s affiliation with macquarie group limited and the macquarie group may result in conflicts of interest or a decline in our stock price 
our manager is an affiliate of macquarie group limited and a member of the macquarie group 
from time to time  we have entered into  and in the future we may enter into  transactions and relationships involving macquarie group limited  its affiliates  or other members of the macquarie group 
such transactions have included and may include  among other things  the entry into debt facilities and derivative instruments with members of the macquarie group serving as lender or counterparty  and financial advisory services provided to us by the macquarie group 
although our audit committee  all of the members of which are independent directors  is required to approve of any related party transactions  including those involving members of the macquarie group or its affiliates  the relationship of our manager to the macquarie group may result in conflicts of interest 
in addition  as a result of our manager s being a member of the macquarie group  negative market perceptions of macquarie group limited generally or of macquarie s infrastructure management model  or macquarie group statements or actions with respect to other managed vehicles  may affect market perceptions of our company and cause a decline in the price of our llc interests unrelated to our financial performance and prospects 
our manager can resign with days notice and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time  resulting in a disruption in our operations which could adversely affect our financial results and negatively impact the market price of our llc interests 
our manager has the right  under the management services agreement  to resign at any time with days notice  whether we have found a replacement or not 
the resignation of our manager will trigger mandatory repayment obligations under debt facilities at all of our operating companies other than imtt 
if our manager resigns  we may not be able to find a new external manager or hire internal management with similar expertise within days to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are 
table of contents unable to do so quickly  our operations are likely to experience a disruption  our financial results could be adversely affected  perhaps materially  and the market price of our llc interests may decline substantially 
in addition  the coordination of our internal management  acquisition activities and supervision of our businesses and investments are likely to suffer if we were unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our manager and its affiliates 
furthermore  if our manager resigns  the company and its subsidiaries will be required to cease use of the macquarie brand entirely  and change their names to remove any reference to macquarie 
this may cause the value of the company and the market price of our llc interests to decline 
in the event of the underperformance of our manager  we may be unable to remove our manager  which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our llc interests 
under the terms of the management services agreement  our manager must significantly underperform in order for the management services agreement to be terminated 
the company s board of directors cannot remove our manager unless our llc interests underperform a weighted average of two benchmark indices by more than in relative terms and more than in absolute terms in out of consecutive quarters prior to and including the most recent full quarter  and the holders of a minimum of of the outstanding llc interests excluding any llc interests owned by our manager or any affiliate of the manager vote to remove our manager  our manager materially breaches the terms of the management services agreement and such breach continues unremedied for days after notice  our manager acts with gross negligence  willful misconduct  bad faith or reckless disregard of its duties in carrying out its obligations under the management services agreement  or engages in fraudulent or dishonest acts  or our manager experiences certain bankruptcy events 
because our manager s performance is measured by the market performance of our llc interests relative to a weighted average of two benchmark indices  even if the absolute market performance of our llc interests does not meet expectations  the company s board of directors cannot remove our manager unless the market performance of our llc interests also significantly underperforms the weighted average of the benchmark indices 
if we were unable to remove our manager in circumstances where the absolute market performance of our llc interests does not meet expectations  the market price of our llc interests could be negatively affected 
certain provisions of the management services agreement and the operating agreement of the company make it difficult for third parties to acquire control of the company and could deprive you of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for your llc interests 
in addition to the limited circumstances in which our manager can be terminated under the terms of the management services agreement  the management services agreement provides that in circumstances where the stock ceases to be listed on a recognized us exchange as a result of the acquisition of stock by third parties in an amount that results in the stock ceasing to meet the distribution and trading criteria on such exchange or market  the manager has the option to either propose an alternate fee structure and remain our manager or resign  terminate the management services agreement upon days written notice and be paid a substantial termination fee 
the termination fee payable on the manager s exercise of its right to resign as our manager subsequent to a delisting of our llc interests could delay or prevent a change in control that may favor our shareholders 
furthermore  in the event of such a delisting  any proceeds from the sale  lease or exchange of a significant amount of assets must be reinvested in new assets of our company  subject to debt repayment obligations 
we would also be prohibited from incurring any new indebtedness or engaging in any transactions with shareholders of the company or its affiliates without the prior written approval of the manager 
these provisions could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium on the llc interests owned by them 

table of contents the operating agreement of the company  which we refer to as the llc agreement  contains a number of provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discouraging a third party from acquiring  control of the company 
these provisions include restrictions on the company s ability to enter into certain transactions with our major shareholders  with the exception of our manager  modeled on the limitation contained in section of the delaware general corporation law  allowing only the company s board of directors to fill vacancies  including newly created directorships and requiring that directors may be removed only for cause and by a shareholder vote of  requiring that only the company s chairman or board of directors may call a special meeting of our shareholders  prohibiting shareholders from taking any action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the company s board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our shareholders at a shareholders meeting  having a substantial number of additional llc interests authorized but unissued  providing the company s board of directors with broad authority to amend the llc agreement  and requiring that any person who is the beneficial owner of or more of our llc interests make a number of representations to the city of chicago in its standard form of eds  the current form of which is included in our llc agreement  which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report 
the market price and marketability of our llc interests may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings 
the market price of our llc interests may fluctuate significantly 
many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our llc interests and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings 
these factors include the following price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets generally  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of macquarie group limited and or vehicles managed by the macquarie group or branded under the macquarie name or logo  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies  business development companies or companies in our sectors  which may not be related to the operating performance of these companies  changes in our earnings or variations in operating results  any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by securities analysts  changes in regulatory policies or tax law  operating performance of companies comparable to us  and loss of funding sources

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere herein 
general we own  operate and invest in a diversified group of infrastructure businesses that provide basic services  such as chilled water for building cooling and gas utility services to businesses and individuals primarily in the us the businesses we own and operate are energy related businesses consisting of imtt  the gas company  and our controlling interest in district energy  and an aviation related business consisting of atlantic aviation 
on january   we agreed to sell the assets of pcaa through a bankruptcy process  which we expect to complete in the first half of this business is now a discontinued operation and is therefore separately reported in our consolidated financial statements and is no longer a reportable segment 
our infrastructure businesses generally operate in sectors with limited competition and barriers to entry resulting from a variety of factors including high initial development and construction costs  the existence of long term contracts or the requirement to obtain government approvals and a lack of immediate cost efficient alternatives to the services provided 
overall they tend to generate sustainable and growing long term cash flows 
our energy related businesses have proven  to date  largely resistant to the economic downturn of the past to months  primarily due to the contracted or utility like nature of their revenues combined with the essential services they provide and the contractual or regulatory ability to pass through most cost increases to customers 
we believe these businesses are generally able to generate consistent cash flows throughout the business cycle 
the results of atlantic aviation have been negatively affected since mid by lower overall economic and declining general aviation activity levels through mid however  general activity levels stabilized in the second half of and finally showed some year on year growth in december 
this stabilization  combined with expense reduction efforts  resulted in an improving outlook for the business 
the uncertainty and instability in the credit markets appears to be subsiding 
this is evident in the increase in the volume of lending activity and the price at which such lending is occurring compared with levels during the height of the global financial crisis 
we believe that this improvement in the credit market has had a beneficial impact on the outlook for our businesses  given the significant amount of long term debt those businesses have outstanding 
despite the improvement in the credit markets  we expect to continue to strengthen our consolidated balance sheet and those of our operating entities through prudent reduction in the amount of long term debt outstanding  further increasing the likelihood that we will be able to successfully refinance this debt as it matures over approximately the next four years 
in  we accomplished a portion of this objective by repaying in full our holding company debt and by reaching an agreement to sell the assets of pcaa  as discussed below 
to the extent that our businesses generate excess cash  we expect to retain such cash over the near term 
pcaa asset purchase agreement on january   we announced that pcaa had entered into an asset purchase agreement with bainbridge zks corinthian holdings  llc 
this agreement  which is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court  will result in the sale of the assets of pcaa for million  subject to certain adjustments and will result in the elimination of million of current debt from liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet 
the cancelled debt in excess of the sale proceeds used to repay such debt would result in cancellation of debt income and the proceeds in excess of the business net assets as a gain on sale 
as a part of the bankruptcy sale process  all cash proceeds would be court 
if approved  we expect to complete the sale of the assets in the first half of 
table of contents as part of the bankruptcy filing  we have no obligation to and have no intention of committing additional capital to this business and our ongoing liabilities are expected to be no more than million in guarantees of a single parking facility lease 
creditors of this business do not have recourse to any assets of our holding company or any assets of our other businesses  other than approximately million in a lease guarantee as of february  sale of non controlling stake in district energy on december   we sold of the non controlling interest of district energy to john hancock life insurance company and john hancock life insurance company usa collectively john hancock for million 
the proceeds of the sale  along with other cash resources  were used to fully repay the million balance on our holding company revolving credit facility as described below 
mic inc revolving credit facility at march   we reclassified the outstanding balance drawn on the revolving credit facility at our non operating holding company from long term debt to current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet due to its scheduled maturity on march  during the year  we were in discussions with our lenders to convert the facility to a term loan and extend the maturity date of the million outstanding balance 
by december  we had received unanimous approval from the lenders to extend the term of the facility 
however  using the net cash proceeds we received from the sale of the non controlling interest in district energy  and cash on hand  we paid off the outstanding principal balance on december  and avoided the substantial costs that would have been incurred had the terms of the facility been amended 
shortly thereafter we elected to reduce the amount available on the revolving credit facility from million to million through to the maturity of the facility at march  income taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return that includes the taxable income of all our businesses  except imtt and  going forward  district energy 
imtt and district energy will file separate income tax returns and we will include in our taxable income the taxable portion of any distributions from those businesses  which taxable distributions should qualify for the dividends received deduction 
operating segments and businesses energy related businesses imtt imtt provides bulk liquid storage and handling services in north america through ten terminals located on the east  west and gulf coasts  the great lakes region of the united states and partially owned terminals in quebec and newfoundland  canada 
imtt has its largest terminals in the strategic locations of new york harbor and the lower mississippi river near new orleans 
imtt stores and handles petroleum products  various chemicals  renewable fuels  and vegetable and animal oils and  based on storage capacity  operates one of the largest bulk liquid storage terminal businesses in the united states 
the key drivers of imtt s revenue and gross profit include the amount of tank capacity rented to customers and the rental rates 
customers generally rent tanks under contracts with terms between three and five years that require payment regardless of actual tank usage 
demand for storage capacity within a particular region eg new york harbor serves as the key driver of storage capacity utilization and tank rental rates 
this demand for capacity reflects both the level of consumption of the bulk liquid products stored by the terminals as well as import and export activity of such products 
we believe major constraints on increases in the supply of new bulk liquid storage capacity in imtt s key markets have been and will continue to be limited availability of waterfront land with access to the infrastructure necessary for land based receipt and distribution of stored product road  rail and pipelines  lengthy environmental permitting processes and high capital costs 
we believe a favorable supply demand balance for bulk liquid storage currently exists 
table of contents energy related businesses imtt continued in the markets serviced by imtt s major facilities 
this condition  when combined with the attributes of imtt s facilities such as deep water drafts and access to land based infrastructure  have allowed imtt to increase prices while maintaining very high storage capacity utilization rates 
imtt earns revenue at its terminals from a number of sources including storage charges for bulk liquids per barrel  per month rental  throughput of liquids handling charges  heating a pass through of the cost associated with heating liquids to prevent excessive viscosity and other revenue from blending  packaging and warehousing  etc most customer contracts include provisions for annual price increases based on inflation 
in operating its terminals  imtt incurs labor costs  fuel costs  repair and maintenance costs  real and personal property taxes and other costs which include insurance and other operating costs such as utilities and inventory used in packaging and drumming activities 
in  imtt generated approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its bayonne facility  which services new york harbor  and approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its st 
rose  gretna  avondale and geismar facilities  which together service the lower mississippi river region with st 
rose being the largest contributor 
two key factors will likely have a material impact on imtt s total terminal revenue and terminal gross profit in the future 
first  imtt has achieved substantial increases in storage rates at its bayonne and louisiana facilities over the past few years 
based on the current level of demand for bulk liquid storage in new york harbor and the lower mississippi river  we anticipate that imtt will achieve annual increases in average storage rates in excess of inflation at least through second  imtt has invested in significant growth capital expenditures over the past year that we expect should contribute to terminal gross profit after the shareholders agreement between us  imtt holdings and its other shareholders specifies a default distribution policy for imtt 
although the default under the shareholders agreement is to distribute excess cash  shareholders have indicated that they are prepared to reinvest excess cash generated during in new growth opportunities rather than pay distributions 
our interest in imtt holdings  from the date of closing our acquisition  may   is reflected in our equity in earnings and amortization charges of investee line in our consolidated statements of operations 
cash distributions received by us in excess of our equity in imtt s earnings and amortization charges are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows from investing activities under return on investment in unconsolidated business

because both sng and lpg are derived from crude oil  revenue levels  without volume changes  will generally track global oil prices 
utility revenue includes fuel adjustment charges through which the changes in feedstock costs are passed through to customers 
evaluating the performance of this business based on contribution margin removes the volatility associated with fluctuations in the price of feedstock 
prices charged by the gas company to its customers for the utility gas business are based on hpuc utility rates that allow the business the opportunity to recover its costs of providing utility gas service  including operating expenses and taxes  and capital investments through recovery of depreciation and a return on the capital invested 
the gas company s rate structure generally allows it to maintain a relatively consistent dollar based margin per thermal unit by passing increases or decreases in fuel costs through to customers via fuel adjustment charges without filing a general rate case 
the rates that are charged to non utility customers are based on the cost of lpg plus delivery costs  and on the cost of alternative fuels and competitive factors 
the gas company incurs expenses in operating and maintaining its facilities and distribution network  comprising a sng plant  a mile transmission line  miles of distribution and service pipelines  several tank storage facilities and a fleet of vehicles 
these costs are generally fixed in nature 
other operating expenses incurred  such as for lpg  feedstock for the sng plant and revenue based taxes  generally fluctuate with the volume of product sold 
in addition  the business incurs general and administrative expenses at its executive office that include expenses for senior management  accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance  regulatory compliance  employee benefits  rents  utilities  insurance and other normal business costs 
district energy district energy consists of thermal chicago and northwind aladdin  which are and indirectly owned by us 
thermal chicago sells chilled water under long term contracts to approximately customers in downtown chicago and one customer outside of the downtown area 
under the long term contracts  thermal chicago receives both capacity and consumption payments 
capacity payments cooling capacity revenue are received regardless of the volume of chilled water used by a customer and these payments generally increase in line with inflation 
consumption payments cooling consumption revenue are per unit charges for the volume of chilled water used 
such payments are higher in the second and third quarters of each year when the demand for building cooling is at its highest 
consumption payments also fluctuate moderately from year to year depending on weather conditions 
by contract  consumption payments generally increase in line with a number of indices that reflect the cost of electricity  labor and other input costs relevant to the operations of thermal chicago 
the weighting of the individual indices broadly reflects the composition of thermal chicago s direct expenses 

table of contents energy related businesses district energy continued thermal chicago s principal direct expense is electricity 
other direct expenses are labor  operations and maintenance and depreciation and accretion 
electricity usage fluctuates in line with the volume of chilled water produced 
thermal chicago focuses on minimizing the cost of electricity consumed per unit of chilled water produced by operating its plants to maximize efficient use of electricity 
other direct expenses are largely fixed regardless of the volumes of chilled water produced 
thermal chicago has entered into a contract with a retail energy supplier to provide the majority of the business electricity in at a fixed price 
electricity for one of the plants is purchased by the landlord customer and the cost is passed through to the business 
based on thermal chicago s retail contract  its electricity costs will increase by approximately over and the business will pass the increase through to its customers 
the business will need to enter into supply contracts for and subsequent years and prices will fluctuate based on underlying power costs 
northwind aladdin services customers a hotel casino complex and a shopping mall in las vegas  nevada 
under its customer contracts  northwind aladdin receives monthly fixed payments totaling approximately million per annum through march and monthly fixed payments totaling approximately million per year thereafter through february aviation related business atlantic aviation the performance of atlantic aviation depends upon the level of general aviation activity  and jet fuel consumption  for the largest portion of its gross profit 
general aviation activity is in turn a function of economic activity and demographic trends in the regions serviced by the airport at which the business operates and the general level of economic activity in the united states 
a number of these airports are located near key business centers such as new york  new york  chicago  illinois and philadelphia  pennsylvania as well as recreational destinations such as aspen  colorado and sun valley  idaho 
fuel gross profit is a function of the volume gallons sold and the average dollar margin per gallon 
the average price per gallon is based on our cost of fuel plus  where applicable  fees and taxes paid to airports or other local authorities cost of revenue fuel  plus atlantic aviation s margin 
dollar based margins per gallon have been relatively insensitive to the wholesale price of fuel with both increases and decreases in the wholesale price of fuel generally passed through to customers  subject to the level of price competition that exists at the various fbos 
the average dollar based margin varies based on business considerations and customer mix 
base tenants generally benefit from price discounts based on a higher utilization of atlantic aviation s networks 
transient customers typically pay a higher price 
atlantic aviation also earns revenue from activities other than fuel sales non fuel revenue 
for example  atlantic aviation earns revenue from refueling some general aviation customers on a pass through basis  where it acts as a fueling agent for fuel suppliers 
atlantic aviation receives a fee for this service  generally calculated on a per gallon basis 
in addition  the business earns revenue from aircraft parking and hangar rental fees and by providing general aviation customers with other services  such as de icing 
at some sites where atlantic aviation operates an fbo business  atlantic aviation also earns revenue from refueling and de icing some commercial airlines on a fee for service basis 
expenses associated with non fuel revenue cost of revenue non fuel include de icing fluid costs and payments to airport authorities which vary from site to site 
cost of revenue non fuel is directly related to the volume of services provided and therefore generally increases in line with non fuel revenue in dollar terms 
atlantic aviation incurs expenses in operating and maintaining each fbo 
operating expenses include rent and insurance  which are generally fixed in nature and other expenses  such as salaries  that generally increase with the level of activity 
in addition  atlantic aviation incurs general and administrative expenses at the head office that include senior management expenses as well as accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance and other corporate costs 

table of contents results of operations consolidated key factors affecting operating results strong performance in our energy related businesses reflecting increases in average storage rates and storage capacity at imtt  interim rate case increase in the utility sector and new business processes which improved our ability to acquire and price our non utility lpg at the non utility sector at the gas company  and an increase in contracted capacity as new customers began service at district energy 
operating results from atlantic aviation reflecting a year on year decline in fuel volumes  an increase in interest expense due to payments of interest rate swap breakage fees as a result of the debt amendment and the early repayment of the outstanding term loan debt  partially offset by cost reductions 
our consolidated results of operations are as follows in thousands

table of contents results of operations consolidated continued gross profit the decrease in our consolidated gross profit in was due to a decline in fuel volumes at atlantic aviation  partially offset by improved results at our consolidated energy related businesses 
the increase in our consolidated gross profit in was primarily due to acquisitions made by atlantic aviation in and the first quarter of  partially offset by a decline in performance at existing locations 
selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily a result of cost reduction efforts at atlantic aviation  partially offset by higher costs at the holding company mainly attributable to the sale of the non controlling stake in district energy and increased incentive compensation  pension expense and professional services at our consolidated energy related businesses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily a result of acquisitions made by atlantic aviation in and fees to manager base fees to our manager decreased in due to our lower market capitalization 
our manager elected to reinvest the second  third and fourth quarter of base management fees in additional llc interests 
llc interests for the second and third quarters of were issued to our manager during the second half of llc interests for the fourth quarter of will be issued to our manager during the first quarter of the fees payable to our manager in were lower primarily due to performance fees of million in that did not recur in our manager elected to reinvest these performance fees in additional llc interests 
base fees paid to our manager in also decreased due to our lower market capitalization 
goodwill impairment goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
based on the testing performed  we recognized goodwill impairment charges at atlantic aviation in the first six months of and the fourth quarter of depreciation depreciation includes non cash asset impairment charges of million and million recorded in and  respectively  at atlantic aviation 
excluding these impairment charges  depreciation expense increased each year as a result of capital expenditures by our businesses resulting in higher asset balances 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles expense includes non cash asset impairment charges of million  million and million recorded by atlantic aviation in  and  respectively 
excluding these impairment charges  amortization of intangibles expense increased in due to acquisitions made by atlantic aviation in and amortization of intangibles expense for decreased due to the impairments previously discussed reducing the balance of intangible assets being amortized 
interest expense interest expense at atlantic aviation increased in primarily due to payments of interest rate swap breakage fees 
this business expects to pay further interest rate swap breakage fees as it continues to pay down its term loan debt 
this increase was partially offset by the favorable libor movements on unhedged debt during the year  primarily from the mic inc revolving credit facility  which was repaid in december the increase in interest expense in was due to a higher average level of debt outstanding  resulting from additional debt drawn to fund acquisitions and refinancings in the second half of 
table of contents results of operations consolidated continued loss on extinguishment of debt we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of million in  related to refinancings at atlantic aviation and district energy 
this loss included a million make whole payment for district energy 
the remainder was a non cash write off of previously deferred financing costs 
equity in earnings losses and amortization charges of investees our equity in the earnings of imtt increased in due to higher operating results of the business for that period  together with our share of the non cash derivative gains of million compared with our share of non cash derivative losses of million in loss on derivative instruments we discontinued hedge accounting at atlantic aviation as of february  and april  for our other businesses 
in addition  in the first quarter of  the gas company  district energy and atlantic aviation each entered into libor based basis swaps 
these basis swaps have lowered the effective cash interest rate on these businesses debt through march for the year ended december   loss on derivative instruments represents the change in fair value of interest rate swaps from the dates that hedge accounting was discontinued 
in addition  loss on derivative instruments includes the reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings  as atlantic aviation pays down its debt more quickly than anticipated 
income taxes for the and years  we reported a consolidated net loss before income taxes  for which we recorded a deferred tax benefit  net of certain state net operating losses and a portion of our impairment attributable to non deductible goodwill 
for  we expect to have consolidated current federal taxable income of approximately million  which will be offset by a portion of our consolidated federal net operating loss nol carryforward 
our federal taxable income includes a taxable gain from the sale of the non controlling interest of district energy 
we expect to pay a  federal alternative minimum tax for we include dividends received from imtt in our consolidated income tax return 
of the million in distributions we received from that business in  we expect that all of those distributions will be treated as a return of capital for income tax purposes  and not included in current taxable income 
due to our nol carryforwards  we do not expect to have regular taxable income or pay regular federal income tax payments through at least the cash state and local taxes paid by our businesses is discussed below in the sections entitled income taxes for each of our individual businesses 
as discussed in note  income taxes in our consolidated financial statements  in part ii  item of this form k  we now evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets without taking into consideration the deferred tax liabilities of district energy 
we have concluded that the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities will more likely than not result in the realization of all our federal deferred tax assets  except for approximately million 
accordingly  we have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for this amount 
of this valuation allowance  million is recorded on the books of pcaa  which is reported in our discontinued operations 
in calculating our consolidated state income tax provision  we have provided a valuation allowance for certain state income tax net operating loss carryforwards  the utilization of which is not assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
in addition  we expect to incur certain expenses that will not be deductible in determining state taxable income 
accordingly  these expenses have also been excluded in determining our state income tax expense 
further  approximately million of the write down of intangibles is attributable to goodwill and is a permanent book tax difference  for which no tax benefit has been recognized 

table of contents results of operations consolidated continued discontinued operations on january   we agreed to sell the assets of pcaa through a bankruptcy process  which we expect to complete in the first half of this results of this business have been reported as a discontinued operation and prior comparable periods have been re stated to conform to the current period presentation 
see note  discontinued operations  in our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for financial information and further discussions 
corporate allocation and other intercompany fees charged to pcaa have been reported in earnings from discontinued operations in our consolidated continuing results of operations 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda excluding non cash items and free cash flow in accordance with gaap  we have disclosed ebitda excluding non cash items for our company and each of our operating segments in note  reportable segments  in our consolidated financial statements  as a key performance metric relied on by management in evaluating our performance 
ebitda excluding non cash items is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash items  which includes impairments  derivative gains and losses and adjustments for other non cash items reflected in the statements of operations 
we believe ebitda excluding non cash items provides additional insight into the performance of our operating businesses relative to each other and similar businesses without regard to their capital structure  and their ability to service or reduce debt  fund capital expenditures and or support distributions to the holding company 
effective this reporting period  we are also disclosing free cash flow  as defined by us  as a means of assessing the amount of cash generated by our businesses and supplementing other information provided in accordance with gaap 
we believe that reporting free cash flow will provide our investors with additional insight into our future ability to deploy cash  as gaap metrics such as net income and cash from operating activities do not reflect all of the items that our management considers in estimating the amount of cash generated by our operating entities 
in this annual report on form k  we have disclosed free cash flow for our consolidated results and for each of our operating segments 
we define free cash flow as cash from operating activities  less maintenance capital expenditures and changes in working capital 
working capital movements are excluded on the basis that these are largely timing differences in payables and receivables  and are therefore not reflective of our ability to generate cash 
we note that free cash flow does not fully reflect our ability to freely deploy generated cash  as it does not reflect required payments to be made on our indebtedness  pay dividends and other fixed obligations or the other cash items excluded when calculating free cash flow 
we also note that free cash flow may be calculated in a different manner by other companies  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
therefore  our free cash flow should be used as a supplemental measure and not in lieu of our financial results reported under gaap 
in and  we disclosed ebitda only 
the following tables  reflecting results of operations for the consolidated group and for our businesses for the years ended december  and  have been conformed to current periods presentation reflecting ebitda excluding non cash items and free cash flow

corporate allocation expense  other intercompany fees and the federal tax effect have been excluded from the above table as they are eliminated on consolidation at the mic inc level 

table of contents energy related businesses the gas company continued although the presentation and analysis of contribution margin is a non gaap performance measure  management believes that it is meaningful to understanding the business performance under both a utility rate structure and a non utility competitive pricing structure 
under a utility environment  feedstock costs are automatically passed through to utility customers  while non utility pricing may be adjusted  subject to the competitive environment  to recover changes in raw material costs 
contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to revenue  operating income  or net income  determined in accordance with us gaap 
the business calculates contribution margin as revenue less direct costs of revenue other than production and transmission and distribution costs 
other companies may calculate contribution margin differently or may use different metrics and  therefore  the contribution margin presented for the gas company is not necessarily comparable with metrics of other companies 
contribution margin and operating income utility contribution margin was higher  primarily due to implementation of the interim rate increase from june   partially offset by volume declines related almost entirely to commercial customers  who are more exposed to the variability of the economic cycle 
sales volume in was approximately lower than non utility contribution margin was higher  primarily due to lower input costs  partially offset by a volume decline from local suppliers reduced their production of propane 
to the extent that local suppliers are unable to supply the gas company with a sufficient amount of propane  the business believes it can supplement its supply from foreign sources 
foreign sourced propane is likely to cost more than locally produced propane  although a portion of any increased cost may be offset by improved efficiency in distribution 
selling  general and administrative costs increased due to an approximate  increase in pension expense  higher incentive compensation based upon strong performance  and professional service costs primarily related to the implementation of a profit center structure in income taxes income from the gas company is included in our consolidated federal income tax return  and its income is subject to hawaii state income taxes 
the tax expense in the table above includes both state taxes and the portion of the consolidated federal tax liability attributable to the business 
the business federal taxable income differs from book income primarily as a result of differences in the depreciation of fixed assets 
net book income before taxes includes depreciation based on asset values and lives that differ from those used in determining taxable income 
for  the business expects to have a current state income tax liability of approximately  year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results decreased utility contribution margin due principally to lower volume of gas sold  and increased non utility contribution margin primarily due to price increases during  partially offset by higher cost of fuel and increased costs to deliver lpg to oahu s neighboring islands

the volume of gas products sold in was approximately lower than 
table of contents energy related businesses the gas company continued production costs increased primarily due to higher electricity  material and personnel costs 
transmission and distribution costs were lower due principally to lower costs related to the completion of the government required pipeline inspection  and lower adjustment to reserves for asset retirement costs  partially offset by higher personnel and rent costs 
selling  general and administrative costs were higher due to an increase in bad debt expense reserves  higher personnel costs  including overtime and fewer vacancies  higher employee benefit costs  including pension expense  and higher professional services costs

gross profit gross profit was relatively flat primarily due to annual inflation related increases of contract capacity rates in accordance with customer contract terms offset by lower cooling consumption revenue and overall electricity costs due to lower ton hour sales resulting from cooler than average temperatures in compared with other revenue increased due to the business pass through to customers of the higher cost of natural gas consumables  which is offset in other direct expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the timing of audit fees in and the collection in of amounts which were previously written off in relation to a customer bankruptcy filed in interest expense  net interest expense increased as a result of higher debt levels associated with the refinancing and higher non cash amortization of deferred financing costs 

table of contents energy related businesses district energy continued loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt comprised a million make whole payment and a million deferred financing costs write off associated with the refinance of the business senior notes in  which did not recur in aviation related business atlantic aviation the rapidly changing conditions affecting this business warrants a discussion of current and comparable prior period performance as well as a quarter on quarter sequential analysis in order to facilitate an understanding of the stabilization of the general aviation market in recent months and its effect on the business financial results 
the soft economic conditions caused a lower utilization of business jets by both corporations and individuals 
this lower utilization was exacerbated by the negative publicity of the general aviation sector 
according to flight data reported by the faa  the level of us business jet flight activity as measured by take offs and landings declined in quarterly activity level has increased sequentially since the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  business jet take offs and landings were flat year on year but increased sequentially versus the third quarter of despite the typical seasonal business jet traffic slowdown in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter 
the leverage covenant for atlantic aviation steps down on march  from x to x trailing twelve month ebidta  as defined by the terms of the debt facility 
given the performance of the business of the last three quarters of  the business needs to achieve an ebitda of approximately million to remain covenant compliant in the first quarter of in the first quarter of  ebitda was million 
since that time  take offs and landings have sequentially improved by and we have reduced our costs by 
the fourth quarter ebitda was million 
accordingly  we remain confident of being covenant compliant when the covenant steps down on march  unless there is some external shock to the industry or sudden decline in general aviation activity 
after march   the covenant then steps down every subsequent march until and including march volatility in the general aviation sector in the last months makes it difficult to project future take off and landings with any degree of confidence 
however  given the recent business jet traffic trajectory  and assuming no external shock to the industry  we believe that cash generation from the business will be sufficient to meet debt service obligations and the business will remain in compliance with financial covenants through the maturity of the business debt without any further equity contribution from mic 
additionally  we anticipate further cost reductions which will be accelerated in an event of a decline in business activity 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results lower general aviation fuel volumes and essentially flat weighted average fuel margins  higher interest expense related to interest rate swap break fee costs associated with prepayment of debt during  partially offset by lower compensation expense resulting from staff rationalization and decreased credit card fees stemming from lower jet fuel prices and lower activity levels

results for include sevenbar fbos from march  acquisition date to december  results for include sevenbar fbos for the year ended december  results for the two months ended february  have not been presented separately as they are not significant 

table of contents aviation related business atlantic aviation continued revenue and gross profit the majority of the revenue and gross profit in atlantic aviation is generated through fueling general aviation aircraft at the business fbos around the united states 
this revenue is categorized according to who owns the fuel used to service these aircraft 
if our business owns the fuel  they record the cost to purchase that fuel as cost of revenue fuel 
the business corresponding fuel revenue is its cost to purchase that fuel plus a margin 
the business generally pursues a strategy of maintaining  and where appropriate increasing  dollar based margins  thereby passing any increase in fuel prices to the customer 
the business also has into plane arrangements whereby it fuels aircraft with fuel owned by another party 
the business collects a fee for this service that is recorded as non fuel revenue 
other non fuel revenue includes various services such as hangar rentals  de icing and airport services 
the business revenue and gross profit are driven by fuel volume and dollar based margin per gallon 
this applies to both fuel and into plane revenue 
customers will occasionally move from one category to the other 
therefore  we believe discussing fuel and non fuel revenue and gross profit and the related key metrics on a combined basis provides a more meaningful analysis of atlantic aviation 
gross profit for declined compared to mainly due to lower volume of general aviation fuel sold 
fuel volumes declined as compared with weighted average margins  including into plane sales  were essentially flat 
excluding the results from the charter operations and management contracts business  which were sold in the second half of  gross profit from other services including hangar rentals  de icing and miscellaneous services decreased by for the year  primarily due to lower hangar rent resulting from lower transient traffic 
gross profit for the quarter ended december  decreased by compared to the fourth quarter of as a result of lower fuel volume  decreased weighted average fuel margin and weaker de icing activities 
gross profit for the fourth quarter of is sequentially flat compared to the third quarter of as de icing revenue  higher fuel volume and miscellaneous fbo services were offset by lower weighted average fuel margins resulting from customer mix 
general aviation fuel volume increased as compared to third quarter of as business jet traffic at atlantic aviation s locations improved 
selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to integration synergies and the implementation of cost reduction initiatives 
these cost savings were offset by a million increase in the bad debt reserve in the first quarter of due to the deterioration of the accounts receivables aging 
account receivables aging improved significantly since the first quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended december  declined compared to the fourth quarter of as a result of cost reduction initiatives 
operating cost sequentially increased by reflecting typical seasonality of the business driven by increase utilities expense  repairs and maintenance expense and overtime expense related to snow removal 
goodwill impairment in addition to its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter  the business performed an impairment test at the reporting unit level during the first six months of goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  as determined under a two step approach 
based on the testing performed  the business recognized goodwill impairment charges of million in the first six months of and million in the fourth quarter of  respectively 
depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to non cash impairment charges of million incurred in the first half of as compared to a non cash cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents aviation related business atlantic aviation continued interest expense  net interest expense increased despite a reduction of million of debt due to the payment of million of swap termination fees paid during income taxes income generated by atlantic aviation is included in our consolidated federal income tax return 
the business files separate state income returns in more than states in which it operates 
the tax expense in the table above includes both state taxes and the portion of the consolidated federal tax liability attributable to the business 
for purposes of determining book and taxable income  depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles are calculated differently  with additional differences between federal and state taxable income 
while the business as a whole expects to generate a current year federal income tax loss  certain entities within the business will generate state taxable income 
the current state income tax expense in was approximately  the business has approximately million of state nol carryforwards 
state nol carryforwards are specific to the state in which the nol was generated and various states impose limitations on the utilization of nol carryforwards 
therefore  the business may incur state income tax liabilities in the near future  even if consolidated state taxable income is less than million

table of contents aviation related business atlantic aviation continued revenue and gross profit the growth in gross profit at all sites was primarily due to the inclusion of the results of sites acquired in and gross profit at existing locations decreased mainly due to lower fuel volume resulting from lower general aviation activity declines of and for the quarter and the year  respectively and lower average general aviation fuel margins 
gross profit from other services at existing locations increased by in as a result of higher de icing revenue and hangar rentals in the first half of the year 
for the quarter ended december   gross profit from other services declined as a result of lower general aviation traffic 
we attribute the volume decline primarily to a decrease in general aviation transient traffic 
we believe the decline in transient traffic is due primarily to overall soft economic conditions 
the slowing economy has contributed to a general decrease in corporate activity and reduction in business related general aviation activity 
while the business seeks to maintain or increase a dollar based margin per gallon backed by a premium services offering  increased fuel prices that peaked in mid led to an increased focus on cost by some of our customers 
these customers negotiated more aggressively on fuel purchases and contributed to a decrease in our average margins through the third quarter 
declining fuel price in the fourth quarter had a favorable impact on average fuel margins 
in addition  some competitors are pursuing more aggressive pricing strategies that have also contributed to increased margin pressure 
selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses at existing locations for the year ended december  is due primarily to cost efficiencies resulting from integration of recently acquired businesses and management s actions to streamline our cost structure in response to the decline in gross profit resulting from the overall slowing of the economy 
for the quarter ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased at existing locations by million or   primarily as a result of the cost reduction initiatives 
declining fuel prices contributed approximately  to the decrease in operating costs in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in credit card fees 
the majority of the ongoing savings were fully realized during the third quarter and therefore are not completely reflected in the full year results 
goodwill impairment atlantic aviation performed an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  as determined under a two step approach 
based on the testing performed  the business recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million during depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to non cash impairment charges of million related to contractual arrangements and million related to property  equipment  land and leasehold improvements recorded during the fourth quarter of amortization expense in included a million non cash impairment charge relating to airport management contracts business  which was subsequently sold in interest expense  net the increase in interest expense in is due to the increased debt levels used to finance a portion of our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures  as well as the refinancing of the business debt facilities in october the refinancing consolidated all borrowings outstanding at the time 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources consolidated our primary cash requirements include normal operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures and debt principal payments 
our primary source of cash is operating activities  although we could borrow against existing credit facilities  issue additional llc interests or sell assets 
at march   we reclassified the outstanding balance drawn on the revolving credit facility at our non operating holding company from long term debt to current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet due to its scheduled maturity on march  during the year  we were in discussions with our lenders to convert the facility to a term loan and extend the maturity date of the million outstanding balance 
by december  we had received unanimous approval from the lenders to extend the term of the facility 
however  using the net cash proceeds we received from the sale of the non controlling interest in district energy  and cash on hand  we paid off the outstanding principal balance on december  and avoided the substantial costs that would have been incurred had the terms of the facility been amended 
shortly thereafter we elected to reduce the amount available on the revolving credit facility from million to million through to the maturity of the facility at march  we believe that our operating businesses will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet future requirements  including servicing long term debt obligations 
we base our assessment of the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources on the following assumptions our businesses and investments overall generate  and will continue to generate  significant operating cash flow  the ongoing maintenance capital expenditures associated with our businesses are modest and readily funded from their respective operating cash flow or available financing  all significant short term growth capital expenditures will be funded with cash on hand or from committed undrawn credit facilities  and we will be able to refinance  extend and or repay the principal amount of maturing long term debt on terms that can be supported by our businesses 
typically  we have capitalized our businesses  in part  using project finance style debt 
project finance style debt is limited recourse  floating rate  non amortizing debt with a medium term maturity of between five and seven years  although the principal balance on the term loan debt at atlantic aviation is being prepaid using the excess cash generated by the business 
at december   the average remaining maturity of the debt facilities across all of our businesses  including our proportional interest in the debt of imtt  was approximately years 
in light of the improvement in the functioning of the credit markets generally  and the leverage ratios and interest coverage we expect each of these businesses to produce at the maturity of their respective debt facilities  we believe that we will be able to successfully refinance the long term debt of these businesses on economically sensible terms 
the section below discusses the sources and uses of cash on a consolidated basis and for each of our businesses and investments 
all inter company activities such as corporate allocations  capital contributions to our businesses and distributions from our businesses have been excluded from the tables as these transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
prior period comparatives have been updated to also remove these inter company activities 

table of contents commitments and contingencies the following tables summarize our future obligations  due by period  as of december   under our various contractual obligations and commitments

the long term debt represents the consolidated principal obligations to various lenders 
the debt facilities  which are obligations of the operating businesses and have maturities between and  are subject to certain covenants  the violation of which could result in acceleration of the maturity dates 
capital lease obligations are for the lease of certain transportation equipment 
such equipment could be subject to repossession upon violation of the terms of the lease agreements 
this represents the minimum annual rentals required to be paid under non cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year 
the gas company currently has a time charter arrangement for the use of two barges for transporting liquefied petroleum gas between oahu and its neighbor islands 
the above table does not reflect certain long term obligations  such as deferred taxes  for which we are unable to estimate the period in which the obligation will be incurred 
in addition to these commitments and contingencies  we typically incur capital expenditures on a regular basis to maintain our existing revenue producing assets in good working order maintenance capital expenditures  and expand our existing revenue producing assets or acquire new ones growth capital expenditures 
see investing activities below for further discussion of capital expenditures 
we also have other contingencies  including pending threatened legal and administrative proceedings that are not reflected above as amounts at this time are not ascertainable

we have also incurred performance fees from time to time paid to our manager 
our manager has historically elected to reinvest these fees in our llc interests previously trust stock 
while these fees do not directly affect cash flows when paid in equity  they do result in more outstanding llc interests

nm not meaningful operating activities consolidated cash provided by operating activities mainly comprises the cash from operations of the businesses we own  as described in each of the business discussions below 
the cash flow from our consolidated business operations is partially offset by expenses paid at the corporate level  such as base management fees paid in cash  professional fees and interest on any amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility 
the decrease in consolidated cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to lower operating performance at atlantic aviation  and payment of interest rate swap breakage fees relating to the prepayment of the outstanding principal balance on atlantic aviation s term loan debt  partially offset by lower interest paid on the reduced term loan balance for atlantic aviation  reduced levels of working capital  reflecting decreased activities combined with receivable collection efforts at atlantic aviation  and improved operating results at the gas company 
we believe our operating activities overall provide a source of sustainable and stable cash flows over the long term with the opportunity for future growth due to consistent customer demand driven by the basic nature of the services provided  our strong competitive position due to factors including high initial development and construction costs  difficulty in obtaining suitable land near many of our operations for example  airports  waterfront near ports  long term concessions contracts  required government approvals  which may be difficult or time consuming to obtain  lack of cost efficient alternatives to the services we provide in the foreseeable future  and product service pricing that we expect to generally keep pace with price changes due to factors including consistent demand  limited alternatives  contractual terms  and regulatory rate setting 

table of contents investing activities the decrease in consolidated cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the absence of acquisition activity in  and the increase in cash inflow from the sale of the non controlling stake in district energy compared to the sale of two small  non core businesses at atlantic aviation in  lower capital expenditures at atlantic aviation and the gas company  partially offset by cash retained by imtt to fund growth capital expenditures during  which is expected to contribute significantly to imtt s future gross profit  and increase in capital expenditures at district energy for the expansion of a new plant 
distributions from imtt are reflected in our consolidated cash provided by operating activities only up to our share of imtt s positive earnings 
amounts in excess of this  and any distributions when imtt records a net loss  are reflected in our consolidated cash from investing activities 
for  million in equity distributions were included in cash from operations 
in  million of the million dividends received were included in cash from operating activities and million were included in investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities in our consolidated cash flows has been acquisitions of businesses in new and existing segments  the dispositions of our non us businesses and the sale of the non controlling stake in district energy 
the other main driver is capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures are generally funded by cash from operating activities and growth capital expenditures generally have been funded by drawing on our available credit facilities or by equity capital 
we may fund maintenance capital expenditures from credit facilities or equity capital and growth capital expenditures from operating activities from time to time 
we expect that our growth capital expenditures will generally be yield accretive once placed in service 
acquisitions of businesses are generally funded on a long term basis through raising additional equity capital and or project financing style credit facilities 
we have drawn on our mic inc revolving credit facility to temporarily fund some acquisitions 
in the past  we have repaid this facility with proceeds from raising additional equity and or obtaining long term project financing style facilities 
in december   with the cash proceeds we received from the sale of the non controlling interest in district energy  and cash on hand  we paid off the outstanding principal balance of the facility 
financing activities the increase in consolidated cash used in financing activities was primarily due to debt repayment during at atlantic aviation  debt draw downs in  primarily against the mic inc revolving credit facility  to fund acquisitions  and full repayment of the mic inc revolving credit facility  partially offset by the suspension of distributions to shareholders in  and the increase in debt draw downs at district energy to fund capital expenditures 
the primary drivers of cash provided by financing activities are equity offerings  debt financing of acquisitions and capital expenditures  the subsequent refinancing of our businesses and the repayment of the outstanding principal balance on maturing debt 
a smaller portion of cash provided by financing activities relates to principal payments on capital leases 
for  we expect to apply all excess cash flows from atlantic aviation to prepay the debt principal under the amended terms of the credit facility 
actual prepayment amounts through the maturity of the facility will depend on the operating performance of the business 
our businesses are capitalized with a mix of equity and project financing style long term debt 
we believe we can prudently maintain relatively high levels of leverage due to the generally sustainable and stable 
table of contents long term cash flows our businesses have provided in the past and we expect to continue in the future as discussed above 
our long term debt is non amortizing and we expect to be able to refinance the outstanding balances at maturity  except at atlantic aviation  where all excess cash flow from the business is used to prepay the outstanding principal balance of the term loan  and the last two years before maturity at district energy 
most of our businesses debt is term debt  while some of our businesses also maintain capital expenditure and or working capital facilities 
mic inc revolving credit facility effective april   we elected to reduce the available principal on its revolving credit facility from million to million and on december   further reduced the available principal to million 
this revolving credit facility is with citicorp north america inc as lender and administrative agent  wachovia bank national association  credit suisse  cayman islands branch  westlb ag  new york branch  and macquarie bank limited 
the original maturity of the facility was march  however  in february  we amended and restated the facility  extending the maturity to march the main use of the facility is to fund acquisitions  capital expenditures and to a limited extent  working capital 
the facility terminates on march  and currently bears interest at the rate of libor plus 
base rate borrowings would be at the base rate plus 
on february   we drew million on this facility  part of which was used to fund the acquisition of sevenbar fbos which was completed in the first quarter of  and part of which was used for other projects 
on july   mic inc drew an additional million on this facility to fund the acquisition of skypark  which was completed in the third quarter of on february   we repaid million of the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
at march   we reclassified the outstanding balance drawn on the revolving credit facility at the non operating holding company from long term debt to current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet due to its scheduled maturity on march  during the year  we were in discussions with our lenders to convert the facility to a term loan and extend the maturity date of the million outstanding balance

however  using the net cash proceeds it received from the sale of the non controlling interest in district energy  and cash on hand  we paid off the outstanding principal balance on december  and avoided the substantial costs that would have been incurred had the terms of the facility been amended 
shortly thereafter we elected to reduce the amount available on the revolving credit facility from million to million through to the maturity of the facility at march  we expect to retain excess cash generated by the consolidated businesses over the near term 
the borrower under the facility is mic inc  a direct subsidiary of the company  and the obligations under the facility are guaranteed by the company and secured by a pledge of the equity of all current and future direct subsidiaries of mic inc and the company 
the terms and conditions for the revolving facility include events of default  representations and warranties and covenants that are generally customary for a facility of this type 
in addition  the revolving facility includes a restriction on cross guarantees and an event of default should the manager or another member of the macquarie group cease to manage our business and operations

some customers are extended payment terms and billed accordingly 
cash is used in operating activities mainly for payments to vendors of fuel  aircraft services and professional services  as well as payroll costs and payments to tax jurisdictions 
cash provided by operating activities decreased mainly due to a decline in gross profit resulting from the decrease in volume of fuel sold  and payment of interest rate swap breakage fees associated with the prepayment of the term loan debt  partially offset by reduced interest expense  other than swap breakage fees  from lower debt levels  and collection of aged accounts receivable 
investing activities cash used in investing activities relates primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the decrease in cash used in investing activity is primarily due to the sevenbar acquisition in march and lower capital expenditures by the business

the business paid down million of debt and used the remainder of the capital contribution to pay interest rate swap breakage and debt amendment fees

adjusted ebitda definition excludes i all extraordinary or non recurring non cash income or losses during relevant the period including losses resulting from write off of goodwill or other assets  and ii any non cash income or losses due to change in market value of the hedging agreements critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting estimates and policies are discussed below 
these estimates and policies are consistent with the estimates and accounting policies followed by the businesses we own 
business combinations our acquisitions of businesses that we control are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values require significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of the gas company  district energy and atlantic aviation include contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements  trademarks  domain names  property and equipment and goodwill 
trademarks and domain names are generally considered to be indefinite life intangibles 
trademarks  domain names and goodwill are not amortized in most circumstances 
it may be appropriate to amortize some trademarks and domain names 
however  for unamortized intangible assets  we are required to perform annual impairment reviews and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the 
table of contents fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which included the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the gas company  district energy and atlantic aviation are separate reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
the impairment test for trademarks and domain names  which are not amortized  requires the determination of the fair value of such assets 
if the fair value of the trademarks and domain names is less than their carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or material negative change in relationship with significant customers 
property and equipment is initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset remains in service assuming normal routine maintenance 
we review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they do not properly reflect the consumption of economic benefits embodied in the property and equipment nor result in the appropriate matching of cost against revenue 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
significant intangibles  including contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
with respect to contract rights in atlantic aviation  we take into consideration the history of contract right renewals in determining our assessment of useful life and the corresponding amortization period 
we perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or circumstances indicate that assets are less than their carrying amount and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount of the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
any impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of reporting units and fair value of property and equipment and intangible assets is determined by our management and is generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
we use outside valuation experts when management considers that it is appropriate to do so 
we test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets when there is an indicator of impairment 
impairments of goodwill  property  equipment  land and leasehold improvements and intangible assets during  and relating to atlantic aviation  are discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations in part ii  item revenue recognition the gas company recognizes revenue when the services are provided 
sales of gas to customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis 
most revenue is based upon consumption  however  certain revenue is based upon a flat rate 
district energy recognizes revenue from cooling capacity and consumption at the time of performance of service 
cash received from customers for services to be provided in the future are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized over the expected services period on a straight line basis 

table of contents fuel revenue from atlantic aviation is recorded when fuel is provided or when services are rendered 
atlantic aviation also records hangar rental fees  which are recognized during the month for which service is provided 
hedging we have in place variable rate debt 
management believes that it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments 
to meet this objective  the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk on a majority of its debt with a variable rate component 
as of february  for atlantic aviation and effective april  for our other businesses  we elected to discontinue hedge accounting 
from the dates that hedge accounting was discontinued  all movements in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded directly through earnings 
as a result of the discontinuance of hedge accounting  we will reclassify into earnings net derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of the existing interest rate swaps 
our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value of interest rate swaps recorded directly through earnings 
we measure derivative instruments at fair value using the income approach  which discounts the future net cash settlements expected under the derivative contracts to a present value 
see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities in our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  for further discussion 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment

interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the borrowings of our businesses
