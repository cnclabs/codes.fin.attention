non serialized directv inventories consist primarily of satellite dishes  poles and similar devices which are supplied by directv

impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  equipment  leasehold improvements and intangibles  subject to amortization 
at december   the company had net property and equipment of  which represents approximately of the company s total assets 
at december   the company had net intangibles of  which represented approximately of the company s total assets see note 
the company reviews its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
an impairment loss shall be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
for the hsp segment  the income approach was used to measure fair value for those long lived assets 
the income approach was based on the present value of five years of future cash flows with an assumed growth of while applying a discount rate 
for the mdu segment  the market approach considering market multiples from comparable transactions were used to measure fair value of those long lived assets 
comparable transactions were identified based on their similarities to the reporting unit with similar features  age of equipment  and length of roe contracts 
there was no impairment noted for either segment at december  or impairment of goodwill in accordance with asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and intangible assets without a defined life shall not be amortized over a defined period  but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step impairment test 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company s estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business models  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect the company s future financial results 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the activities in the second step include valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the impaired reporting unit based on their fair value and determining the fair value of the impaired reporting unit s goodwill based upon the residual of the summed identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses  which amounts to  as of december   may be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
during the year ended december   the company did not record any impairment related to goodwill 
in  the company recorded an impairment of on the goodwill related to the us install purchase and the remaining goodwill balance of from a previous acquisition 
during the year ended december   the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill

stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock options using fair value for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors 
the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the company s expected stock price volatility  and actual and projected stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures 
income taxes the company accounts for deferred tax assets and liabilities under the liability method

we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts we believe to be realizable 
we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets was appropriate as of december  and disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect these contractual obligations including interest payments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods total year or less years over years operating leases buildings related party debt short term long term debt long term debt  related party capital leases totals page forward looking statements from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  and similar matters
