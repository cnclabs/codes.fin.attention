table of contents run off operations effectively managing the various exposures of its run off operations is important to the company s ongoing profitability  operating cash flows and available capital 
the results are influenced by a range of economic factors  especially movements in equity markets and interest rates 
in order to substantially reduce the impact of equity market movements on the liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb  also known as vadbe  the company operates an equity hedge program 
the company actively monitors the performance of the hedge program  and evaluates the cost benefit of hedging other risks 
results are also influenced by behavioral factors  including future partial surrender election rates for gmdb contracts  annuity election rates for guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib contracts  annuitant lapse rates  as well as the collection of amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires 
the company actively studies policyholder behavior experience and adjusts future expectations based on the results of the studies  as warranted 
the company also performs regular audits of ceding companies to ensure that premiums received and claims paid properly reflect the underlying risks  and to maximize the probability of subsequent collection of claims from retrocessionaires 
finally  the company monitors the financial strength and credit standing of the retrocessionaires and establishes or collects collateral when warranted 
summary the company s overall results are influenced by a range of economic and other factors  especially cost trends and inflation for medical and related services  utilization patterns of medical and other services  employment levels  the tort liability system  developments in the political environment both domestically and internationally  including efforts to reform the us health care system  interest rates  equity market returns  foreign currency fluctuations and credit market volatility  including the availability and cost of credit in the future  and federal  state and international regulation 
the company regularly monitors the trends impacting operating results from the above mentioned key factors to appropriately respond to economic and other factors affecting its operations 
the company s ability to achieve its financial objectives is dependent upon its ability to effectively execute on its strategy and to appropriately respond to emerging economic  industry and company specific trends

table of contents initiatives to lower operating expenses as part of its strategy  the company has undertaken several initiatives to realign its organization and consolidate support functions in an effort to increase efficiency and responsiveness to customers and to reduce costs 
during and  the company conducted a comprehensive review to reduce the operating expenses of its ongoing businesses cost reduction program 
as a result  the company recognized severance related and real estate charges in other operating expenses 
severance charges in and resulted from reductions of approximately  positions in the company s workforce 
cost reduction activity for and was as follows pre tax in millions severance real estate total fourth quarter charge balance carried to january  second quarter third quarter fourth quarter subtotal charges less payments balance  december  the health care segment recorded million pre tax million after tax of the charges and million pre tax million after tax of the charge 
the remainder of the and charges were reported as follows disability and life million pre tax million after tax in and million pre tax million after tax in  and international million pre tax million after tax in and million pre tax million after tax in substantially all severance is expected to be paid by the end of upon completion of the job eliminations  the company expects annualized after tax savings from this cost reduction program to be approximately million in and beyond 
a portion of the savings was realized in while most is expected to be realized in 
table of contents consolidated results of operations the company measures the financial results of its segments using segment earnings loss  which is defined as shareholders income loss from continuing operations before after tax realized investment results 
adjusted income from operations is defined as consolidated segment earnings loss excluding special items defined below and the results of the gmib business 
adjusted income from operations is another measure of profitability used by the company s management because it presents the underlying results of operations of the company s businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue  expenses and shareholders net income 
this measure is not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measure  which is shareholders income from continuing operations 
summarized below is a reconciliation between shareholders income from continuing operations and adjusted income from operations

table of contents overview of consolidated results of operations shareholders income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was significantly higher than  reflecting improved adjusted income from operations  as explained below  as well as the following substantially improved results in the gmib business due to improved equity market conditions and generally higher interest rates  improved realized investment results  also reflecting better market conditions during  and the favorable year over year impact of the following special items as noted in the above table completion of the irs examination  the curtailment gain on the pension plan  and the absence of litigation charges in adjusted income from operations increased in compared with  primarily reflecting significantly improved results in the run off reinsurance segment due to a lower amount of reserve strengthening for the gmdb business in compared with this result was primarily due to improved equity market conditions in also  in the aggregate  adjusted income from operations from the company s ongoing operating segments health care  disability and life  and international improved slightly in over these favorable effects were partially offset by higher unallocated costs including interest reported in corporate 
overview of consolidated results of operations shareholders income from continuing operations for the year ended december  declined significantly compared with  reflecting lower adjusted income from operations as explained below  as well as the following higher losses in the gmib business  reflecting the deterioration in the financial markets in and the effect of adopting new fair value guidance  significant net realized investment losses primarily due to impairments caused largely by the deterioration in the financial markets 
these losses were partially offset by gains on the sale of real estate  and special charges for litigation and cost reduction matters discussed below 
adjusted income from operations decreased in compared with due to losses in the gmdb business resulting from the adverse equity market conditions in  partially offset by higher earnings in each of the company s ongoing operating segments 
special items and gmib management does not believe that the special items noted in the table above are representative of the company s underlying results of operations 
accordingly  the company excluded these special items from adjusted income from operations in order to facilitate an understanding and comparison of results of operations and permit analysis of trends in underlying revenue  expenses and shareholders income from continuing operations 
special items for included a curtailment gain resulting from the decision to freeze the pension plan see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information  cost reduction charges related to the previously announced cost reduction program see the introduction section of the md a beginning on page of this form k  and benefits resulting from the completion of the and irs examinations see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
special items for included a cost reduction charge related to the previously announced cost reduction program see the introduction section of the md a beginning on page of this form k  a litigation matter related to the cigna pension plan see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information reported in corporate and charges related to certain other litigation matters  which are reported in the health care segment 
the special item for consisted of previously unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the completion of the irs examination for the and tax years 
the company also excludes the results of the gmib business from adjusted income from operations because the fair value of gmib assets and liabilities must be recalculated each quarter using updated capital market assumptions 
the resulting changes in fair value  which are reported in shareholders net income  are volatile and unpredictable 
see the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of this form k for more information on the effect of capital market assumption changes on shareholders net income 
because of this volatility  and since the gmib business is in run off  management does not believe that its results are meaningful in assessing underlying results of operations 

table of contents outlook for the company expects adjusted income from operations to be comparable to or slightly higher than information is not available for management to reasonably estimate the future results of the gmib business or realized investment results due in part to interest rate and stock market volatility and other internal and external factors 
this outlook includes an assumption that gmdb also known as vadbe results will be approximately break even for full year  reflective of the company s view that the long term reserve assumptions are appropriate and assumes that capital markets remain stable during the year 
in addition  the company is not able to identify or reasonably estimate the financial impact of special items in however they may include potential adjustments associated with cost reduction  litigation  and tax related items 
the company s outlook for is subject to the factors cited in the cautionary statement beginning on page of this form k and the sensitivities discussed in the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of this form k 
if unfavorable equity market and interest rate movements occur  the company could experience losses related to investment impairments and the gmib and gmdb businesses 
these losses could adversely impact the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition by potentially reducing the capital of the company s insurance subsidiaries and reducing their dividend paying capabilities 
revenues total revenues decreased by in  compared with  and increased by in compared with changes in the components of total revenue are described more fully below 
premiums and fees premiums and fees decreased by in  compared with  reflecting membership declines in health care resulting from higher unemployment and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation in international  offset by the absence of premium and fees from the acquired business in the first quarter of since this business was acquired april  premiums and fees increased by in  compared with reflecting the impact of the acquired business  growth in the disability and life segment  as well as growth and rate increases in the international segment 
see segment reporting discussions for additional details 
net investment income net investment income decreased by in  compared with  primarily due to lower income from real estate funds and security partnerships  unfavorable foreign exchange rates and lower investment yields partially offset by higher invested assets 
net investment income decreased by in  compared with  primarily due to lower yields driven by declines in short term interest rates  commercial mortgage pre payment fees  and income from security partnerships 
mail order pharmacy revenues mail order pharmacy revenues increased by in  compared with  primarily due to rate increases and by in  compared with due to increased script volume and rate increases 
other revenues other revenues include the impact of futures contracts associated with the gmdb equity hedge program 
in  the company reported losses of million associated with the gmdb equity hedge program  compared with gains of million in the losses in primarily reflected increases in stock market values  while the gains in primarily reflected declines in stock market values 
excluding the impact of the futures contracts associated with the gmdb equity hedge program  other revenues decreased in  compared with  primarily reflecting declines in amortization of deferred gains on the sales of the retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses 
excluding the impact of the futures contracts associated with the gmdb equity hedge program  other revenues increased in  compared with  primarily reflecting the impact of the acquired business 
in  the company reported a gain of million associated with the gmdb equity hedge program  compared with a loss of million in 
table of contents realized investment results realized investment results in were significantly improved compared to primarily due to lower asset write downs on fixed maturities largely reflecting improved market conditions  gains on sales of fixed maturities and equities in compared with losses in  and gains on hybrid securities in compared with losses in changes in fair value for these securities are reported in realized investment results 
these favorable effects were partially offset by higher impairments of investments in real estate entities and commercial mortgage loans in due to the impact of the continued weak economic environment on the commercial real estate market and the absence of significant gains on the sales of real estate ventures reported during realized investment results in were lower than in  primarily due to higher losses associated with asset write downs and increases in valuation allowances primarily due to higher interest rates and credit losses resulting from adverse economic conditions during in addition  the company had higher losses on sales of fixed maturities and equity securities 
these losses were partially offset by higher gains on sales of real estate investments held in joint ventures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table  there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits other than those identified in the following table  as well as estimates with respect to goodwill  unpaid claims and claim expenses  postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions  certain compensation accruals  and income taxes 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact the company 

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used future policy benefits guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb also known as vadbe these liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to be paid  less the present value of net future premiums expected to be received 
the amounts to be paid represent the excess of the guaranteed death benefit over the values of contractholders accounts 
the death benefit coverage in force at december  representing the amount payable if all of approximately  contractholders had submitted death claims as of that date was approximately billion 
liabilities for future policy benefits for these contracts as of december were as follows in millions the company estimates these liabilities based on assumptions for lapse  partial surrender  mortality  interest rates mean investment performance and discount rate  and volatility 
these assumptions are based on the company s experience and future expectations over the long term period 
the company monitors actual experience to update these estimates as necessary 
lapse refers to the full surrender of an annuity prior to a contractholder s death 
partial surrender refers to the fact that most contractholders have the ability to withdraw substantially all of their mutual fund investments while retaining any available death benefit coverage in effect at the time of the withdrawal 
once a partial surrender is made  the liability increases reflecting lower future assumed premiums  a lower likelihood of lapse  and a lower likelihood of account values recovering sufficiently to reduce the death benefit exposure in future periods 
these effects are not covered by the company s gmdb equity hedge program 
market declines could expose the company to higher amounts of death benefit exposure that can be retained by contractholders subsequent to a significant partial surrender and to higher election rates of future partial surrenders 
thus  if equity markets decline  the company s liability for partial surrenders increases and there is no corresponding offset from the hedge program 
the election rate for expected future partial surrenders is updated quarterly based on emerging experience 
interest rates include both a the mean investment performance assumption  and b the liability discount rate assumption 
the mean investment performance for underlying equity mutual funds considers the company s gmdb equity hedge program which reflects the average short term interest rate to be earned over the life of the program 
the mean investment performance for underlying fixed income mutual funds considers the expected market return over the life of the contracts 
current assumptions used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
based on current and historical market  industry and company specific experience and management s judgment  the company believes that it is reasonably likely that the unfavorable changes in the key assumptions and or conditions described below could occur 
if these unfavorable assumption changes were to occur  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income would be as follows increase in mortality rates million decrease in lapse rates million increase in election rates for future partial surrenders million basis point decrease in interest rates mean investment performance million discount rate million increase in volatility million as of december   if contractholder account values invested in underlying equity mutual funds declined by due to equity market performance  the after tax decrease in shareholders net income resulting from an increase in the provision for partial surrenders would be approximately million 
as of december   if contractholder account values invested in underlying bond money market mutual funds declined by due to bond money market performance  the after tax decrease in shareholders net income resulting from an increase in the provision for partial surrenders and an increase in unhedged exposure would be approximately million 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment 
volatility refers to the degree of variation of future market returns of the underlying mutual fund investments 
health care medical claims payable medical claims payable for the health care segment include both reported claims and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported 
liabilities for medical claims payable as of december were as follows in millions gross  net gross  net these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and other recoverables 
these liabilities generally exclude amounts for administrative services only business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company develops estimates for health care medical claims payable using actuarial principles and assumptions based on historical and projected claim payment patterns  medical cost trends  which are impacted by the utilization of medical services and the related costs of the services provided unit costs  benefit design  seasonality  and other relevant operational factors 
the company consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each reporting period  with consideration given to the variability of these factors  and recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability within a level of confidence  as required by actuarial standards of practice  which require that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions 
the company s estimate of the liability for medical claims incurred but not yet reported is primarily calculated using historical claim payment patterns and expected medical cost trends 
the company analyzes the historical claim payment patterns by comparing the dates claims were incurred  generally the dates services were provided  to the dates claims were paid to determine completion factors  which are a measure of the time to process claims 
a completion factor is calculated for each month of incurred claims 
the company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors 
the company estimates the ultimate liability for claims incurred in each month by applying the current estimates of completion factors to the current paid claims data 
for the year ended december   actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions  resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims payable or of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended december  for the year ended december   actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions  resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims  or of the current year incurred claims reported for the year ended december  specifically  the favorable impact is due to faster than expected completion factors and lower than expected medical cost trends  both of which included an assumption for moderately adverse experience 
the corresponding impact of favorable prior year development on net income was not material for the year ended december  the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical claims payable liability does not directly correspond to an increase or decrease in shareholders net income 

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used the difference between this estimate of the ultimate liability and the current paid claims data is the estimate of the remaining claims to be paid for each incurral month 
these monthly estimates are aggregated and included in the company s health care medical claims payable at the end of each reporting period 
completion factors are used to estimate the health care medical claims payable for all months where claims have not been completely resolved and paid  except for the most recent month as described below 
completion factors are impacted by several key items including changes in the level of claims processed electronically versus manually auto adjudication  changes in provider claims submission rates  membership changes and the mix of products 
as noted  the company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors 
this approach implicitly assumes that historical completion rates will be a useful indicator for the current period 
it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns  which could have a material impact on the company s medical claims payable and net income 
claims incurred in the most recent month have limited paid claims data  since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to the company for payment in the month services have been provided 
this makes the completion factor approach less reliable for claims incurred in the most recent month 
as a result  in any reporting period  for the estimates of the ultimate claims incurred in the most recent month  the company primarily relies on medical cost trend analysis  which reflects expected claim payment patterns and other relevant operational considerations 
medical cost trend is impacted by several key factors including medical service utilization and unit costs and the company s ability to manage these factors through benefit design  underwriting  provider contracting and the company s medical management initiatives 
these factors are affected by changes in the level and mix of medical benefits offered  including inpatient  outpatient and pharmacy  the impact of copays and deductibles  changes in provider practices and changes in consumer demographics and consumption behavior 
because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends  the trend experienced for the most recent history along with an analysis of emerging trends  have been taken into consideration in establishing the liability for medical claims payable at december  and it is possible that the actual medical trend for the current period will develop differently from the expected  which could have a material impact on the company s medical claims payable and net income 
for each reporting period  the company evaluates key assumptions by comparing the assumptions used in establishing the medical claims payable to actual experience 
when actual experience differs from the assumptions used in establishing the liability  medical claims payable are increased or decreased through current period net income 
additionally  the company evaluates expected future developments and emerging trends which may impact key assumptions 
the estimation process involves considerable judgment  reflecting the variability inherent in forecasting future claim payments 
the adequacy of these estimates is highly sensitive to changes in the company s key assumptions  specifically completion factors  which are impacted by actual or expected changes in the submission and payment of medical claims  and medical cost trends  which are impacted by actual or expected changes in the utilization of medical services and unit costs 

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and other assets guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib these liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to be paid  less the present value of net future premiums expected to be received 
the amounts to be paid represent the excess of the expected value of the income benefit over the value of the annuitants accounts at the time of annuitization 
the assets associated with these contracts represent receivables in connection with reinsurance that the company has purchased from two external reinsurers  which covers of the exposures on these contracts 
as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements  the company implemented new guidance for fair value measurements on january  at adoption  the company was required to change certain assumptions to reflect those that it believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine an exit price 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million after tax  net of reinsurance million pre tax 
liabilities related to these contracts as of december  were as follows in millions as of december  estimated amounts receivable related to these contracts from two external reinsurers  were as follows in millions the company considers the various assumptions used to estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities associated with these contracts in two categories capital market inputs  and future annuitant behavior and other assumptions 
capital market inputs include market returns and discount rates  claim interest rates and market volatility 
this group of assumptions is largely based on market observable inputs 
interest rates include a market returns  b the liability discount rate assumption and c the projected interest rates used to calculate the reinsured income benefit at the time of annuitization claim interest rate 
volatility refers to the degree of variation of future market returns of the underlying mutual fund investments 
the second group of assumptions consists of future annuitant behavior and other inputs  and includes annuity election rates  lapse  mortality  nonperformance risk for both the company and its retrocessionnaires  and a risk and profit charge 
this group of assumptions is based on the company s experience  industry data  and management s judgment 
annuity election rates refer to the proportion of annuitants who elect to receive their income benefit as an annuity 
lapse refers to the full surrender of an annuity prior to annuitization of the policy 
nonperformance risk refers to the market s perception that either the company will not fulfill its gmib liability own credit or the company will not collect on its gmib retrocessional coverage reinsurer credit risk 
risk and profit charge refers to the amount that a hypothetical market participant would include in the valuation to cover the uncertainty of outcomes and the desired return on capital 
current assumptions used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operations are expected to be volatile in future periods because most capital market assumptions will be based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each period including interest rates and market implied volatilities 
based on current and historical market  industry and company specific experience and management s judgment  the company believes that it is reasonably likely that the unfavorable changes in the key assumptions and or conditions described below could occur 
if these unfavorable assumption changes were to occur  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income  net of estimated amounts receivable from reinsurers  would be as follows basis point decrease in interest rates which are aligned with libor used for projecting market returns and discounting million basis point decrease in interest rates used for projecting claim exposure year treasury rates million increase in implied market volatility million decrease in mortality million increase in annuity election rates million decrease in lapse rates million increase to the risk and profit charge million market declines which reduce annuitants account values expose the company to higher potential claims which results in a larger net liability 
if annuitants account values invested in underlying equity mutual funds as of december  declined by due to equity market performance  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income  net of estimated amounts receivable from reinsurers  would be approximately million 
if annuitants account values invested in underlying bond money market mutual funds as of december  declined by due to bond money market performance  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income  net of estimated amounts receivable from reinsurers  would be approximately million 
if credit default swap spreads used to evaluate the nonperformance risk of the company were to narrow or the credit rating of its principal life insurance subsidiary were to improve  it would cause a decrease in the discount rate of the gmib liability  resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 
if the discount rate decreased by bps due to this  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income would be approximately million 

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used if credit default swap spreads used to evaluate the nonperformance risk of the company s gmib retrocessionnaires were to widen or the retrocessionnaires credit ratings were to weaken  it would cause an increase in the discount rate of the gmib asset  resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 
if the discount rate increased by bps due to this  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income would be approximately million 
all of these estimated impacts due to unfavorable changes in assumptions could vary from quarter to quarter depending on actual reserve levels  the actual market conditions or changes in the anticipated view of a hypothetical market participant as of any future valuation date 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment in gmib expense 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables in run off reinsurance collectability of reinsurance recoverables requires an assessment of risks that such amounts will not be collected  including risks associated with reinsurer default and disputes with reinsurers regarding applicable coverage 
gross and net reinsurance recoverables in the run off reinsurance segment as of december  were as follows in millions the amount of reinsurance recoverables in the run off reinsurance segment  net of reserves  represents management s best estimate of recoverability  including an assessment of the financial strength of reinsurers 
a reduction of net reinsurance recoverables due to uncollectability at december   would reduce shareholders net income by approximately million after tax 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
gross  net gross  net accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities pension liabilities these liabilities are estimates of the present value of the qualified and nonqualified pension benefits to be paid attributed to employee service to date net of the fair value of plan assets 
the accrued pension benefit liability as of december was as follows in millions see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company estimates these liabilities and the related expense with actuarial models using various assumptions including discount rates and an expected long term return on plan assets 
discount rates are set by applying actual annualized yields at various durations from the citigroup pension liability curve  without adjustment  to the expected cash flows of the pension liabilities 
the expected long term return on plan assets for the domestic qualified pension plan is developed considering actual historical returns  expected long term market conditions  plan asset mix and management s investment strategy 
in addition  to measure pension costs the company uses a market related asset value method for domestic qualified pension plan assets invested in non fixed income investments  which are approximately of total plan assets 
this method recognizes the difference between actual and expected returns in the non fixed income portfolio over years  a method that reduces the short term impact of market fluctuations on pension cost 
at december   the market related asset value was approximately billion compared with a market value of billion 
using past experience  the company expects that it is reasonably possible that a favorable or unfavorable change in these key assumptions of basis points could occur 
an unfavorable change is a decrease in these key assumptions with resulting impacts as discussed below 
if discount rates for the qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased by basis points annual pension costs for would decrease by approximately million  after tax  and the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million as of december  if the expected long term return on domestic qualified pension plan assets decreased by basis points  annual pension costs for would increase by approximately million  after tax 
if the company used the market value of assets to measure pension costs as opposed to the market related value  annual pension cost for would increase by approximately million  after tax 

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used the accumulated unrecognized actuarial loss of billion at december  primarily reflects the significant decline in the value of equity securities during the actuarial loss is adjusted for unrecognized changes in market related asset values and amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants if the adjusted loss exceeds of the market related value of plan assets or of the projected benefit obligation  whichever is greater 
as of december   approximately billion of the adjusted actuarial loss exceeded of the projected benefit obligation 
as a result  approximately million after tax will be expensed in net income 
for the year ended december   million after tax was expensed in net income 
if the december  fair values of domestic qualified plan assets decreased by  the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million 
an increase in these key assumptions would result in impacts to annual pension costs  the accrued pension liability and shareholders equity in an opposite direction  but similar amounts 
investments fixed maturities recognition of losses from other than temporary impairments of public and private placement fixed maturities to assess whether a fixed maturity s decline in fair value below its amortized cost is other than temporary  the company evaluates the expected recovery in value and its intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale of the fixed maturity prior to an expected recovery 
when the company does not expect to recover a fixed maturity s amortized cost  its fair value and expected future cash flows must be estimated by management to record an impairment loss 
the credit portion of an impairment loss is recognized in net income and measured as the difference between a fixed maturity s amortized cost and the net present value of its projected future cash flows 
the non credit portion  if any  is recognized in a separate component of shareholders equity 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s accounting policies for fixed maturities 
when evaluating whether a loss is other than temporary  the company considers factors including  length of time and severity of decline  financial health and specific near term prospects of the issuer  changes in the regulatory  economic or general market environment of the issuer s industry or geographic region  and the company s intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale prior to recovery 
management estimates other than temporary impairments based on fair values using quoted market prices for public securities with active markets and generally the present value of future cash flows for private placement bonds and other public securities 
expected future cash flows for each fixed maturity are based on the company s assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors  including the probability of default  and the estimated timing and amount of any recovery in value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s fair value measurements 
the company recognized other than temporary impairments of investments in fixed maturities as follows in millions  after tax for all fixed maturities with cost in excess of their fair value  if this excess was determined to be other than temporary  shareholders net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million after tax 
for private placement bonds considered impaired  a decrease of of all expected future cash flows for the impaired bonds would reduce shareholders net income by approximately million after tax

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used investments commercial mortgage loans valuation reserves recognition of losses from valuation reserves for impaired commercial mortgage loans to determine whether a commercial mortgage loan is impaired  the company evaluates the likelihood of collecting all interest and principal payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the original loan agreement 
when it is probable that the company will not collect amounts due according to the terms of the original loan agreement  a loan is considered impaired and the company must estimate the fair value of the underlying property to measure an impairment loss 
an impairment loss is recorded using a valuation allowance for an impaired commercial mortgage loan s carrying value in excess of the estimated fair value of its underlying property 
changes to valuation reserves are recorded in realized investment gains losses 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s accounting policies for commercial mortgage loans 
the company s evaluation of the likelihood of collecting all contractual payments and the collateral fair value for commercial mortgage loans is a qualitative and quantitative process which is subject to uncertainties 
the company carefully evaluates all facts and circumstances for each loan and its supporting collateral 
when evaluating the likelihood of collecting the contractual payments of a commercial mortgage loan  the company considers factors including financial statements  budgets and operating plans for the property  inspection reports of the property completed by third party servicers  debt service coverage of the underlying collateral  the borrower s continuing financial commitment to the property  and conditions and factors pertinent to the property and its local market 
when it becomes probable that all contractual payments will not be collected according to the terms of the original loan agreement  the company calculates the estimated fair value of the underlying property based on a year discounted cash flow analysis 
factors key to this valuation include the following if property values declined by across the commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of december   approximately of the portfolio s loans would have carrying values in excess of their underlying properties fair values totaling approximately million 
and if each of these loans were considered impaired as of december   shareholders net income would decrease by approximately million after tax 
if underlying property values declined by for impaired commercial mortgage loans with valuation reserves as of december   shareholders net income would decrease by approximately million after tax 
net operating income of the property  rental and growth rates for the property and its local market  capital requirements for the property  and current market discount and capitalization rates 
these evaluations are based primarily on an in depth review of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio which is completed annually in the third quarter 
the company updates this annual review as material changes in these factors are identified

this loss was primarily related to declines in equity markets and interest rates and increased market volatility 
adjusted loss from operations for run off reinsurance in compared with was also negatively impacted by reduced favorable settlement activity related to personal accident and workers compensation 
see the benefits and expenses section for further discussion around the results of the gmib and gmdb businesses 
other revenues other revenues included pre tax losses of million in from futures contracts used in the gmdb equity hedge program see note to the consolidated financial statements  compared with pre tax gains of million in and pre tax losses of million in amounts reflecting corresponding changes in liabilities for gmdb contracts were included in benefits and expenses consistent with gaap when a premium deficiency exists see below other benefits and expenses 
the company held futures contract positions related to this program with a notional amount of billion at december  benefits and expenses benefits and expenses were comprised of the following in millions gmib income expense other benefits and expenses benefits and expenses gmib income expense 
under the gaap guidance for fair value measurements  the company s results of operations are expected to be volatile in future periods because capital market assumptions needed to estimate the assets and liabilities for the gmib business are based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each reporting period including interest rates libor swap curve and market implied volatilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about assumptions and asset and liability balances related to gmib 
for the pre tax income for gmib was million  and was primarily due to the following factors increases in interest rates million  increases in underlying account values in the period  driven by favorable equity market and bond fund returns  resulting in reduced exposures million  specific adjustments to nonperformance risk for the company net of nonperformance risk of its reinsurers million  and updates to the risk and profit charge estimates million 
these favorable effects were partially offset by higher than expected claim experience million  increases to the annuitization assumption  reflecting higher utilization experience million  updates to the lapse assumption million  updates to fund correlation assumptions million  and other amounts  including experience varying from assumptions  model and in force updates million 

table of contents gmib expense in includes a pre tax charge of million for the adoption of the fasb s fair value disclosure and measurement guidance  which is discussed in notes b and to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the charge on adoption of the fasb s fair value disclosure and measurement guidance  the gmib business generated additional pre tax expense of million in primarily as a result of decreases in interest rates since december  million  the impact of declines in underlying account values in the period  driven by declines in equity markets and bond fund returns during  resulting in increased exposure million  updates to the risk and profit charge estimate million  updates to other assumptions that are used in the fair value calculation million  and other amounts including the compounding effects of declines in interest rates and equity markets  as well as experience varying from assumptions million 
excluding the charge to update assumptions for annuity elections and lapse rates  the gmib business generated additional pre tax expense of million in  primarily the result of unfavorable annuitization and lapse experience 
the gmib liabilities and related assets are calculated using a complex internal model and assumptions from the viewpoint of a hypothetical market participant 
this resulting liability and related asset is higher than the company believes will ultimately be required to settle claims primarily because market observable interest rates are used to project growth in account values of the underlying mutual funds to estimate fair value from the viewpoint of a hypothetical market participant 
the company s payments for gmib claims are expected to occur over the next to years and will be based on actual values of the underlying mutual funds and the year treasury rate at the dates benefits are elected 
management does not believe that current market observable interest rates reflect actual growth expected for the underlying mutual funds over that timeframe  and therefore believes that the recorded liability and related asset do not represent what management believes will ultimately be required as this business runs off 
however  significant declines in mutual fund values that underlie the contracts increasing the exposure to the company together with declines in the year treasury rates used to determine claim payments similar to what occurred during would increase the expected amount of claims that would be paid out for contractholders who choose to annuitize 
it is also possible that such unfavorable market conditions would have an impact on the level of contractholder annuitizations  particularly if these unfavorable market conditions persisted for an extended period 
other benefits and expenses 
other benefits and expenses reflected income for  compared to expense during this fluctuation reflects the impact of significant improvements in the equity markets on guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts  compared with equity market declines during equity market improvements result in increases in the underlying annuity account values  which decreases the exposure under the contracts 
equity market declines result in decreases in the underlying annuity account values  which increases the exposure under the contracts 
these changes in benefits expense are partially offset by futures gains and losses  discussed in other revenues above 
although benefit expenses included reserve strengthening of million million after tax to increase gmdb reserves  no additional reserve strengthening was required for gmdb after the first quarter  primarily due to the stabilization and recovery of equity markets 
the components of the first quarter reserve strengthening were adverse impacts of overall market declines of million million after tax 
this includes a million million after tax primarily related to the provision for future partial surrenders and b million million after tax related to declines in the values of contractholders non equity investments such as bond funds  neither of which is included in the gmdb equity hedge program  adverse volatility related impacts of million million after tax due to turbulent equity market conditions  including higher than expected claims and the performance of the diverse mix of equity fund investments held by contractholders being different than expected  and adverse interest rate impacts of million million after tax 
interest rate risk is not covered by the gmdb equity hedge program  and the interest rate returns on the futures contracts were less than the company s long term assumption for mean investment performance 

table of contents during  the company recorded additional other benefits expenses of million million after tax primarily to strengthen gmdb reserves following an analysis of experience and reserve assumptions 
these amounts were due to adverse impacts of overall market declines of million million after tax 
this includes a million million after tax related to the provision for partial surrenders  including million million after tax for an increase in the assumed election rates for future partial surrenders and b million million after tax related to declines in the values of contractholders non equity investments such as bond funds  neither of which is included in the gmdb equity hedge program  adverse volatility related impacts due to turbulent equity market conditions 
volatility risk is not covered by the gmdb equity hedge program 
also  the equity market volatility  particularly during the second half of the year  impacted the effectiveness of the hedge program 
in aggregate  these volatility related impacts totaled million million after tax 
the gmdb equity hedge program is designed so that changes in the value of a portfolio of actively managed futures contracts will offset changes in the liability resulting from equity market movements 
in periods of equity market declines  the liability will increase  the program is designed to produce gains on the futures contracts to offset the increase in the liability 
however  the program will not perfectly offset the change in the liability  in part because the market does not offer futures contracts that exactly match the diverse mix of equity fund investments held by contractholders  and because there is a time lag between changes in underlying contractholder mutual funds  and corresponding changes in the hedge position 
in  the impact of this mismatch was higher than most prior periods due to the relatively large changes in market indices from day to day 
in addition  the number of futures contracts used in the program is adjusted only when certain tolerances are exceeded and in periods of highly volatile equity markets when actual volatility exceeds the expected volatility assumed in the liability calculation  losses will result 
these conditions have had an adverse impact on earnings  and during  the increase in the liability due to equity market movements was only partially offset by the results of the futures contracts  and adverse interest rate impacts 
interest rate risk is not covered by the gmdb equity hedge program  and the interest rate returns on the futures contracts were less than the company s long term assumption for mean investment performance generating an additional million million after tax 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about assumptions and reserve balances related to gmdb 
segment summary the company s payment obligations for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the company under these contracts are based on ceding companies claim payments 
for gmdb and gmib  claim payments vary because of changes in equity markets and interest rates  as well as mortality and policyholder behavior 
for workers compensation and personal accident  the claim payments relate to accidents and injuries 
any of these claim payments can extend many years into the future  and the amount of the ceding companies ultimate claims  and therefore the amount of the company s ultimate payment obligations and corresponding ultimate collection from retrocessionaires may not be known with certainty for some time 
the company s reserves for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the company  as well as for amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires  are considered appropriate as of december   based on current information 
however  it is possible that future developments  which could include but are not limited to worse than expected claim experience and higher than expected volatility  could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the company bears the risk of loss if its payment obligations to cedents increase or if its retrocessionaires are unable to meet  or successfully challenge  their reinsurance obligations to the company

industry developments and other matters proposed health care reform addressing the affordability and availability of health insurance  including reducing the number of uninsured  is a major initiative of president obama and the us congress  and proposals that may address these issues are pending in the us congress 
the proposals vary and include measures that would change the dynamics of the health care industry and or the employer s role in the provision of benefits  such as the potential creation of a new government run health plan s that would compete with the company and other private health plans  the potential creation of federal or state level exchanges or similar constructs that could serve as a distribution mechanism and or additional regulatory structure for certain segments of the health care market  potential changes to medical coverage  such as expansion of eligibility under existing public programs  minimum medical benefit ratios for health plans  and mandatory issuance of insurance coverage  requirements that would limit the ability of health plans and insurers to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk  and new taxes and assessments specific to health care insurers and or certain benefit plan designs 
any comprehensive health care reform package enacted will likely be phased in over a number of years and would be subject to a broader regulatory process 
because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives and the numerous steps required to implement them the company remains uncertain as to the ultimate impact these changes will have on its business

other matters the disability industry is under continuing review by regulators and legislators with respect to its offset practices regarding social security disability insurance ssdi 
there has been specific inquiry as to the industry s role in providing assistance to individuals with their applications for ssdi

also  legislation prohibiting the offset of ssdi payments against private disability insurance payments for prospectively issued policies was introduced but not enacted in the connecticut state legislature 
the company is also involved in related pending litigation 
if the industry is forced to change its offset ssdi procedures  the practices and products for the company s disability and life segment could be significantly impacted

table of contents capital resources the company s capital resources primarily retained earnings and the proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
management  guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines  determines the amount of capital resources that the company maintains 
management allocates resources to new long term business commitments when returns  considering the risks  look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate 
the company prioritizes its use of capital resources to provide capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries  consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous  and return capital to investors through share repurchase 
the availability of capital resources will be impacted by equity and credit market conditions 
extreme volatility in credit or equity market conditions may reduce the company s ability to issue debt or equity securities 
significant volatility and deterioration of the equity markets during resulted in reduced retained earnings and the capital available for growth  acquisitions  and share repurchase

these notes will mature on march  the company may redeem these notes  at any time  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to the greater of of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  or the present value of the remaining principal and interest payments on the notes being redeemed discounted at the applicable treasury rate plus basis points notes due or basis points notes due 
on march   the company entered into a commercial paper program the program 
under the program  the company is authorized to sell from time to time short term unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum of million 
the proceeds are used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases 
the company uses the credit facility described below as back up liquidity to support the outstanding commercial paper 
if at any time funds are not available on favorable terms under the program  the company may use the credit agreement see below for funding 
in october  the company added an additional dealer to its program 
as of december   the company had million in commercial paper outstanding  at a weighted average interest rate of and remaining maturities ranging from to days 
in june  the company amended and restated its five year committed revolving credit and letter of credit agreement for billion  which permits up to billion to be used for letters of credit 
this agreement is diversified among banks  with three banks each having of the commitment and the other banks having the remaining of the commitment 
the credit agreement includes options  which are subject to consent by the administrative agent and the committing banks  to increase the commitment amount up to billion and to extend the term of the agreement

there are no scheduled long term debt repayments in the company expects to either repay the commercial paper or refinance it either by issuing long term debt or re issuing commercial paper 
the company funds its qualified pension plans at least at the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the pension protection act of for  the company expects minimum required contributions to be approximately million 
this amount could change based on final valuation amounts 
in addition  the company currently plans to make voluntary contributions of approximately million during based on its current funded status  the company does not believe that the litigation matter discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements would have an impact on funding requirements even if resolved in future years contributions will ultimately be based on a wide range of factors including but not limited to asset returns  discount rates  and funding targets 
the availability of resources at the parent company level is partially dependent on dividends from the company s subsidiaries  most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions and rating agency capital guidelines  and partially dependent on the availability of liquidity from the issuance of debt or equity securities 
the company expects  based on current projections for cash activity  to have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations 
however  the company s cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings  regulatory restrictions or rating agency capital guidelines reduce the amount of dividends available to be distributed to the parent company from the insurance and hmo subsidiaries including the impact of equity market deterioration and volatility on subsidiary capital  significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets reduces the company s ability to raise capital or creates unexpected losses related to the gmdb and gmib businesses  a substantial increase in funding over current projections is required for the company s pension plan  or a substantial increase in funding is required for the company s gmdb equity hedge program 

table of contents in those cases  the company expects to have the flexibility to satisfy liquidity needs through a variety of measures  including intercompany borrowings and sales of liquid investments 
the parent company may borrow up to million from cglic without prior state approval 
in addition  the company may use short term borrowings  such as the commercial paper program and the committed line of credit agreement of up to billion subject to the maximum debt leverage covenant in its line of credit agreement 
as of december   the company had an additional billion of borrowing capacity within the maximum debt leverage covenant in the line of credit agreement in addition to the billion of debt outstanding 
though the company believes it has adequate sources of liquidity  significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect the company s ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds 
solvency regulation 
many states have adopted some form of the national association of insurance commissioners naic model solvency related laws and risk based capital rules rbc rules for life and health insurance companies 
the rbc rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held  the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred 
if the ratio of the insurer s adjusted surplus to its risk based capital falls below statutory required minimums  the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship 
in addition  various non us jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency  liquidity and reserve coverage measures 
during  the company s hmos and life and health insurance subsidiaries  as well as non us insurance subsidiaries  were compliant with applicable rbc and non us surplus rules 
effective december  the company s principal life insurance subsidiary  cglic  implemented the naic s actuarial guideline xliii also known as ag or vacarvm  which is applicable to cglic s statutory reserves for gmdb and gmib contracts totaling billion as of december  as provided under this guidance  cglic received approval from the state of connecticut to grade in the full effect of the guideline over a year period 
accordingly  upon implementation at december   statutory surplus for cglic was reduced by million 
if the guidance had been fully implemented at december   statutory surplus would have been reduced by million 
management does not anticipate that this implementation will have a material impact on the amount of dividends expected to be paid by cglic to the parent company in this implementation has no impact on measurement of the company s results of operations or financial condition as determined under gaap 
guarantees and contractual obligations the company is contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business

table of contents on balance sheet insurance liabilities 
contractual cash obligations for insurance liabilities  excluding unearned premiums and fees  represent estimated net benefit payments for health  life and disability insurance policies and annuity contracts 
recorded contractholder deposit funds reflect current fund balances primarily from universal life customers 
contractual cash obligations for these universal life contracts are estimated by projecting future payments using assumptions for lapse  withdrawal and mortality 
these projected future payments include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees 
actual obligations in any single year will vary based on actual morbidity  mortality  lapse  withdrawal  investment and premium experience 
the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of billion recorded on the balance sheet because the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting  charges and fees 
the company manages its investment portfolios to generate cash flows needed to satisfy contractual obligations 
any shortfall from expected investment yields could result in increases to recorded reserves and adversely impact results of operations 
the amounts associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses are excluded from the table above as net cash flows associated with them are not expected to impact the company 
the total amount of these reinsured reserves excluded is approximately billion 
short term debt represents commercial paper and current obligations under capital leases 
long term debt includes scheduled interest payments 
capital leases are included in long term debt and represent obligations for software licenses 
nonrecourse obligations represent principal and interest payments due which may be limited to the value of specified assets  such as real estate properties held directly or in joint ventures

this table includes estimated payments for gmib contracts  pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations  supplemental and deferred compensation plans  interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts  and certain tax and reinsurance liabilities 
estimated payments of million for deferred compensation  non qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year 
the company s best estimate is that contributions to the qualified domestic pension plan during will be approximately million 
the company expects to make payments subsequent to for these obligations  however subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions which may materially differ from actual activities see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the above table also does not contain million of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions because the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of their resolution with the respective taxing authorities

share repurchase the company maintains a share repurchase program  which was authorized by its board of directors 
the decision to repurchase shares depends on market conditions and alternative uses of capital 
the company has  and may continue from time to time  to repurchase shares on the open market through a rule b plan which permits a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods 
the company did not repurchase any shares in in the company repurchased million shares for million 
the total remaining share repurchase authorization as of february   was million 
investment assets the company s investment assets do not include separate account assets 
additional information regarding the company s investment assets and related accounting policies is included in notes    and to the consolidated financial statements 
fixed maturities investments in fixed maturities bonds include publicly traded and privately placed debt securities  mortgage and other asset backed securities  preferred stocks redeemable by the investor and trading securities 
fixed maturities and equity securities include hybrid securities 
fair values are based on quoted market prices when available 
when market prices are not available  fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  incorporating current market inputs for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality 
in instances where there is little or no market activity for the same or similar instruments  the company estimates fair value using methods  models and assumptions that the company believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price 
the company performs ongoing analyses on prices to conclude that they represent reasonable estimates of fair value 
this process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by the company s investment professionals 
this process also includes review of pricing methodologies  pricing statistics and trends and back testing recent trades 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio continues to be diversified by issuer and industry type  with no single industry constituting more than of total invested assets as of december

quality ratings as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturities in the company s investment portfolio were investment grade baa and above  or equivalent  and the remaining billion were below investment grade 
most of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non investment grade spectrum 
private placement investments are generally less marketable than publicly traded bonds  but yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly traded bonds with comparable credit risk 
the fair value of private placement investments was billion as of december  and billion as of december  the company maintains controls on its participation in private placement investments 
in particular  the company performs a credit analysis of each issuer  diversifies investments by industry and issuer and requires financial and other covenants that allow the company to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength so the company can take remedial actions  if warranted 
because of the higher yields and the inherent risk associated with privately placed investments and below investment grade securities  gains or losses from such investments could affect future results of operations 
however  since management matches the duration of assets to the duration of liabilities  it expects to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term and therefore  does not expect such gains or losses to be material to the company s liquidity or financial condition 
the value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio increased million in driven by a decline in market yields 
although asset values have improved significantly  there are securities with amortized cost in excess of fair value by million as of december  as of december   approximately or  million of the company s total investments in state and local government securities of  million were guaranteed by monoline bond insurers

commercial mortgage loans the company s commercial mortgage loans are made exclusively to commercial borrowers 
these fixed rate loans are diversified by property type  location and borrower to reduce exposure to potential losses 
loans are secured by the related property and are generally made at less than of the property s value at origination of the loan 
in addition to property value  the company evaluates the quality of each commercial mortgage loan using debt service coverage  which is the ratio of the estimated cash flows from the property to the required loan payments principal and interest 
the company completed its annual in depth review of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio in the third quarter of this review included an analysis of each property s financial statements as of december   rent rolls and operating plans and budgets for  a physical inspection of the property and other pertinent factors 
based on each property s value determined during this review  the portfolio s average loan to value ratio increased from as of december  to at december   driven by an average decline in property values of since completion of the previous review during the third quarter of this decrease is less than reported declines in commercial real estate values of to from peak prices achieved in late and into early to real estate values estimated during the second quarter of this was driven by management s decision to not fully reflect peak prices in prior valuations  along with declines in value recognized during the company s portfolio review 
in  overall debt service coverage for the portfolio of commercial mortgage loans was approximately  which was unchanged since the portfolio review 

table of contents the following table reflects the commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of december  summarized by loan to value ratio based on the annual loan review completed in july  loan to value distribution amortized cost loan to value ratios senior subordinated total of mortgage loans below to to to to to or above totals as summarized above  million or of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is comprised of subordinated notes and loans  including million of loans secured by first mortgages  which were fully underwritten and originated by the company using its standard underwriting procedures 
senior interests in these first mortgage loans were then sold to other institutional investors 
this strategy allowed the company to effectively utilize its origination capabilities to underwrite high quality loans with strong borrower sponsorship  limit individual loan exposures  and achieve attractive risk adjusted yields 
in the event of a default  the company would pursue remedies up to and including foreclosure jointly with the holders of the senior interests  but would receive repayment only after satisfaction of the senior interest 
there are seven loans where the aggregate carrying value of the mortgage loans exceeds the value of the underlying properties by million 
five of these loans have current debt service coverage of or greater and two with debt service coverage below have other mitigating factors including strong borrower sponsorship 
although the property value declines increased the portfolio loan to value ratios  all but four of the approximately loans that comprise the company s total mortgage loan portfolio continue to perform under their contractual terms  and the actual aggregate default rate is 
given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate  positive debt service coverage  significant borrower cash investment averaging nearly  and only million of loans maturing in the next twelve months  the company remains confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as required 
commercial real estate fundamentals and values continued to decline in after completion of the portfolio review in the third quarter 
while the vast majority of loans in the company s portfolio have positive debt service coverage of at least  the company expects declines in debt service coverage to reflect further deterioration in fundamentals higher vacancy rates and lower rental rates resulting from ongoing weak economic conditions 
management s current view is that property values have fallen by approximately on average from values estimated as part of the third quarter portfolio review 
however  the value of well located  well leased  institutional quality real estate appears to be stabilizing 
see critical accounting estimates beginning on page of this form k for more information on the effect of declines in property values on commercial mortgage loans 
other long term investments the company s other long term investments include million in private equity and real estate funds as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures 
the funds typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies and equity real estate 
because these investments have a subordinate position in the capital structure  the company assumes a higher level of risk for higher expected returns 
many of these entities have experienced a decline in value over the last several quarters due to economic weakness and the disruption in the capital markets 
to mitigate risk  these investments are diversified across approximately separate partnerships  and approximately general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships 
also  the funds underlying investments are diversified by industry sector  property type  and geographic region 
no single partnership investment exceeds of the company s private equity and real estate partnership portfolio 
given the current economic environment  future impairments are possible  however  management does not expect those losses to have a material effect on the company s financial condition 

table of contents problem and potential problem investments problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by days or more or have been restructured as to terms interest rate or maturity date 
potential problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current no payment more than days past due  but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems 
the characteristics management considers include  but are not limited to  the following request from the borrower for restructuring  principal or interest payments past due by more than but fewer than days  downgrade in credit rating  collateral losses on asset backed securities  and for commercial mortgages  deterioration of debt service coverage below or value declines resulting in estimated loan to value ratios increasing to or more 
the company recognizes interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment 
the amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with the original terms was not significant for or the following table shows problem and potential problem investments at amortized cost  net of valuation reserves and write downs december  december  in millions gross reserve net gross reserve net problem bonds problem commercial mortgage loans foreclosed real estate total problem investments potential problem bonds potential problem commercial mortgage loans total potential problem investments net problem investments represent of total investments excluding policy loans 
net problem investments increased million during primarily reflecting deterioration on six commercial mortgage loans totaling million  one of which is held as foreclosed real estate 
net potential problem investments represent of total investments excluding policy loans 
net potential problem investments increased million during primarily reflecting the addition of nine loans totaling million to the potential problem loan list that were exhibiting signs of distress such as an elevated loan to value ratio or a low or negative debt service coverage 
these loans were all performing according to their original contractual terms as of december  and although they are showing signs of distress  most of these loans are adequately collateralized 
these additional nine loans were added to potential problem investments as a result of management s in depth commercial mortgage loan portfolio review completed in the third quarter of 
table of contents commercial mortgage loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not collect amounts due according to the terms of the original loan agreement 
problem and potential problem commercial mortgage loans totaling million  presented in the above table  are considered impaired 
during  the company recorded a million pre tax million after tax increase to valuation reserves on impaired commercial mortgage loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of this form k for additional information regarding impaired commercial mortgage loans 
summary the company recorded after tax realized investment losses for investment asset write downs and changes in valuation reserves as follows in millions credit related other total credit related losses include other than temporary declines in value of fixed maturities and equity securities  and impairments of commercial mortgage loans and real estate entities 
the amount related to credit losses on fixed maturities for which a portion of the impairment was recognized in other comprehensive income was not significant 
prior to adoption of new gaap guidance for other than temporary impairments on april   other primarily represented the impact of rising market yields on investments where the company could not demonstrate the intent and ability to hold until recovery 
includes other than temporary impairments on debt securities of million in  million in and million in these impairments are included in both the credit related and other categories above 
the financial markets experienced a significant improvement during both investment grade and below investment grade corporate credit indices reported significantly lower credit spreads and the s p posted a return of approximately during this period 
while credit spreads tightened in and asset values increased significantly  substantial uncertainty remains concerning the economic environment 
as a result of this economic environment  risks in the company s investment portfolio remain elevated 
continued economic weakness for an extended period could cause default rates to increase and recoveries to decline resulting in additional impairment losses for the company 
future realized and unrealized investment results will be impacted largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date 
these future conditions are not reasonably predictable 
management believes that the vast majority of the company s fixed maturity investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms  and that declines in their fair values below carrying value are temporary 
based on the strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities  the company expects to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term 
therefore  future credit related losses are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity or financial condition 
while management believes the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is positioned to perform well due to the solid aggregate loan to value ratio  strong debt service coverage and minimal underwater position  the commercial real estate market continues to exhibit significant signs of distress and if these conditions remain for an extended period or worsen substantially  it could result in an increase in problem and potential problem loans 
given the current economic environment  future impairments are possible  however  management does not expect those losses to have a material effect on the company s financial condition 

table of contents market risk financial instruments the company s assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed rate  domestic  medium term instruments 
changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return and impact the value of liabilities for reinsured gmdb and gmib contracts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the south korean won  taiwan dollar  euro  british pound  new zealand dollar  and hong kong dollar 
an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
equity price risk for domestic equity securities and for the value of reinsured gmdb and gmib contracts resulting from unfavorable changes in variable annuity account values based on underlying mutual fund investments 
for further discussion of reinsured contracts  see note for gmdb contracts and note for gmib contracts in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management of market risks the company predominantly relies on three techniques to manage its exposure to market risk investment liability matching 
the company generally selects investment assets with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of its related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that the company can match the investments to its obligations 
shorter term investments support generally shorter term life and health liabilities 
medium term  fixed rate investments support interest sensitive and health liabilities 
longer term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long term disability liabilities 
use of local currencies for foreign operations 
the company generally conducts its international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies 
while this technique does not reduce the company s foreign currency exposure of its net assets  it substantially limits exchange rate risk to those net assets 
use of derivatives 
the company generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks and  from time to time  to enhance investment returns 
see notes c and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments 
effect of market fluctuations on the company the examples that follow illustrate the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including hypothetical changes in market interest rates  primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans  partially offset by liabilities for long term debt and gmib contracts  hypothetical changes in market rates for foreign currencies  primarily for the net assets of foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency  and hypothetical changes in market prices for equity exposures  primarily for equity securities and gmib contracts 
in addition  hypothetical effects of changes in equity indices and foreign exchange rates are presented separately for futures contracts used in the gmdb equity hedge program 

table of contents management believes that actual results could differ materially from these examples because these examples were developed using estimates and assumptions  changes in the fair values of all insurance related assets and liabilities have been excluded because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk  changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets have been excluded  consistent with the disclosure guidance  and changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill  deferred policy acquisition costs  taxes  and various accrued liabilities have been excluded  because they are not financial instruments  their primary risks are other than market risk 
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of the company s financial instruments  subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities  would have been as follows as of december market scenario for certain non insurance loss in fair value financial instruments in millions basis point increase in interest rates strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies decrease in market prices for equity exposures the company s foreign operations hold investment assets  such as fixed maturities  that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities 
due to the increase in the fair value of these investments in  which are primarily denominated in the south korean won  the effect of a hypothetical strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies at december  was greater than that effect at december  the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling and  for gmib contracts  stochastic modeling 
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies held by the company was estimated to be of the us dollar equivalent fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of equity exposures was estimated based on a decrease in the equity mutual fund values underlying guaranteed minimum income benefits reinsured by the company and a decrease in the value of equity securities held by the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company uses futures contracts as part of a gmdb equity hedge program to substantially reduce the effect of equity market changes on certain reinsurance contracts that guarantee minimum death benefits based on unfavorable changes in underlying variable annuity account values 
the hypothetical effect of a increase in the s p  s p  russell  nasdaq  topix japanese  eurostoxx and ftse british equity indices and a weakening in the us dollar to the japanese yen  british pound and euro would have been a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of the futures contracts outstanding under this program as of december  a corresponding decrease in liabilities for gmdb contracts would result from the hypothetical increase in these equity indices and weakening in the us dollar 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this program and related gmdb contracts 
as noted above  the company manages its exposures to market risk by matching investment characteristics to its obligations 
stock market performance the performance of equity markets can have a significant effect on the company s businesses  including on risks and exposures associated with gmdb see note to the consolidated financial statements and gmib contracts see note to the consolidated financial statements  and pension liabilities since equity securities comprise a significant portion of the assets of the company s employee pension plans
