item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
background cpsi was founded in and specializes in delivering comprehensive healthcare information systems and related services to community hospitals 
our systems and services are designed to support the primary functional areas of a hospital and to enhance access to needed financial and clinical information 
our comprehensive system enables healthcare providers to improve clinical  financial and administrative outcomes 
our products and services provide solutions in key areas  including patient management  financial management  patient care and clinical  enterprise and office automation 
in addition to servicing small to medium sized hospitals  we provide information technology services to other related entities in the healthcare industry  such as nursing homes  home health agencies and physician clinics 
we sell a fully integrated  enterprise wide financial and clinical hospital information system comprised of all necessary software  hardware  peripherals  forms and office supplies  together with comprehensive customer service and support 
we also offer business management services  including electronic billing submissions  patient statement processing and accounts receivable management  as part of our overall information system solution 
we believe that as our customer base grows  the demand for our business management services will also continue to grow  supporting further increases in recurring revenues 
our system currently is installed and operating in over hospitals in states and the district of columbia 
our customers consist of community hospitals with or fewer acute care beds  with hospitals having or fewer acute care beds comprising approximately of our customers 
management overview we primarily seek revenue growth through sales of healthcare information technology systems and related services to existing and new customers within our historic target market 
our strategy has produced consistent revenue growth over the long term  as reflected in five and ten year compounded annual growth rates in revenues of approximately and  respectively 
selling new and additional products and services back into our existing customer base is an important part of cpsi s future revenue growth 
we believe that as our customer base grows  the demand for additional products and services  including business management services  will also continue to grow  supporting further increases in recurring revenues 
we also expect to drive revenue growth from new product development that we may generate from our research and development activities 
in addition to revenue growth  our business model is focused on earnings growth 
once a hospital has installed our system  we continue to provide support and maintenance services to our customers on an ongoing basis 
these services are typically provided by the same personnel who perform our system installations but at a reduced cost to us  and therefore at an increased gross margin 
we also look to increase margins through cost containment measures where appropriate 
during the current economic recession and credit crisis  hospitals have experienced reduced availability of third party credit and an overall reduction in their investment portfolios 
in addition  healthcare organizations with a large dependency on medicaid populations  such as community based hospitals  have been impacted by the challenging financial condition of many state governments and government programs 
accordingly  we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements recognize that prospective hospital customers often do not have the necessary capital to make investments in information technology 
additionally  in response to these challenges  hospitals have become more selective regarding where they invest capital  resulting in a focus on strategic spending that generates a return on their investment 
despite the current economic environment  we believe healthcare information technology is often viewed as more strategic to hospitals than other possible purchases because the technology offers the possibility of a quick return on investment 
information technology also plays an important role in healthcare by improving safety  efficiency and reducing cost 
additionally  we believe most hospitals recognize that they must invest in healthcare information technology to meet current and future regulatory  compliance and government reimbursement requirements 
we have experienced an increase in customers seeking financing arrangements from us over the past two years for system installations as a result of current economic conditions and disruptions in credit markets 
historically  we have made financing arrangements available to customers on a case by case basis depending upon various aspects of the proposed contract and customer attributes 
these financing arrangements include short term payment plans  longer term lease financing through us and our facilitating third party financing arrangements 
we intend to continue to work with prospective customers to provide for financing arrangements to purchase our systems so long as such arrangements do not adversely affect our financial position and liquidity 
we believe that meeting the financial needs of community based hospitals while allowing for the profitable expansion of our footprint in this market will remain both an opportunity and a challenge for us in the foreseeable future 
despite the current economic recession  including the credit crisis  we have not experienced a considerable decline in demand for our products and services 
we have experienced some slowing of customer payments as well as an increase in customer defaults during  and expect this trend to continue at least through and until the economy shows significant signs of recovery 
american recovery and reinvestment act of while the current economic recession and credit crisis has impacted and could continue to impact the community hospitals that comprise our target market  we believe that the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra  which became law on february   may increase demand for healthcare information technology and may have a positive impact on our business prospects 
the arra includes more than billion in funding to aid healthcare organizations in modernizing their operations through the acquisition and wide spread use of healthcare information technology 
included in the funding is approximately billion in incentives through medicare and medicaid reimbursement systems to encourage and assist healthcare providers in adopting and using electronic health records ehrs 
these incentive payments are set to begin as early as and last through if an eligible healthcare provider does not begin to demonstrate meaningful use of ehrs by  then reimbursement under medicare will begin to be reduced 
while many elements of the arra are still unclear or undefined  we are focused on ensuring that we take the necessary steps now to meet the needs of community hospitals to help them gain access to those incentives 
primary among those steps is ensuring that our technology meets the arra s ehr certification requirements 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued a proposal in january of detailing guidelines for determining which doctors offices and hospitals will be eligible to receive funds under the arra  and the proposal is currently open to public comment  but it did not reveal which electronic medical record providers will be certified under the program or explain how those providers will be certified 
in this regard  we created our new product development division early in to help ensure that our technology remains on the leading edge of the development curve and can react quickly and effectively to any technical requirements that arise under the arra 
we also hired over new employees in so that we have a sufficient number of adequately trained and technically proficient support staff in place when our existing customers and any prospective hospital customers proceed to implement ehrs 
while we have not experienced and do not expect an immediate increase in revenue from the healthcare information technology provisions of the arra  we believe that the longer term potential could be significant 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the arra is expected to provide states with badly needed medicaid dollars  which should help improve the financial health of hospitals and incentivize them to make investments in information technology 
additionally  we expect that community hospitals  which rely more heavily on medicare and medicaid to fund their operations than larger hospitals  will be seeking to invest in any information technology applications that will increase their medicare and medicaid funding 
we believe that our footprint among community hospitals positions us well to benefit from these incentives 
healthcare reform the us congress is currently pursuing various legislative proposals for the reform of the us healthcare and health insurance industries 
it is still too early for us to determine whether and to what extent this may effect the healthcare information technology industry as well as our current and any potential future customers 
financial overview our gross revenues in increased from  while our net income decreased 
cash flow from operations decreased from due to an increase in accounts and financing receivables during the year  as well as a change in cash flow presentation regarding inventory used in internal operations 
we have experienced an increase in customers seeking financing arrangements for system installation during due to current economic conditions and unavailability of third party credit 
we will grant financing arrangements to customers on a case by case basis depending upon various aspects of the proposed contract and customer attributes 
while our operating cash flows declined during  we maintained a strong cash position that we believe is sufficient to meet our operating requirements 
we believe that a strong cash position enables us to compete better in the marketplace and maintain the quality of our customer service and product offerings

critical accounting policies general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make some estimates and judgments that affect the preparation of these financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  but actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the accounting principles required by the software topic and revenue recognition subtopic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification the codification and those prescribed by the sec 
these standards require that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the company expects to collect and do not bear interest 
the collectibility of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
if it is determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  a specific reserve for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered 
estimates 
the company uses estimates to record certain transactions and liabilities 
these estimates are generally based on managements best judgement  past experience  and utilization of third party services such as actuarial and other expert services 
because these estimates are subjective and variable  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
significant estimates included in our financial statements include those for self insurance reserves under our health insurance plan  reserves for uncertain tax positions  bad debt allowances and legal liability exposure or lack thereof 
backlog backlog consists of revenues we reasonably expect to recognize over the next twelve months under existing contracts 
the revenues to be recognized may relate to a combination of one time fees for system sales  and recurring fees for support  business management  asp and isp services 
as of december   we had a twelve month backlog of approximately million in connection with non recurring system purchases and approximately million in connection with recurring payments under support  business management  asp and isp contracts 

table of contents 
index to financial statements quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market and interest rate risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to the potential change in the value of our investment portfolio as a result of fluctuations in interest rates 
the primary purpose of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted of a variety of financial instruments  including  but not limited to  money market securities and high quality government and corporate obligations 
it is our intent to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the securities in our investment portfolio are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our balance sheet as a current asset at fair market value with their unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
due to the conservative allocation of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially effected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks
