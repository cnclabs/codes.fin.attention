item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview seacor and its subsidiaries are in the business of owning  operating  investing in and marketing equipment  primarily in the offshore oil and gas  industrial aviation and marine transportation industries 
the company conducts its activities in six primary business segments offshore marine services operates a diversified fleet of offshore support vessels primarily servicing offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production facilities worldwide 
marine transportation services operates a fleet of us flag product tankers carrying petroleum  crude oil and chemical products in the us coastwise trade 
inland river services is primarily engaged in dry and liquid cargo transportation on the us inland river waterways and the gulf intracoastal waterways for a range of agricultural and industrial products 
aviation services operates and leases helicopters that provide transportation services supporting offshore oil and gas activities primarily in the united states  air medical services to hospitals in the united states and industrial aviation services in south america  europe  india and asia 
environmental services is primarily engaged in the provision of emergency preparedness and response services to oil  chemical  industrial and marine transportation clients in the united states and abroad 
commodity trading and logistics is an integrated business involved in the purchase  storage  transportation and sale of agricultural and energy commodities 
other primarily includes harbor and offshore towing services  various other investments in joint ventures and lending and leasing activities 
the company s business segments  with the exception of environmental services and commodity trading and logistics  are asset related and highly capital intensive 
demand for the company s assets is cyclical in varying degrees due to fluctuations in the activity levels in the industries serviced by those assets  as well as availability of supply 
to manage capital successfully over time  the company continually assesses its asset portfolio and pursues opportunities to realize value from its assets by shifting their operation to other markets or trading them when circumstances warrant 
the company actively leases out and leases in  and buys and sells equipment in the ordinary course of its business 
it also designs  orders  builds  upgrades  operates or re sells newly constructed equipment 
the company typically pursues a strategy of shedding older assets while adjusting its asset mix 
the company also leases assets to other operators and sells assets to financial lessors and leases them back for varying periods of time 
the company believes that maintaining significant liquidity is an important factor that will enable it to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
in recent years  the company has sought to create balance in its businesses and broaden its asset base by investing in barges  ships and tugs  and by looking for opportunities to engage in logistics support for movement of agricultural and energy commodities 
the company is exploring opportunities to extend its aviation activities through investments in sales  marketing and distribution of aircraft and specialized parts and services  maintenance and repair facilities and fixed base operations 
in addition  the company is also looking to expand into the chinese and indian markets 

table of contents the company believes that demand for its barges  tankers and tugs is  in part  linked to different factors than those that drive demand for offshore oil and gas exploration and development 
in addition  for barges and tankers  contracts can sometimes be secured with longer terms than those typically available for offshore marine and helicopter services 
the expectation is that over time this strategy of diversification will provide better returns on capital than could be achieved by restricting investment to one specific  highly cyclical  asset class such as marine vessels supporting offshore oil and gas activity 
the company believes this strategy will afford more opportunities to use capital efficiently  create greater stability of earnings and allow improved margins due to operational synergies that in turn  should yield a lower cost of capital  more sustainable cash flows and increased profitability 
consolidated results of operations consolidated financial data for segment and geographic areas is reported in part iv note major customers and segment data of this annual report on form k 
offshore marine services the market for offshore oil and gas drilling has historically been cyclical 
demand tends to be linked to the price of oil and gas and those prices tend to fluctuate depending on many factors  including global economic activity and levels of inventory 
price levels for oil and gas can in themselves cause additional fluctuations by inducing changes in consumer behavior 
the cyclicality of the market is further exacerbated by the tendency in the industry to order capital assets as demand grows  often resulting in new capacity becoming available just as demand for oil and gas is peaking and activity is about to decline 
the precipitous drop in oil and gas prices during the second half of reduced offshore activity to some degree and this continued during the company responded to these market conditions by cold stacking a number of vessels previously operating in the us gulf of mexico 
as of december   the company had vessels cold stacked 
the term cold stacked means unmanned and not working 
the company continues to monitor market conditions and will cold stack additional vessels  or place vessels back into service  as it deems appropriate 
the domestic order book is smaller than the international order book  but there continues to be over capacity in the us market 
in addition  deliveries of newly built vessels into the international market  in conjunction with reduced demand  has created a situation of oversupply in the north sea  asia  middle east and west africa regions 
this situation is likely to worsen during as more newly built vessels are delivered  even if some orders are cancelled or vessel deliveries are delayed 
reduced activity  combined with tighter capital and credit markets  has created uncertainty over new construction of offshore equipment 
the order book for new equipment remains large but there are uncertainties as to if and when these assets will be delivered 
many of these assets were ordered without firm contractual commitments for employment and should these assets be delivered and placed into service there could be an adverse impact on market conditions 
over the last several years  offshore marine services has disposed of its old generation equipment while taking delivery of new vessels specifically designed to meet the changing requirements of the market 
since december   the average age of the fleet  excluding standby safety vessels  has been reduced from years to years 
offshore marine services enters with a limited order book for new equipment and believes its diverse fleet and broad geographical distribution of vessels will assist in weathering the effects of the industry downturn 
the company s strong financial position should enable offshore marine services to capitalize on opportunities as they develop for purchasing  mobilizing or upgrading vessels to meet changing market conditions 
as of december   offshore marine services had three fast support vessels under construction in the us gulf of mexico 

table of contents the number and type of vessels operated  their rates per day worked and their utilization levels are the key determinants of offshore marine services operating results and cash flows 
unless a vessel is cold stacked removed from operational service  there is little reduction in daily running costs and  consequently  operating margins are most sensitive to changes in rates per day worked and utilization 
the aggregate cost of offshore marine services operations depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
offshore marine services costs and expenses include daily running costs and fixed costs 
daily running costs are primarily comprised of wages paid to marine personnel  maintenance and repairs and insurance  which vary depending on equipment type  location and activity 
the most significant components of maintenance and repair expenses are drydock and main engine overhaul costs  which are expensed as incurred 
vessel drydockings are regularly performed in accordance with applicable regulations and main engine overhauls are performed in accordance with a planned maintenance program 
if a disproportionately large number of drydockings or overhauls are undertaken in a particular fiscal year or calendar quarter  operating expenses may vary significantly when compared with the prior year or quarter

during and  orders placed for the construction of new double hulled vessels qualified for operation in the us coastwise trade created uncertainty as to whether the market would be able to absorb such additional capacity 
in response to the uncertainty of both demand and supply factors and in order to secure a portion of the fleet s future earnings  
table of contents marine transportation services entered into a firm nine year arrangement to bareboat charter out four vessels with staggered delivery dates 
the first vessel began its charter in march  the second in september  the third in january and the fourth is due to commence its charter in the third quarter of as of december   the company believes third parties had contracted to build approximately us flag tank vessels that could compete with marine transportation services equipment 
fifteen vessels are scheduled to be delivered in  three vessels in  and the remaining two in or it is anticipated that retirements of us flag tank vessels under opa regulations will be one in  four in and another twelve between and january  the following table presents  for the years indicated  the percentage of revenues marine transportation services earned from its charter arrangements 
time charters bareboat charters contracts of affreightment and voyage contracts marine transportation services costs and expenses include daily running costs and fixed costs 
daily running costs are primarily comprised of wages paid to marine personnel  maintenance and repairs and insurance  which vary depending on equipment type  location and activity 
the most significant components of maintenance and repair expenses are drydocking costs  which are expensed as incurred 
vessel drydockings are regularly performed in accordance with applicable regulations and if a disproportionately large number of drydockings are undertaken in a particular fiscal year or calendar quarter  operating expenses may vary significantly when compared with a prior year or quarter 
depreciation is marine transportation services principal fixed cost 
depreciation depends on the acquisition costs of vessels and their related useful life and salvage value assumptions 
the company believes the seabulk america is one of six vessels designed and certified to carry complicated chemical cargos in the domestic coastwise trade 
given the overriding effects of the global economic slowdown  demand for the vessel s specialized services was soft during the company believes the chemical industry is undergoing a cyclical market down turn that will gradually recover  however  the seabulk america requires a regulatory dry docking during the third quarter of  a requirement for continued operation 
a decision as to whether or not this expenditure should be incurred will be made against the then prevailing market conditions 
a decision to cease vessel operations and lay up the seabulk america amid continued weak market conditions could potentially result in a significant impairment charge 
the carrying value of the seabulk america was million as of december   with contributed operating revenues of million during the year ended december

inland river services for the inland river industry  can best be summed up as a year that started and finished strongly but struggled in the middle 
it was a year which  at its worst  saw of the available barge fleet idled with spot freight rates falling to below breakeven levels 
historically  activity levels for grain exports and non grain imports are the key drivers in determining freight rates 
when these activity levels are low  the barge industry must deal with an oversupply of equipment  inevitably leading to pressure on rates 
during  although grain export activity was positively impacted by an unprecedented demand for soybeans  principally destined for china  the market was dominated by weaker corn exports and a significant reduction in the level of coal exports compared with imports were seriously impacted by the ongoing economic recession in the united states with reduced demand for construction related materials and other industrial cargos 
the combination of these factors contributed to an oversupply of equipment and a market in which freight rates struggled to maintain reasonable values for much of the year 
barge operators responded to these difficult market conditions by idling equipment in an effort to support the rate structure 
weather issues also plagued the industry during an unusually wet spring caused navigation problems that hindered barge operations and delayed the planting of crops 
then  in september  the rains returned as farmers were preparing to harvest 
despite the late rains and thousands of lost acres  the latest production estimates for the season according to the us department of agriculture  point to a record corn crop and one of the best soybean crops on record 
as a result  harvest activity was compressed during the fourth quarter and the requirement to move a large crop in a shorter period brought previously idled equipment back into service as demand improved and freight rates moved higher 
at the end of  the average age of the inland river services dry cargo barge fleet was six years old  which the company believes is among the youngest fleets operating on the us inland river waterways system 
inland river services believes that approximately of the dry cargo barge fleet operating on the us inland river waterways is over years old 
inland river services expects the relatively young age of its dry cargo barge fleet to enhance its availability and reliability  reduce downtime for repairs and limit replacement capital expenditures required to maintain its fleet size and revenue generating capacity 
the following table presents  for the years indicated  the percentage of revenues inland river services earned from its various operations 
dry cargo barge pool participation liquid unit tow operations charter out of dry cargo barges  barrel liquid tank barge operations inland river towboat operations and other activities inland river services manages the dry cargo barge pools in which it participates

table of contents operating income compared with operating income in included million in gains on asset dispositions compared with gains of million in excluding the impact of these gains  operating income increased by million 
operating income in the liquid unit tow operation and the sauget terminal operations were higher in line with the improvements in operating revenues noted above 
for the pooled hopper barge fleet  operating income was lower due to the reductions in operating revenues noted above combined with higher operating expenses  primarily towing  fleeting and switching costs 
operating revenues compared with operating revenues increased in  primarily due to the impact of new equipment placed into service in the liquid unit tow operation 
operating revenues were also favorably impacted by increased activity on the lower mississippi river and higher rates 
in addition  operating revenues were higher following the return of dry cargo barges to the pooled operating fleet that were previously on a long term charter to a third party 
the commencement of terminal operations in sauget  illinois also contributed to revenue growth 
operating income compared with operating income in included million in gains on asset dispositions compared with gains of million in excluding the impact of these gains  operating income decreased by million 
the improvements in operating revenues noted above were offset by higher operating expenses  primarily due to higher fuel  towing  fleeting and switching costs and higher repair and maintenance costs 
in addition  wage and benefit costs were higher as a result of additional activity in the liquid unit tow operation 
equity in earnings of or less owned companies 
equity in earnings in consist primarily of results from inland river services joint venture that owns a fleet of inland river transportation assets and enters into strategic positions in marketable securities and commodity futures 
equity in earnings include losses from trading activities and the recognition of an impairment charge on prime brokerage exposure in and include gains on marketable securities and commodity futures in as of december  and  this joint venture had no marketable security or commodity future positions 
aviation services a significant portion of aviation services operations involves transportation services provided to offshore oil and gas customers and leasing aircraft to third parties 
as with the company s offshore marine services segment  the offshore oil and gas market is highly cyclical with demand linked to the price of oil and gas which tend to fluctuate depending on many factors  including global economic activity and levels of inventory 
alaska and the us gulf of mexico represent aviation services major oil and gas markets 
demand for leased aircraft is influenced by the overall demand for aircraft and the availability of financing to potential customers 
the recent difficulties in the credit market have increased demand for aviation services leased assets 
aviation services current revenue stream from the support of oil and gas activities is balanced between the exploration and production activities of its customers 
exploration and development activities generally require medium size and heavy aircraft  which typically earn higher margins 
production related activities are less sensitive to variations in commodity prices and accordingly provide a more stable demand for services 
aviation services has concentrated its production support in deepwater areas and with pipeline companies 
it performs very little shallow water production support 
in recent years  aviation services oil company customers have been seeking modern aircraft that offer enhanced safety features and greater performance 
some customers have also been moving from small single engine aircraft to small twin engine aircraft due to the additional safety afforded from two engines when flying extended range missions in deepwater areas 
aviation services  through one of its joint ventures  offer training services to third parties using a mix of classrooms  flight training devices and aircraft 
the demand for these services has increased in line with customers efforts to improve safety 

table of contents maintenance and repair expenses  depreciation  employee compensation  insurance costs and fuel expenses represent a significant portion of aviation services overall operating costs 
all maintenance and repair costs  including aircraft refurbishments and engine and major component overhauls  are expensed as incurred 
should a disproportionate number of refurbishments or overhauls be undertaken in a particular fiscal year or calendar quarter  comparative operating expenses may vary considerably 
certain third party vendors maintain the engines and some components on some of aviation services helicopters under programs that require it to pay ratably for the service based on actual flight hours flown 
the costs are normally billed on a monthly basis and expensed as incurred 
in the event that aviation services places an aircraft in a program after a maintenance period has begun it may be necessary to pay an initial buy in charge based on hours flown to date with such charge being amortized over the contract period 
if a helicopter is sold before the scheduled maintenance work is carried out  aviation services may be able to recover part of the expenditure incurred up to that point 
the impact of entry into and exit from these programs can have a significant impact on aviation services repair and maintenance costs 
in measuring and evaluating aviation services performance  management considers flight hours flown 
hours flown were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and include hours flown for oil and gas support services  air medical services  flightseeing activities and certain leasing activities 
these hours are not necessarily indicative of management s expectations for future flight hours for the aviation services fleet

the decreases in operating revenues noted above were offset by reductions in operating expenses  including a reduction in fuel cost on non rebillable flight hours and lower wages as a result of a reduction in workforce 
operating income from leasing activities was million higher in in addition  operating income was million higher due to the receipt of insurance proceeds related to hurricane damage incurred in operating revenues compared with operating revenues increased in due to several factors 
operating revenues from international leasing activities increased by million as more aircraft were dedicated to the international leasing market 
as of december   excluding joint ventures  helicopters were operating in the international leasing market compared with as of december  in the us gulf of mexico  although flight hours decreased  operating revenues improved by million primarily due to the replacement of older equipment with newer helicopters that earned generally higher contract rates and higher utilization of the heavy helicopter fleet 
operating revenues in alaska increased by million  primarily due to a higher volume of fuel sales and higher fuel prices at the fbo and an additional oil and gas support contract 
operating revenues from air medical services improved by million due to additional contracts with hospitals 
operating income compared with operating income in included million of gains on asset dispositions compared with gains of million in excluding the impact of these gains  operating income from flight operations decreased by million 
the improvements in operating revenues noted above were offset by higher operating expenses  primarily for fuel  repairs and maintenance  expenses related to hurricane disruptions in the us gulf of mexico and higher depreciation charges as a result of net aircraft additions 
derivative gains losses  net 
aviation services has foreign currency forward contracts designated as a fair value hedges for the purchase of capital equipment 
the reported gains and losses represent the ineffective portion of these hedges 
environmental services environmental services charges fees for its consulting and industrial and remediation services on both a time and material basis and on a fixed fee bid basis 
in both cases the total fees charged are dependent upon the scope of work to be accomplished and the labor and equipment required to carry it out 
the margins on time and material services are more predictable and for the most part are larger than for fixed fee work 
the margins on equipment intensive jobs are normally higher than labor intensive jobs 
the principal components of environmental services operating expenses are salaries and related benefits for operating personnel  payments to subcontractors  equipment maintenance and depreciation 
these expenses are primarily a function of regulatory requirements and the level of retainer  spill  consulting and other environmental business activities 

table of contents during the year ended december   environmental services continued to build on its environmental and consulting base through acquisitions 
on december   the company acquired pier systems inc  a provider of crisis communication consulting services and software in the united states and abroad 
operating results and cash flows can be very dependent on the number of emergency responses in a given fiscal period  the magnitude of each emergency and the profit margin earned 
consequently  emergency response revenues and related income can vary materially between comparable periods 
the revenues from any one period are not indicative of a trend or anticipated results in future periods 
costs of emergency response activities can include payments to sub contractors for labor  equipment and materials and or the direct charge of labor  equipment and materials provided by environmental services 
profit margins vary based on the use of the company s personnel and equipment resources versus the use of third party personnel and equipment

commodity trading and logistics the profitability of commodity trading and logistics is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural and energy commodities and the availability and costs of transportation and logistics services  including truck  barge  rail and ocean freight 
commodity trading and logistics expects that population growth  rising standards of living and rising global demand for renewable fuels will continue to increase global demand for agricultural and energy commodities 
however  from time to time  imbalances may exist between capacity and demand for rice  sugar and energy related products in certain markets  which impacts whether  when and where to purchase  store  transport or sell these commodities and whether to change the location of commodity trading and logistics inventories

schoenfeld v 
seacor marine  llc  is an individual claim filed by mr 
schoenfeld  even though he himself is a member of the class described in the bailey case 
at this early stage  no definitive estimate can be made as to the probability or magnitude of exposure in the cases 
outside legal counsel s initial investigation suggests that there is a substantial legal question as to whether federal maritime law preempts the application of state law to the seacor vessels in question
