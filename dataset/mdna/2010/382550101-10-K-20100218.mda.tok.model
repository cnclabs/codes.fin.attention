item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires  with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries  including the united states 
we operate our business through four operating segments representing our regional tire businesses north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire emea  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
we experienced challenging industry conditions throughout due to recessionary economic conditions in many parts of the world during the first half of and a slow and uncertain recovery from those conditions in the second half of these industry conditions were characterized by lower motor vehicle sales and production and weakness in the demand for replacement tires  particularly in the commercial markets  compared to for the year ended december   goodyear net loss was million  compared to a goodyear net loss of million in our total segment operating income for was million  compared to million in the decline in segment operating income was due primarily to a significant increase in under absorbed fixed overhead costs and a decrease in tire volume 
see results of operations segment information for additional information 
net sales were billion in  compared to billion in net sales declined due to lower tire volume  primarily in north american tire and emea  a decrease in other tire related businesses  primarily in north american tire s third party sales of chemical products  and foreign currency translation  primarily in emea 
the impact of the global economic slowdown on our operating results was mitigated by the success of the strategic initiatives we announced in february which were aimed at strengthening our revenue  cost structure and cash flow  including continuing our focus on consumer driven product development and innovation by introducing more than new tires globally  including several branded mid tier product offerings 
during  we achieved our goal and introduced new products  such as the assurance fuel max in north america and the efficientgrip tire with fuel saving technology in europe  achieving our four point cost savings plan target of billion by increasing our continuous improvement efforts  lowering our manufacturing costs  increasing purchasing savings  eliminating non essential discretionary spending  and reducing overhead and development costs  as discussed in more detail below 
we achieved approximately million of cost savings in in association with this plan  we had personnel reductions of approximately  people in reducing manufacturing capacity by million to million units by february we have announced planned manufacturing capacity reductions of approximately million units in including the discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in amiens  france and the closing of our las pinas  philippines plant  reducing inventory levels by over million by the end of compared with we exceeded this goal and have reduced inventories by  million from december  to december   adjusting planned capital expenditures to between million and million in from  million in our capital expenditures were million in  and pursuing additional non core asset sales  including our decision to pursue offers for our european and latin american farm tire business 
we exceeded our inventory reduction goal through the combination of lower raw material costs and the implementation of an advantaged supply chain  primarily in north american tire and emea  by improving demand forecasting  increasing production flexibility through shorter lead times and reduced production lot sizes  reducing the quantity of raw materials required to meet an improved demand forecast  changing the composition of our 
table of contents logistics network by closing and consolidating certain distribution warehouses  increasing local production and reducing longer lead time off shore imports  and reducing in transit inventory between our plants and regional distribution centers 
in spite of the challenging global and industry economic conditions we experienced  we had several key achievements in as described above  we met  and frequently exceeded  our financial and operating goals announced in february in the face of the global recession  we strengthened our liquidity position due  in significant part  to strong working capital management  we successfully completed a billion senior unsecured notes offering in the second quarter that addressed a december debt maturity and further enhanced our liquidity position  we successfully addressed many of the challenges posed by the general motors and chrysler bankruptcies and did not suffer any material losses on our receivables  we completed a new four year master labor contract with the united steelworkers usw  and we continued to strengthen our leadership team 
we expect to be a year of modest recovery  with increases in demand expected to improve our capacity utilization  which in turn will result in declines in unabsorbed fixed costs in as compared to as noted below  we also expect raw material cost pressures to intensify  particularly in the second half of in order to ensure that we are positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery  we will control our cost structure by increasing low cost sourcing to more than million by the end of  pursuing cost reduction initiatives that are targeted to achieve billion of aggregate gross cost savings from to  and continuing our commitment to reduce high cost manufacturing capacity by to million units by february we expect raw material costs for the first half of to decrease about when compared to the same period of  with a first quarter decrease of approximately 
the second half of the year should reflect increases approaching as compared to the same period in four point cost savings plan in  we completed our four year  four point cost savings plan 
we achieved billion of aggregate gross cost savings from through compared with those cost reductions consisted of approximately billion of estimated savings related to continuous improvement initiatives  including business process improvements  such as six sigma and lean manufacturing  manufacturing efficiencies  product reformulations and safety programs  and ongoing savings that we achieved from our prior master labor agreement with the usw  approximately million of estimated savings from the reduction of high cost manufacturing capacity by over million units  approximately million of estimated savings related to our sourcing strategy of increasing our procurement of tires  raw materials  capital equipment and indirect materials from low cost countries  and approximately million of estimated savings from reductions in selling  administrative and general expense related to initiatives including benefit plan changes  back office and warehouse consolidations  supply chain improvements  legal entity reductions and headcount rationalizations 
we will continue to implement various cost reduction initiatives and expect to achieve billion in aggregate gross cost savings from through through our four point cost savings plan 
we will continue to focus on savings from continuous improvement initiatives  including savings under our new usw agreement described below  low cost country sourcing  high cost capacity reductions and reduced selling  administrative and general expenses 

table of contents usw collective bargaining agreement in september  members of the usw ratified a new four year master labor contract with goodyear 
the new contract enhances the competitiveness of our usw represented tire plants through improvements in productivity  wage and benefit savings and added flexibility 
these changes are expected to provide us with cost savings of approximately million over the term of the contract 
combined with savings realized through pre bargain agreements to reduce staffing levels at five us plants  we expect to realize approximately million in total savings over the term of the agreements 
pension and benefit plans during  our domestic pension fund experienced market gains  which increased plan assets by million and decreased net actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl by million 
as a result  annual domestic net periodic pension cost will decrease to approximately million to million in from million in  primarily due to expected returns on higher plan assets and amortization of lower net actuarial losses from aocl 
liquidity at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents as well as  million of unused availability under our various credit agreements  compared to  million and  million  respectively  at december  cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by improvements in trade working capital of  million and proceeds from the issuance of our billion senior notes due partially offsetting these increases in cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of million  the repayment at maturity of our million senior floating rate notes due and the million net repayment of amounts incurred under our first lien revolving credit facility due we believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs in and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment 
new products in  we successfully launched the goodyear assurance fuel max in north america 
we also announced the launch of new products in our commercial truck tire business  including two new fuel max products 
in addition  in we announced plans to begin production of a inch   pound off the road tire for applications on mining and earthmoving equipment 
at our north american dealer conference in early  we introduced several key products  most notably the goodyear assurance comfortred touring tire 
this premium tier consumer tire provides a smooth  quiet and comfortable ride primarily on passenger cars and luxury sedans 
additionally  we are adding key sizes to supplement new consumer products launched in recent years  including our award winning fuel max tires  which are certified by the epa in helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
in europe  we introduced the third generation of runonflat tire technology  offering comfort  reduced mass and rolling resistance  increased fuel economy and reduced carbon dioxide emission levels 
we also introduced our goodyear efficientgrip tire with fuel saving technology which has improved wet braking distance  while providing better mileage and rolling resistance to reduce fuel consumption 
in addition  we extended our ultra high performance dunlop sportmaxx tt and sportmaxx gt lines  and our goodyear max technology line of commercial tires 
in latin america  we launched the new eagle gt consumer tire after its successful introduction in north america 
in our commercial business  a new design of the g line was launched  offering significantly improved tread wear performance  and we introduced the series products with duralife technology throughout the region 
in asia pacific  we launched duraplus with tredlife technology  providing improved mileage  and in australia  we introduced several new consumer products including the goodyear wrangler mt r with kevlar 

table of contents industry volume estimates the industry environment remains challenging and will continue to impact our performance in our outlook for the industry for in north america is expected to be stronger as compared to  but significantly below levels 
we expect consumer replacement will improve to  as volumes continue to recover slowly 
we believe consumer oe will increase to 
commercial replacement is expected to increase to  while commercial oe  which was negatively impacted the most significantly in  is expected to increase to 
the net impact of higher volume in will have a positive impact on north american tire  however  mix pressures will increase due to the stronger anticipated recovery in oe than in replacement 
in europe  we anticipate less favorable conditions for recovery in for consumer tires  we see markets that range from flat up to a increase in replacement and range from a decrease of to an increase of in oe 
for commercial tires  we expect an increase of to in replacement and an increase of to in oe 
finally  we expect growth to continue in the emerging markets our products serve

sag in was of sales  compared to in rationalizations to maintain global competitiveness  we have implemented rationalization actions over the past several years to reduce excess and high cost manufacturing capacity and to reduce selling  administrative and general expenses through associate headcount reductions 
we recorded net rationalization charges of million in million after tax or per share 
rationalization actions in consisted of initiatives in north american tire to reduce manufacturing headcount at several facilities  including union city  tennessee  danville  virginia and topeka  kansas  to respond to lower production demand 
additional salaried headcount reductions were initiated at our corporate offices in akron  ohio  in north american tire and throughout emea 
we also initiated the discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in amiens  france and manufacturing headcount reductions at each of our two facilities in brazil 
additional rationalization charges of million related to rationalization plans announced in have not yet been recorded and are expected to be incurred and recorded during the next twelve months 
we recorded net rationalization charges of million in million after tax or per share  which consisted primarily of the closure of the somerton  australia tire manufacturing facility  the closure of the tyler  texas mix center  and our plan to exit of our underperforming retail stores in the us other rationalization actions in related to plans to reduce manufacturing  selling  administrative and general expenses through headcount reductions in all of our strategic business units 
upon completion of the plans  we estimate that annual operating costs will be reduced by approximately million million cgs and million sag

income tax expense in also included net tax benefits of million per share primarily related to a million benefit resulting from the release of a valuation allowance on our australian operations and a million benefit resulting from the settlement of our through competent authority claim between the united states and canada 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the us statutory rate was primarily due to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed above 
our losses in various taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets 
however  in certain foreign locations  it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all  or a portion  of these valuation allowances within the next months will exist  resulting in possible one time tax benefits of up to million million net of minority interest

 accounting policies for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  based on currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods 
our critical accounting policies relate to general and product liability and other litigation  workers compensation  recoverability of goodwill  deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions  and pensions and other postretirement benefits 
general and product liability and other litigation 
general and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on management s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable 
if the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the estimated loss 
if the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another  we record the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel 
court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss  which may have an impact on our reported results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer 
specifically  we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past  or in certain of our facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in federal and state courts 
we engage an independent asbestos valuation firm  bates white  llc bates  to review our existing reserves for pending asbestos claims  provide a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims  and estimate our receivables from probable insurance recoveries related to such claims 

table of contents a significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated  and that increase may be significant 
we had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims  inclusive of defense costs  totaling million at december  the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was million 
at december   we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities  net of our estimate for probable insurance recoveries  could exceed our recorded amounts by million 
we maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
we record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
this determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration relevant factors or agreements in principle  including ongoing legal proceedings with certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers  their financial viability  their legal obligations and other pertinent facts 
bates also assists us in valuing receivables to be recorded for probable insurance recoveries 
based upon the model employed by bates  as of december   i we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million  and ii we expect that approximately of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability 
the receivables recorded consist of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers 
of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts receivable at december  workers compensation 
we had recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  of million for anticipated costs related to us workers compensation claims at december  the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
we periodically  and at least annually  update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses 
the liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return

 commitments and contingent liabilities 
recoverability of goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized 
rather  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present 
goodwill totaled million at december  we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units 
there have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated 
our annual impairment testing is conducted as of july st each year and for our analysis indicated no impairment of goodwill 
for purposes of our annual testing in  we determined the estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow approach 
we believe this methodology is appropriate in the determination of fair value 
we may also use different fair value techniques when we believe a discounted cash flow approach may not provide an appropriate determination of fair value 
the discounted cash flow model of the reporting units is based on the forecasted operating cash flow for the current year  projected operating cash flows for the next nine years determined using forecasted amounts as well as an estimated growth rate and a terminal value beyond ten years 
discounted cash flows consist of the operating cash flows for each business unit less an estimate for capital expenditures 
the key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow approach include growth rates  projected segment operating income  changes in working capital  our plan for capital expenditures  anticipated funding for pensions  and a discount rate equal to our assumed long term cost of capital 
corporate administrative expenses are allocations of corporate overhead that we make to 
table of contents each strategic business unit and are excluded from the discounted cash flow model 
cash flows may be adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items 
as segment operating income was the starting point for determining operating cash flow  which excludes non recurring or unusual items  there were no other non recurring or unusual items excluded from the calculations of operating cash flow in any of the periods included in our determination of fair value 
we consider significant decreases in forecasted cash flows in future periods to be an indication of a potential impairment 
at the time of our annual impairment testing  fair value would have to decline in excess of for north american tire  over for emea and in excess of for asia pacific tire to indicate potential goodwill impairment 
the discount rate used would have to increase over five percentage points for north american tire  over four percentage points for emea and over two percentage points for asia pacific tire and the assumed growth rate would have to be negative for each of the business units to indicate a potential impairment 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions 
at december   we had a valuation allowance aggregating billion against all of our net federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets 
we assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our losses in the us and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net federal  state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
we derecognize tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods  or that we are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash  and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 income taxes 
pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions  including life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  future compensation levels  future health care costs  and maximum company covered benefit costs 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries 
assumptions about life expectancies  retirement rates  future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends  including an assumption about inflation 
the discount rate for our us plans is 
table of contents derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated aa or higher by standard poor s as of december and is reviewed annually 
the total cash flows provided by the portfolio are similar to the timing of our expected benefit payment cash flows 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our us pension fund over a period of years or more  estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation 
actual domestic pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis 
these assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate 
changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected 
the weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our us pension and other postretirement plans was and  respectively  at december   compared to for our u

results of operations segment information segment information reflects our strategic business units sbus  which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis 
results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income 
each segment exports tires to other segments 
the financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments  but include operating income derived from such transactions 
segment operating income is computed as follows net sales less cgs excluding asset write off and accelerated depreciation charges and sag including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses 
segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates 
segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges credits  asset sales and certain other items 
total segment operating income was million in  million in and billion in total segment operating margin segment operating income divided by segment sales in was  compared to in and in management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our sbus and excludes items not directly related to the sbus for performance evaluation purposes

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities 
our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital 
we experienced challenging industry conditions throughout due to recessionary economic conditions in many parts of the world during the first half of and a slow and uncertain recovery from those conditions in the second half of these industry conditions were characterized by lower motor vehicle sales and production and weakness in the demand for replacement tires  particularly in the commercial markets  compared to given the difficult economic environment and the uncertainty in the capital markets  we took several actions to strengthen our liquidity in  including strong working capital management 
we also successfully completed a billion senior unsecured notes offering in the second quarter of that addressed a december debt maturity and further enhanced our liquidity position 
the impact of the global economic slowdown on our operating results was also mitigated by the success of the strategic initiatives we announced in february which were aimed at strengthening our revenue  cost structure and cash flow  including continuing our focus on consumer driven product development and innovation by introducing more than new tires globally  including several branded mid tier product offerings 
during  we achieved our goal and introduced new products  such as the assurance fuel max in north america and the efficientgrip tire with fuel saving technology in europe  achieving our four point cost savings plan target of billion by increasing our continuous improvement efforts  lowering our manufacturing costs  increasing purchasing savings  eliminating non essential discretionary spending  and reducing overhead and development costs 
we achieved approximately million of cost savings in in association with this plan  we had personnel reductions of approximately  people in  reducing manufacturing capacity by million to million units by february we have announced planned manufacturing capacity reductions of approximately million units in including the 
table of contents discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in amiens  france and the closing of our las pinas  philippines plant  reducing inventory levels by over million by the end of compared with we exceeded this goal and have reduced inventories by  million from december  to december   adjusting planned capital expenditures to between million and million in from  million in our capital expenditures were million in  and pursuing additional non core asset sales  including our decision to pursue offers for our european and latin american farm tire business 
we exceeded our inventory reduction goal through the combination of lower raw material costs and the implementation of an advantaged supply chain  primarily in north american tire and emea  by improving demand forecasting  increasing production flexibility through shorter lead times and reduced production lot sizes  reducing the quantity of raw materials required to meet an improved demand forecast  changing the composition of our logistics network by closing and consolidating certain distribution warehouses  increasing local production and reducing longer lead time off shore imports  and reducing in transit inventory between our plants and regional distribution centers 
at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to  million at december  cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by improvements in trade working capital of  million and proceeds from the issuance of our billion senior notes due partially offsetting these increases in cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of million  the repayment at maturity of our million senior floating rate notes due and the million net repayment of amounts incurred under our first lien revolving credit facility due at december  and  we had  million and  million  respectively  of unused availability under our various credit agreements 
the table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of december in millions billion first lien revolving credit facility due million revolving credit facility due china financing agreements other domestic and international debt notes payable and overdrafts at december   our unused availability included approximately million which can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in china 
these financing arrangements along with government grants should provide funding for most of the cost related to the relocation and expansion of these manufacturing facilities 
there were no borrowings outstanding under these financing agreements at december  in  we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately million to million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately billion to billion 
we also expect interest expense to range between million and million 
the strategic initiatives described above are intended to permit us to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations 
if market opportunities exist  we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions 
in order to effectively extend the maturity date of a portion of our indebtedness coming due in  in february  we commenced an offer to exchange any and all of our million in aggregate principal amount of notes due for up to million in aggregate principal amount of a new series of notes due 
table of contents the completion of the exchange offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including that we receive valid tenders  not validly withdrawn  of at least million in aggregate principal of the notes due in addition  sri has certain minority exit rights that  if triggered and exercised  could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sri s interests in gdte and gdtna following the determination of the fair value of sri s interests 
for further information regarding our global alliance with sri  including the events that could trigger sri s exit rights  see item business 
description of goodyear s business global alliance 
as of the date of this filing  sri has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable 
our ability to service debt and operational requirements are also dependent  in part  on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group  whether in the form of dividends  loans or otherwise 
in certain countries where we operate  such as venezuela  transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends  loans  advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to various restrictions  such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country 
in addition  certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments restrict the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash 
thus  we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt 
because of the inherent uncertainty of overcoming these restrictions  we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries that are subject to such restrictions to be integral to our liquidity or readily available to service our debt and operational requirements 
at december   approximately million of net assets were subject to such restrictions 
at december   we had cash denominated in venezuelan bolivares fuertes of million calculated at the december  official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes to each us dollar  third party us dollar denominated accounts payable of million  and us dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable of million 
effective january   venezuela s economy is considered a highly inflationary economy under us generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of our financial statements are required to be recorded directly in the statement of operations 
on january   the venezuelan government announced the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte and the establishment of a two tier exchange structure 
as a result  we expect to record a charge in the first quarter of in connection with the remeasurement of our balance sheet to reflect the devaluation 
if calculated at the new official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes to each us dollar  the charge is expected to be approximately million  net of tax 
if in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate  we may realize additional gains or losses that would be recorded in the statement of operations 
goodyear venezuela contributed a significant portion of latin american tire s sales and operating income in the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte and weak economic conditions are expected to adversely impact latin american tire s operating results by million to million as compared to for further information regarding the venezuelan currency devaluation and its anticipated impact on goodyear  see item business recent developments venezuelan currency devaluation  and for a discussion of the risks related to our international operations  including venezuela  see item a

we believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment

if this were to occur  our ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense may not be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
as of december   our availability under this facility of million  plus our available cash of million  totaled billion  which is in excess of million 
we become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales 
the covenant provides that  before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien  senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness  we must first offer to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of consolidated net secured indebtedness to ebitda pro forma senior secured leverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than to in addition  our million senior secured european and german revolving credit facilities contain non financial covenants similar to the non financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to gdte and its subsidiaries 
this financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow gdte s ratio of consolidated net jv indebtedness to consolidated european jv ebitda to be greater than to at the end of any fiscal quarter 
consolidated net jv indebtedness is determined  through march   net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of million held by gdte and its subsidiaries  cash and cash equivalents in excess of million held by the parent company and its us subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met 
consolidated net jv indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated goodyear entities 
this financial covenant is also included in our pan european accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with this financial covenant 
there are no known future changes or new covenants to any of our existing debt obligations 
covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility  or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt 
as of december   we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities 
the terms available cash  ebitda  consolidated interest expense  consolidated net secured indebtedness  pro forma senior secured leverage ratio  consolidated net jv indebtedness and consolidated european jv ebitda have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities 
ebitda per our amended and restated credit facilities if the amount of availability under our first lien revolving credit facility plus our available cash as defined in that facility is less than million  we may not permit our ratio of ebitda as defined in that facility covenant ebitda to consolidated interest expense as defined in that facility to be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
since our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility plus our available cash is in excess of million  this financial covenant is not currently applicable 
our amended and restated credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if  after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment  our ratio of covenant ebitda to consolidated interest expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed to certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments 
our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above 
we believe that 
table of contents these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test 
covenant ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results  but rather as a measure of limitations imposed under our credit facilities 
covenant ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to either i income from operations or ii cash flows from operating activities 
our failure to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
limitations on our ability to incur debt in accordance with our credit facilities could affect our liquidity  and we believe that the presentation of covenant ebitda provides investors with important information 
the following table presents the calculation of ebitda and the calculation of covenant ebitda in accordance with the definitions in our amended and restated credit facilities for the periods indicated 
other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than we do 
certain line items are presented as defined in the credit facilities and do not reflect amounts as presented in the consolidated financial statements 
those line items also include discontinued operations 
year ended december  in millions goodyear net loss income interest expense united states and foreign taxes depreciation and amortization expense ebitda credit facilities adjustments other adjustments to goodyear net loss income minority interest in net income of subsidiaries other non cash items capitalized interest and other interest related expense rationalization charges covenant ebitda in other adjustments primarily include the sale of certain properties in akron  ohio 
in  other adjustments primarily include a million pre tax gain on the sale of our engineered products business 
potential future financings in addition to our previous financing activities  we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or a capital markets transaction  possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity 
given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions  access to the capital markets cannot be assured 
our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
however  a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt 
dividends under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing  additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment  and certain financial tests are satisfied 
asset dispositions the restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses  and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions 

table of contents commitments and contingent liabilities contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of december  payment due by period as of december  in millions total beyond debt obligations capital lease obligations interest payments operating leases pension benefits  n a other postretirement benefits workers compensation binding commitments uncertain income tax positions debt obligations include notes payable and overdrafts 
the minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations is million 
these amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements 
payments related to variable rate debt are based on the six month libor rate at december  plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented 
the amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt 
operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of million  million  million  million  million  and million in each of the periods above  respectively  for a total of million 
payments  net of minimum sublease rentals  total  million 
the present value of the net operating lease payments is million 
the operating leases relate to  among other things  real estate  vehicles  data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets 
no asset is leased from any related party 
the obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of december  although subject to change  the amounts set forth in the table for  and represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for domestic defined benefit pension plans under current erisa law  and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non us pension plans  plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non us pension plans 
for years after  the amounts shown in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for our domestic defined benefit pension plans  plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non us pension plans  and do not include estimates for contributions to our funded non us pension plans 
the expected contributions for our domestic plans are based upon a number of assumptions  including projected target liability interest rate of for  for  for  for and for  and plan asset returns of for and beyond 
future contributions are also affected by other factors such as future interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  
table of contents how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions  and any changes to current law which would grant additional funding relief for defined benefit plan sponsors 
the payments presented above are expected payments for the next years 
the payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect 
under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans 
the obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis 
the estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims 
the present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is million 
binding commitments are for raw materials and investments in land  buildings and equipment 
these amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of december  we have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters 
additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities  environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities 
these other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature 
we cannot  with any degree of reliability  determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled 
accordingly  these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table 
in addition  the following contingent contractual obligations  the amounts of which cannot be estimated  are not included in the table above the terms and conditions of our global alliance with sri  as set forth in the global alliance agreements between sri and us  provide for certain minority exit rights available to sri upon the occurrence of certain events enumerated in the global alliance agreements  including certain bankruptcy events  changes in our control or breaches of the global alliance agreements 
sri s exit rights  in the event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of sri s exit rights  could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sri s minority interests in gdte and gdtna following the determination of the fair value of sri s interests 
for further information regarding our global alliance with sri  including the events that could trigger sri s exit rights  see item business 
description of goodyear s business global alliance 
pursuant to certain long term agreements  we will purchase minimum amounts of various raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments  or in quantities that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our production levels 
we do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts 
we generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term  intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
we may  however  from time to time  enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets  undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments  or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 

table of contents we have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off balance sheet arrangements 
those guarantees totaled approximately million at december  and expire at various times through for further information about our guarantees  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no

such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions  are inherently uncertain  are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution 
actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including deteriorating economic conditions in any of our major markets  or an inability to access capital markets when necessary  may materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity  if we do not achieve projected savings from various cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected  we face significant global competition  increasingly from lower cost manufacturers  and our market share could decline  our pension plans are significantly underfunded and further increases in the underfunded status of the plans could significantly increase the amount of our required contributions and pension expenses  higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  work stoppages  financial difficulties or supply disruptions at our major oe customers  dealers or suppliers could harm our business  continued pricing pressures from vehicle manufacturers may materially adversely affect our business  if we experience a labor strike  work stoppage or other similar event our financial position  results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected  our long term ability to meet current obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness is dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results  the challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations  we have a substantial amount of debt  which could restrict our growth  place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health  any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our secured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations  our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner  our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly  we have substantial fixed costs and  as a result  our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales  we may incur significant costs in connection with product liability and other tort claims  our reserves for product liability and other tort claims and our recorded insurance assets are subject to various uncertainties  the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the amounts recorded  
table of contents we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds  which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results  our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results  we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results  the terms and conditions of our global alliance with sri provide for certain exit rights available to sri upon the occurrence of certain events  which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sri s minority interests in gdte and gdtna following the determination of the fair value of those interests 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business could be materially adversely affected  and we may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control  such as war  acts of terror  political unrest  public health concerns  labor disputes or natural disasters 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors 
we will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts  events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber  synthetic rubber  carbon black  fabrics  steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities 
approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives  whose cost may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 
we currently do not hedge commodity prices 
we do  however  use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials  including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power and expand our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials 
interest rate risk we continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix 
within defined limitations  we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
we will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates  and are normally designated as cash flow hedges 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates  and are normally designated as fair value hedges 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions 
at december   of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging compared to at an average rate of at december  we also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances 
we may also enter into interest rate contracts that change the basis of our floating interest rate exposure 
there were no interest rate contracts at december  there was one such interest rate contract outstanding at december  in october  we entered into a basis swap contract under which we paid six month libor and received one month libor plus a premium 
the notional principal amount of the swap was billion and it matured in october during  the weighted average interest rates paid and received were and  respectively 
during  the weighted average interest rates paid and received were and  respectively 
fair value gains and losses on the contract are recorded in other expense 
the fair value of the contract at december  was a liability of million 

table of contents the following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt  excluding capital leases  at december in millions carrying amount liability fair value liability pro forma fair value liability the pro forma information assumes a basis point decrease in market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption 
the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models 
foreign currency exchange risk we enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
foreign currency forward and option contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and royalty agreements  and forecasted purchases and sales 
contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation 
the following table presents foreign currency derivative information at december in millions fair value asset liability pro forma decrease in fair value contract maturities the pro forma decrease in fair value assumes a adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of positions outstanding at that date under that assumption 
the sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models 
fair values are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at december as follows in millions asset liability accounts receivable other assets other current liabilities the counterparties to our interest rate and foreign exchange contracts were substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks or other financial institutions that are recognized market makers 
we control our credit exposure by diversifying across multiple counterparties and by setting counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of counterparty credit risk such as credit default swap spreads 
we also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible 
based on our analysis  we consider the risk of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts to be remote 
however  the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its obligations when due could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity in the period in which it occurs
