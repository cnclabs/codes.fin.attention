as of december   we had  on a consolidated basis  total assets of billion  loans receivable of billion  total deposits of billion  and stockholders equity of million 
we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments  service charges  and mortgage banking income 
deposits and fhlb borrowed funds are our primary source of funding 
our largest expenses are interest on our funding sources and salaries and related employee benefits 
we measure our performance by calculating our return on average common equity  return on average assets  and net interest margin 
we also measure our performance by our efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing non interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income

table of contents overview our net income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in on a diluted earnings per share basis  our net earnings increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in the increase in earnings is associated with several items 
during  we incurred merger expenses related to the consolidation of our charters and a special assessment from the fdic 
during  we had a higher provision for loan losses and other real estate owned oreo losses  sold our investment in white river bancshares  conducted an efficiency study and incurred investment security impairments 
other to changes include a basis point increase in net interest margin  reduced salaries and employee benefits and increases in recurring fdic and state assessment fees 
we do not consider the merger expenses or the special assessment to be part of core earnings 
excluding the million after tax or diluted earnings per share negative impact of these two non core items  core net income and core diluted earnings per common share for were million and  respectively 
our return on average assets was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in our return on average common equity was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in the changes were primarily due to the previously discussed changes in net income for the year ended december   compared to the same period in our net interest margin  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in our ability to improve pricing on our deposits and hold down the decline of interest rates on loans allowed the company to expand net interest margin 
our efficiency ratio calculated by dividing non interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in the improvement in our efficiency ratio is primarily due the on going implementation of the efficiency study and charter consolidation combined with the improvements in our net interest margin

table of contents overview our net income decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in on a diluted earnings per share basis  our net earnings decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to stock dividend adjusted for the same period in the year to date decrease in earnings is primarily associated with an increase in our provision for loan losses associated with the unfavorable economic conditions  particularly in the florida market  combined with write downs on other real estate owned  merger expenses from our bank charter consolidation and an impairment write off on two trust preferred investment securities 
these items were mitigated by our acquisition of centennial bancshares  inc  a gain on the sale of our investment in white river bancshares  inc and organic growth of our bank subsidiary 
our return on average assets was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in our return on average equity was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in the changes were primarily due to the previously discussed changes in net income for the year ended december   compared to the same period in our net interest margin  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in our strong loan growth which was funded by run off in the investment portfolio and deposit growth in  combined with our acquisition of centennial bancshares  inc and improved pricing on our deposits allowed the company to improve net interest margin 
our efficiency ratio calculated by dividing non interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in the change in our efficiency ratio is primarily due to continued improvement of our operations offset with the previously discussed changes in net income for the year ended december   compared to the same period in our total assets increased million  a growth of  to billion as of december   from billion as of december  our loan portfolio increased million  a growth of  to billion as of december   from billion as of december  stockholders equity increased million  a growth of  to million as of december   compared to million as of december  asset and loan increases are primarily associated with our acquisition of centennial bancshares  inc and organic growth of our bank subsidiary

critical accounting policies overview 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies  generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry 
these policies  in certain areas  require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document 

table of contents we consider a policy critical if i the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate  and ii different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on our financial statements 
using these criteria  we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are those associated with our lending practices  including the accounting for the allowance for loan losses  foreclosed assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes and stock options 
investments 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
securities that are held as available for sale are used as a part of our asset liability management strategy 
securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes  changes in prepayment risk  the need to increase regulatory capital  and other similar factors are classified as available for sale 
loans receivable and allowance for loan losses 
substantially all of our loans receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge offs  as it is management s intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff 
interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against income 
the allowance represents an amount that  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses on identifiable loans that may become uncollectible and probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the amounts of provisions for loan losses are based on management s analysis and evaluation of the loan portfolio for identification of problem credits  internal and external factors that may affect collectability  relevant credit exposure  particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending  current collateral values and other relevant factors 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms thereof 
we apply this policy even if delays or shortfalls in payments are expected to be insignificant 
the aggregate amount of impaired loans is used in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and amount of provisions thereto 
losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when in the process of collection it appears likely that losses will be realized 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due 
when accrual of interest is discontinued  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
loans are placed on non accrual status when management believes that the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful  or generally when loans are days or more past due 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely 
accrued interest related to non accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for loan losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year 
interest income on non accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received  although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal 
non accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than days past due  the customer has made required payments for at least six months  and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest 
foreclosed assets held for sale 
assets acquired by foreclosure or in settlement of debt and held for sale are valued at estimated fair value as of the date of foreclosure  and a related valuation allowance is provided for estimated costs to sell the assets 
management evaluates the value of foreclosed assets held for sale periodically and increases the valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value 
changes in the valuation allowance are charged or credited to gain or loss on oreo 

table of contents intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions 
the core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists 
the core deposit intangibles are being amortized over to months on a straight line basis 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other in the fourth quarter 
income taxes 
we use the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the values of the assets and liabilities as reflected in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
any estimated tax exposure items identified would be considered in a tax contingency reserve 
changes in any tax contingency reserve would be based on specific development  events  or transactions 
we and our subsidiary file consolidated tax returns 
our subsidiary provides for income taxes on a separate return basis  and remits to us amounts determined to be currently payable 
stock options 
in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation and fasb asc  equity based payments to non employees  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant 
the company recognizes compensation expense for the grant date fair value of the option award over the vesting period of the award 
acquisitions and equity investments on january   we acquired centennial bancshares  inc  an arkansas bank holding company 
centennial bancshares  inc owned centennial bank  located in little rock  arkansas which had total assets of million  loans of million and total deposits of million on the date of acquisition 
the consideration for the merger was million  which was paid approximately  or million in cash and  or million  in shares of our common stock 
in connection with the acquisition  million of the purchase price  consisting of  in cash and  shares of our common stock  was placed in escrow related to possible losses from identified loans and an irs examination 
in the first quarter of  the irs examination was completed which resulted in million of the escrow proceeds being released 
in the fourth quarter of  approximately  of losses from the escrowed loans was identified 
after  we were reimbursed for those losses 
the remaining escrow funds were released 
in addition to the consideration given at the time of the merger  the merger agreement provided for additional contingent consideration to centennial s stockholders of up to a maximum of million  which could be paid in cash or our common stock at the election of the former centennial accredited stockholders  based upon the earnings performance 
the final contingent consideration was computed and agreed upon in the amount of million on march  we paid this amount to the former centennial stockholders on a pro rata basis on march  all of the former centennial stockholders elected to receive the contingent consideration in cash 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded total goodwill of million and a core deposit intangible of  during and in january  we purchased of the common stock during the formation of white river bancshares  inc of fayetteville  arkansas for million 
white river bancshares owns all of the stock of signature bank of arkansas  with branch locations in northwest arkansas 
in january  white river bancshares issued an additional million of common stock 
to maintain our ownership  we made an additional investment of million in january during april  white river bancshares acquired of the stock of brinkley bancshares  inc in brinkley  arkansas 
as a result  we made a million additional investment in white river bancshares on june  to maintain our ownership 
on march   white river bancshares repurchased our investment in their company which resulted in a one time gain of million 

table of contents in our continuing evaluation of our growth plans for the company  we believe properly priced bank acquisitions can complement our organic growth and de novo branching growth strategies 
in the near term  our principal acquisition focus will be to expand our presence in arkansas and other nearby markets  and in florida  through pursuing fdic assisted acquisition opportunities 
in our opinion  the fastest and lowest risk way for well capitalized institutions like home bancshares to gain meaningful market share in a profitable manner is to participate in accretive fdic assisted acquisitions 
we are continually evaluating potential bank acquisitions to determine what is in the best interest of our company 
our goal in making these decisions is to maximize the return to our investors 
branches we intend to continue opening new commonly referred to de novo branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas if opportunities arise 
during  we opened a branch location in the arkansas community of heber springs 
during  we opened two de novo branch locations 
these branch locations are located in the arkansas communities of morrilton and cabot 
presently  we are evaluating additional opportunities but have no firm commitments for any additional de novo branch locations 
as a result of the evaluation process for cost saving opportunities under the efficiency study  three existing arkansas branches were closed during the second quarter of the locations closed were located in new edinburg  kingsland and one of our two heights neighborhood locations in little rock 
charter consolidation we have recently combined the charters of our subsidiary banks into a single charter and adopted centennial bank as the common name 
in the fourth quarter of  first state bank and marine bank consolidated and adopted centennial bank as its new name 
community bank and bank of mountain view were completed in the first quarter of  and twin city bank and the original centennial bank finished the process in june of all of our banks now have the same name  logo and charter  allowing for a more customer friendly banking experience and seamless transactions across our entire banking network 
we remain committed  however  to our community banking philosophy and will continue to rely on local community bank boards and management built around experienced bankers with strong local relationships 
holding company status during the second quarter of  we changed from a financial holding company to a bank holding company 
since we were not utilizing any of the additional permitted activities allowed to our financial holding company status  this will not change any of our current business practices 
results of operations for the years ended december   and our net income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in on a diluted earnings per share basis  our net earnings increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in the increase in earnings is associated with several items 
during  we incurred merger expenses related to the consolidation of our charters and a special assessment from the fdic 
during  we had a higher provision for loan losses and oreo losses  sold our investment in white river bancshares  conducted an efficiency study and incurred investment security impairments 
other to changes include a basis point increase in net interest margin  reduced salaries and employee benefits and increases in recurring fdic and state assessment fees 
we do not consider the merger expenses or the special assessment to be part of core earnings 
excluding the million after tax or diluted earnings per share negative impact of these two non core items  core net income and core diluted earnings per common share for were million and  respectively 

table of contents our net income decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in on a diluted earnings per share basis  our net earnings decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to stock dividend adjusted for the same period in the year to date decrease in earnings is primarily associated with an increase in our provision for loan losses associated with the unfavorable economic conditions  particularly in the florida market  combined with write downs on other real estate owned  merger expenses from our bank charter consolidation and an impairment write off on two trust preferred investment securities 
these items were mitigated by our acquisition of centennial bancshares  inc  a gain on the sale of our investment in white river bancshares  inc and organic growth of our bank subsidiaries 
net interest income net interest income  our principal source of earnings  is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets 
factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned on loans and investments and rates paid on deposits and other borrowings  the level of non performing loans and the amount of non interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate 
the federal reserve board sets various benchmark rates  including the federal funds rate  and thereby influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions 
the federal funds rate  which is the cost to banks of immediately available overnight funds  began in at 
the rate then remained constant until september   when the federal funds rate was lowered by basis points to 
the federal funds rate decreased another basis points on october  and december  declining to 
during  the rate decreased by basis points on january   basis points on january   basis points on march   basis points on april  and basis points to a rate of as of october  the rate continued to fall basis points on october  and to basis points to a low of to on december  net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase in net interest income was the result of a million decrease in interest income combined with a million decrease in interest expense 
the million decrease in interest income was primarily the result of the repricing of our earning assets in the declining interest rate environment offset slightly by a higher level of earning assets 
the repricing of our earning assets in the declining interest rate environment resulted in a million decrease in interest income while the higher level of earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of million  for the year ended december  the million decrease in interest expense for the year ended december   is primarily the result of our interest bearing liabilities repricing in the declining interest rate environment combined with a reduction in our interest bearing liabilities 
the repricing of our interest bearing liabilities in the declining interest rate environment resulted in a million decrease in interest expense 
the reduction of our interest bearing liabilities resulted in lower interest expense of million 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase in net interest income was the result of a million increase in interest income combined with a million decrease in interest expense 
the million increase in interest income was primarily the result of our acquisition of centennial bancshares  inc and organic growth of our bank subsidiaries offset by the repricing of our earning assets in the declining interest rate environment 
the higher level of earning assets resulted in an improvement in interest income of million  and our earning assets repricing in the declining interest rate environment resulted in a million decrease in interest income for the year ended december  the million decrease in interest expense for the year ended december   is primarily the result of our interest bearing liabilities repricing in the declining interest rate environment offset by our acquisition of centennial bancshares  inc and organic growth of our bank subsidiaries

 accounting for contingencies and no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
specific allocations are determined for loans considered to be impaired and loss factors are assigned to the remainder of the loan portfolio to determine an appropriate level in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is increased  as necessary  by making a provision for loan losses 
the specific allocations for impaired loans are assigned based on an estimated net realizable value after a thorough review of the credit relationship 
the potential loss factors associated with the remainder of the loan portfolio are based on an internal net loss experience  as well as management s review of trends within the portfolio and related industries 
during these tough economic times  the company continues to follow our historical conservative procedures for lending and evaluating the provision and allowance for loan losses 
we have not and do not participate in higher risk lending such as subprime 
our practice continues to be primarily traditional real estate lending with strong loan to value ratios 
while there have been declines in our collateral value  particularly florida  these declines have been addressed in our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents generally  commercial  commercial real estate  and residential real estate loans are assigned a level of risk at origination 
thereafter  these loans are reviewed on a regular basis 
the periodic reviews generally include loan payment and collateral status  the borrowers financial data  and key ratios such as cash flows  operating income  liquidity  and leverage 
a material change in the borrower s credit analysis can result in an increase or decrease in the loan s assigned risk grade 
aggregate dollar volume by risk grade is monitored on an ongoing basis 
our management reviews certain key loan quality indicators on a monthly basis  including current economic conditions  delinquency trends and ratios  portfolio mix changes  and other information management deems necessary 
this review process provides a degree of objective measurement that is used in conjunction with periodic internal evaluations 
to the extent that this review process yields differences between estimated and actual observed losses  adjustments are made to the loss factors used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
our company is primarily a real estate lender in arkansas and florida 
as such we are subject to declines in asset quality when real estate prices fall during a recession 
the current recession has harshly impacted the real estate market in florida 
during  many real estate values declined in the plus percent range in florida 
the decline in the florida real estate prices did slowdown in compared to the decline in florida real estate prices for were about half of those from the previous year 
the arkansas economy has been stable over the past several years with no boom or bust 
as a result  the arkansas economy has fared much better with only low single digit declines in real estate values in and during the first quarter of  we began to experience a decline in our asset quality  particularly in the florida market 
in  non performing loans started the year at million but ended the year at million 
as of december   non performing loans are million 
the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to be charged against the current period s earnings  to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered adequate in relation to the estimated risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the provision was million for the year ended december   million for  and million for our provision for loan losses decreased million  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the decrease in the provision for loan losses is primarily associated with a more modest decline in asset quality versus the previous year

the most significant components of the loan portfolio were commercial real estate  residential real estate  consumer  and commercial and industrial loans 
these loans are primarily originated within our market areas of central arkansas  north central arkansas  northwest arkansas  southern arkansas  southwest florida and the florida keys and are generally secured by residential or commercial real estate or business or personal property within our market areas 
as a result of the current recession  certain credit markets have experienced difficult conditions and volatility during and  particularly florida

as of december   our installment consumer loan portfolio totaled million  or of our total loan portfolio  compared to the million  or of our loan portfolio as of december  this decrease is associated with normal payoffs and pay downs combined with flat loan demand 

table of contents commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans are made for a variety of business purposes  including working capital  inventory  equipment and capital expansion 
the terms for commercial loans are generally one to seven years 
commercial loan applications must be supported by current financial information on the borrower and  where appropriate  by adequate collateral 
commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow debt service coverage  primary and secondary sources of repayment  the financial strength of any guarantor  the borrower s liquidity and leverage  management experience  ownership structure  economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral 
the loan to value ratio depends on the type of collateral 
generally speaking  accounts receivable are financed at between and of accounts receivable less than days past due 
inventory financing will range between and with no work in process depending on the borrower and nature of inventory 
we require a first lien position for those loans

table presents the distribution of the maturity of our loans as of december  the table also presents the portion of our loans that have fixed interest rates versus interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans based on changes in the interest rate environment 
a loan is considered fixed rate if the loan is currently at its adjustable floor or ceiling 
as a result of the low interest rates environment  the company has approximately million of loans that cannot be additionally priced down but could price up if rates were to return to higher levels 
these loans are shown as fixed rate in the table below

table of contents when management determines that a loan is no longer performing  and that collection of interest appears doubtful  the loan is placed on non accrual status 
loans that are days past due are placed on non accrual status unless they are adequately secured and there is reasonable assurance of full collection of both principal and interest 
our management closely monitors all loans that are contractually days past due  treated as special mention or otherwise classified or on non accrual status 
generally  non accrual loans that are days past due without assurance of repayment are charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
table sets forth information with respect to our non performing assets as of december      and as of these dates  we did not have any non performing restructured loans

our bank subsidiary recognizes income principally on the accrual basis of accounting 
when loans are classified as non accrual  the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued  unless the credit characteristics of the loan improves 
if a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible  the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for loan losses 
since december   the declining real estate market  particularly in florida  has and may continue to increase our level of non performing loans 
while we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   as additional facts become known about relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability and our assumptions  it may result in us making additions to the provision for loan loss during as of december   we had million of restructured loans that are in compliance with the modified terms and are not reported as past due or non accrual in table of the million in restructured loans  million are also reported as impaired loans 
most of these credits are where borrowers have continued to pay as agreed but negotiated a lower interest rate due to general economic pressures rather than credit specific pressure 
our florida market contains million of these restructured loans 
total foreclosed assets held for sale were million as of december   compared to million as of december  for an increase of million 
the increase is primarily the result of foreclosure on two florida housing developments in the keys 
each of the two housing developments has vacant lots and one completed model home 
the foreclosed assets held for sale are comprised of million of assets located in florida with the remaining million of assets located in arkansas 
the florida foreclosed assets at september  included a substantially vacant owner occupied commercial rental center in the keys 
this property was sold during the fourth quarter of the two florida housing developments are currently listed for sale with a broker 

table of contents total non performing loans were million as of december   compared to million as of december  for an increase of million 
the increase in non performing loans is primarily from our florida market 
non performing loans are million in the florida market 
if the non accrual loans had been accruing interest in accordance with the original terms of their respective agreements  interest income of approximately million for the year ended december   million in  and  in would have been recorded 
interest income recognized on the non accrual loans for the years ended december   and was considered immaterial 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will not receive all amounts due according to the contracted terms of the loans 
impaired loans may include non performing loans loans past due days or more and non accrual loans and certain other loans identified by management that are still performing 
as of december   average impaired loans were million compared to million as of december  as of december   impaired loans were million compared to million as of december  for an increase of million 
as a result of the unfavorable economic conditions that are impacting our florida market  impaired loans in florida increased million 
non performing loans and impaired loans are defined differently 
some loans may be included in both categories 
allowance for loan losses overview 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which our management believes is adequate to absorb all probable losses on loans in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provision of possible loan losses charged to income  which increases the allowance 
in determining the provision for possible loan losses  it is necessary for our management to monitor fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge offs and recoveries and to periodically review the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of current and anticipated economic conditions 
if actual losses exceed the amount of allowance for loan losses  our earnings could be adversely affected 
as we evaluate the allowance for loan losses  we categorize it as follows i specific allocations  ii allocations for classified assets with no specific allocation  iii general allocations for each major loan category  and iv miscellaneous allocations 
specific allocations 
as a general rule  if a specific allocation is warranted  it is the result of an analysis of a previously classified credit or relationship 
our evaluation process in specific allocations includes a review of appraisals or other collateral analysis 
these values are compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance 
if a loss is determined to be reasonably possible  the possible loss is identified as a specific allocation 
if the loan is not collateral dependent  the measurement of loss is based on the expected future cash flows of the loan 
allocations for classified assets with no specific allocation 
we establish allocations for loans rated special mention through loss in accordance with the guidelines established by the regulatory agencies 
a percentage rate is applied to each loan category to determine the level of dollar allocation 
general allocations 
we establish general allocations for each major loan category 
this section also includes allocations to loans  which are collectively evaluated for loss such as residential real estate  commercial real estate consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans 
the allocations in this section are based on a historical review of loan loss experience and past due accounts 
we give consideration to trends  changes in loan mix  delinquencies  prior losses  and other related information 
miscellaneous allocations 
allowance allocations other than specific  classified  and general are included in our miscellaneous section 

table of contents charge offs and recoveries 
total charge offs decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in total recoveries increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the changes in net charge offs are due to the unfavorable economic conditions particularly in florida 
during when real estate prices were harshly impacted by the recession  we took a proactive stance on our asset quality by increasing charge offs 
in real estate prices continued to fall but at lower pace than  resulting in a reduced level of charge offs than the previous year

table of contents allocated allowance for loan losses 
we use a risk rating and specific reserve methodology in the calculation and allocation of our allowance for loan losses 
while the allowance is allocated to various loan categories in assessing and evaluating the level of the allowance  the allowance is available to cover charge offs incurred in all loan categories 
because a portion of our portfolio has not matured to the degree necessary to obtain reliable loss data from which to calculate estimated future losses  the unallocated portion of the allowance is an integral component of the total allowance 
although unassigned to a particular credit relationship or product segment  this portion of the allowance is vital to safeguard against the imprecision inherent in estimating credit losses 
the changes for the period ended december  in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the individual types of loans are primarily associated with the changes in asset quality  net charge offs during the year and normal changes in the outstanding loan portfolio for those loan types from december  table presents the allocation of allowance for loan losses as of the dates indicated

table of contents investment securities our securities portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue 
securities within the portfolio are classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading based on the intent and objective of the investment and the ability to hold to maturity 
fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities 
as of december  and  we had no held to maturity or trading securities 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as other comprehensive income 
securities that are held as available for sale are used as a part of our asset liability management strategy 
securities classified as available for sale may be sold in response to interest rate changes  changes in prepayment risk  the need to increase regulatory capital  and other similar factors 
available for sale securities were million as of december   compared to million as of december  the estimated effective duration of our securities portfolio was years as of december  as of december   million  or  of the available for sale securities were invested in mortgage backed securities  compared to million  or  of the available for sale securities in the prior year 
to reduce our income tax burden  million  or  of the available for sale securities portfolio as of december   was primarily invested in tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions  compared to million  or  of the available for sale securities as of december  also  we had approximately million  or  in obligations of us government sponsored enterprises in the available for sale securities portfolio as of december   compared to million  or  of the available for sale securities in the prior year 
certain investment securities are valued at less than their historical cost 
these declines primarily resulted from the volatility in the markets 
based on evaluation of available evidence  we believe the declines in fair value for these securities are temporary 
for debt securities that management has no intent to sell and believes that it more likely than not will not be required to sell prior to recovery  only the credit loss component of the impairment is recognized in earnings  while the noncredit loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
should the impairment of any of these securities become other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized in net income in the period the other than temporary impairment is identified 
during  we became aware that two investment securities in our other securities category had become other than temporarily impaired 
as a result of this impairment we charged off these two securities 
the total of this charge off was million or diluted earnings per share stock dividend adjusted for these investment securities are a pool of other financial holding companies subordinated debentures throughout the country 
since the federal government has begun to seize institutions in these pools  it has resulted in our investment becoming worthless

those products consist of checking accounts  regular savings deposits  now accounts  money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
deposits are gathered from individuals  partnerships and corporations in our market areas

the interest rates paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet our funding requirements 
we will continue to manage interest expense through deposit pricing and do not anticipate a significant change in total deposits unless our liquidity position changes 
we believe that additional funds can be attracted and deposit growth can be accelerated through deposit pricing if we experience increased loan demand or other liquidity needs

under the transaction account guarantee program through june   all non interest bearing transaction accounts are fully guaranteed by the fdic for the entire amount in the account 
coverage under the transaction account guarantee program is in addition to and separate from the coverage available under the fdic s general deposit insurance rules 
since business non interest bearing accounts currently have unlimited deposit insurance coverage  many of our business customers have chosen to move their money from repurchase agreements to non interest bearing demand accounts to take advantage of this unlimited coverage

expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities  because fhlb may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations 
the increase in fhlb borrowing capacity is a result of the higher eligibility rates from centennial bank formerly first state bank being applied to the loans of the former charters which collapsed into centennial bank formerly first state bank during the first six months of this year 
centennial bank s formerly first state bank eligibility rates will be reevaluated and it is projected that the fhlb borrowing capacity will lower in the future

examples of these commitments include but are not limited to operating lease obligations  fhlb advances  lines of credit  subordinated debentures  unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding  conditional agreements generally having certain expiration or termination dates 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the commitments may expire without being drawn upon

table of contents quarterly results the company reported a net loss of million  or diluted loss per share for the fourth quarter of during this quarter  the company experienced several items that it does not consider part of its core earnings 
these items include an increased provision for loan losses over our normal quarterly provision  million of write downs on other real estate owned  million of merger expenses from our bank charter consolidation  a million impairment write down on two trust preferred investment securities and  of other income resulting from our ownership of arkansas banker s bank stock during their fourth quarter reorganization 
the increased fourth quarter provision for loan loss was primarily attributable to the increase in non performing loans during the quarter as a result of rapidly deteriorating florida market conditions 
during  non performing loans increased from million in the third quarter to million during the fourth quarter  most of which was concentrated in florida 
the write down on other real estate was primarily due to the declining market value of one commercial property in florida 
the write down on trust preferred investment securities was a result of bank closures in the fourth quarter that occurred within the pool

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and market risk management liquidity management 
liquidity refers to the ability or the financial flexibility to manage future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and fund operations 
maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity allows us to have sufficient funds available for reserve requirements  customer demand for loans  withdrawal of deposit balances and maturities of deposits and other liabilities 
our primary source of liquidity at our holding company is dividends paid by our bank subsidiary 
applicable statutes and regulations impose restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be declared by our bank subsidiary 
further  any dividend payments are subject to the continuing ability of the bank subsidiary to maintain compliance with minimum federal regulatory capital requirements and to retain its characterization under federal regulations as a well capitalized institution 
our bank subsidiary has potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers 
many of these obligations and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loans customers are expected to expire without being drawn upon  therefore the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position 
liquidity needs can be met from either assets or liabilities 
on the asset side  our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  maturities of investment securities and scheduled repayments and maturities of loans 
we maintain adequate levels of cash and equivalents to meet our day to day needs 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents balances were million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  as of december  our investment securities and fed funds sold were million as of december  and million as of december  
table of contents as of december   million  or  of our securities portfolio  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured within one year  and million  or  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured after one year but within five years 
as of december   million  or  of our securities portfolio  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured within one year  and million  or  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured after one year but within five years 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of securities were pledged as collateral for various public fund deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
our commercial and real estate lending activities are concentrated in loans with maturities of less than five years with both fixed and adjustable rates 
as of december  and  approximately billion  or  and billion  or  respectively  of our loans matured within one year and or had adjustable interest rates 
a loan is considered fixed rate if the loan is currently at its adjustable floor or ceiling 
as a result of the low interest rate environment  the company has approximately million of loans that cannot be additionally priced down but could price up if rates were to return to higher levels 
additionally  we maintain loan participation agreements with other financial institutions in which we could participate out loans for additional liquidity should the need arise 
on the liability side  our principal sources of liquidity are deposits  borrowed funds  and access to capital markets 
customer deposits are our largest sources of funds 
as of december   our total deposits were billion  or of total assets  compared to billion  or of total assets  as of december  we attract our deposits primarily from individuals  business  and municipalities located in our market areas 
we may occasionally use our fed funds lines of credit in order to temporarily satisfy short term liquidity needs 
we have fed funds lines with three other financial institutions pursuant to which we could have borrowed up to million and million on an unsecured basis as of december  and  respectively 
these lines may be terminated by the respective lending institutions at any time 
as a result of our recent charter consolidation  there has been reduction in our availability to borrow fed funds on an unsecured basis 
we also maintain lines of credit with the federal home loan bank 
our fhlb borrowings were million as of december  and million as of december  all of the outstanding balance for december  and are long term advances 
our fhlb borrowing capacity was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our current operations 
market risk management 
our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
we do not hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
asset liability management 
our management actively measures and manages interest rate risk 
the asset liability committees of the boards of directors of our holding company and bank subsidiary are also responsible for approving our asset liability management policies  overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings  and reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position 
one of the tools that our management uses to measure short term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model 
this analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using base market rates and using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario 
the income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the re pricing relationships for each of our products 
many of our assets are floating rate loans  which are assumed to re price immediately  and proportional to the change in market rates  depending on their contracted index 
some loans and investments include the opportunity of prepayment embedded options  and accordingly the simulation model uses indices to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields 
our non term deposit products re price more slowly  usually changing less than the change in market rates and at our discretion 

table of contents this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions 
it assumes the balance sheet remains static and that its structure does not change over the course of the year 
it does not account for all factors that impact this analysis  including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change 
furthermore  loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly 
interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over twelve months by and basis points  respectively 
at december   our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us 
table presents our sensitivity to net interest income as of december  table sensitivity of net interest income percentage change interest rate scenario from base up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points interest rate sensitivity 
our primary business is banking and the resulting earnings  primarily net interest income  are susceptible to changes in market interest rates 
it is management s goal to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risks 
a key element in the financial performance of financial institutions is the level and type of interest rate risk assumed 
the single most significant measure of interest rate risk is the relationship of the repricing periods of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the more closely the repricing periods are correlated  the less interest rate risk we assume 
we use repricing gap and simulation modeling as the primary methods in analyzing and managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis attempts to capture the amounts and timing of balances exposed to changes in interest rates at a given point in time 
as of december  our one year cumulative repricing gap was 
the stock offering proceeds have yet to be deployed and increased our one year cumulative repricing gap by 
excluding these non deployed funds our gap position as of december  was asset sensitive with a one year cumulative repricing gap of  compared to as of december  during these periods  the amount of change our asset base realizes in relation to the total change in market interest rate exceeds that of the liability base 
we have a portion of our securities portfolio invested in mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities are included based on their assumed maturity dates 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties
