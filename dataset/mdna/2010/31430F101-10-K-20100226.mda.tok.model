d a more detailed description and computation of hotel ebitda is contained in the non gaap financial measures section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are focused on increasing market share  limiting expenses to preserve margins and managing our balance sheet by extending debt maturities and ensuring sufficient liquidity 
these efforts became more critical as lodging demand began to contract in we worked closely with our brand managers to develop extensive cost containment initiatives in the face of a lower revpar environment 
many of our hotels have been able to reduce labor costs permanently  and all of our hotels have trimmed non critical functions 
these cost reductions enabled us to minimize margin erosion at our hotels in despite reduced hotel revenues 
we also worked to maintain the optimal mix of business in our hotels to maximize rate and occupancy 
in  we completed the last phase of a multi year  portfolio wide renovation program designed to enhance the competitive positioning and value of our hotels 
the average market share for our hotel portfolio grew in  following a gain in  as a result of these initiatives 
in june  we completed the final phase of the comprehensive redevelopment of the san francisco marriott union square  which is situated in one of the premier hotel markets in the united states 
the hotel was rebranded as a marriott hotel in april revpar during the second half of under the marriott flag increased at this hotel  compared to  and its market share increased by 
its market share index during the second half of was compared to for before renovation 
in spite of the global recession and dysfunctional capital markets  we were able to take the following steps to build additional flexibility into our capital structure in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes due we received approximately million in net proceeds after original issue discount  fees and expenses related to the offering 
these proceeds were used to repurchase approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in and for general corporate purposes 
in june  we obtained a million non recourse term loan secured by nine hotels that matures in this loan can be extended for up to two years  subject to satisfying certain conditions that we expect to satisfy 
in june  we repaid and terminated our line of credit 
by terminating our line of credit  we eliminated certain restrictive corporate debt covenants 
in march  we refinanced a million secured loan maturing in with a million non recourse term loan that matures in  secured by the same seven hotels 
we held discussions with current and potential lenders to modify and or refinance all of our debt maturities many of these discussions are ongoing 
we increased cash held on our balance sheet by more than million 
we suspended our common dividend in december and our preferred dividend in march although dividends are not paid unless declared by felcor s board of directors  unpaid preferred dividends continue to accrue  and accrued and current preferred dividends must be paid in full prior to payment of any common dividends 
felcor s board of directors will determine whether to declare future dividends based upon various factors  including operating results  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as felcor s minimum reit distribution requirements 
revpar and hotel operating margin our revpar declined by  compared to the decline in revpar reflected depressed hotel demand  particularly from business travel  and was exacerbated by increased hotel supply growth 
occupancy at our consolidated hotels dropped because of continued demand declines and increased supply growth 
the occupancy decline drove pricing down  and adr declined at our consolidated hotels 
while  in the fourth quarter of and the beginning of  we have seen supply growth in our markets moderate and demand begin to stabilize in certain markets providing some stabilization for occupancy  we are still experiencing weak corporate travel  providing little opportunity to improve adr 
in response to the weakening economy  we worked with our brand managers to implement extensive cost containment initiatives at our hotels 
many of our hotels have been able to reduce labor costs permanently  and all of our hotels have trimmed non critical functions 
these cost reductions have enabled us to minimize margin erosion at our hotels despite reduced hotel revenues 
our hotel operating expenses decreased compared to the decline in expenses reflects various factors including decreased labor costs and improved efficiencies including permanent hotel staffing reductions  decreased other room expenses and decreased incentive management fees 
employee headcount at our hotels declined compared to financial comparison in thousands  except revpar  hotel ebitda margin and percentage change year ended december  change change revpar hotel ebitda a hotel ebitda margin a income loss from continuing operations b a hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures 
a discussion of the use  limitations and importance of these non gaap financial measures and detailed reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are found elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section non gaap financial measures 
b the following amounts are included in income loss from continuing operations in thousands year ended december  impairment loss impairment loss on unconsolidated hotels hurricane loss hurricane loss on unconsolidated hotels conversion costs severance costs lease termination costs charges related to debt extinguishment abandoned projects gain on sale of assets gain on sale of condominiums gain on involuntary conversion results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a million net loss attributable to common stockholders compared to a million net loss attributable to common stockholders in our loss included a million impairment charge and a  gain from disposition both included in discontinued operations 
in  we also recorded losses from debt extinguishment in continuing operations million 
our loss included a million impairment charge million related to consolidated hotels in continuing operations  million related to consolidated hotels in discontinued operations and million related to equity method investments  million in accrued liquidated damages in discontinued operations  and hurricane related expenses of million million in continuing operations and  in discontinued operations 
these charges were partially offset by a million gain in continuing operations related to involuntary conversions associated with the final settlement of hurricane claims  and a million adjustment to gains in discontinued operations associated with prior year hotel sales 
in total revenue was million  a decrease compared to the decrease in revenue is attributed principally to a decrease in revpar  which was driven by a decrease in occupancy and an decrease in adr 
hotel departmental expenses decreased million compared to this expense reduction reflects i the decrease in occupancy  ii a million decrease in labor costs  which included permanent reductions related to a decrease in hotel employees  iii reduced non critical room expenses  such as guest transportation  in room amenities  bath linen quantities  and newspaper service  and iv menu modifications and reduced food costs in banquet and restaurant outlets 
as a percentage of total revenue  hotel departmental expenses increased from to compared to while we made significant reductions in our departmental expenses  they were not sufficient enough to completely offset the decrease in revenue 
other property related costs decreased million compared to the expense reduction consisted of i a million decrease in labor costs  ii a million decrease in marketing assessments  credit card commissions and frequent guest expense all of which reflect the decrease in revenue  iii a million decrease in repairs and maintenance  partially attributed to our recently completed renovation program  iv reductions in other non critical expenses  and v improved energy efficiency 
as a percentage of total revenue  other property related costs increased from to compared to while we made significant reductions in our other property related costs  they were not sufficient enough to completely offset the decrease in revenue 
management and franchise fees decreased million compared to reflecting the decrease in revenue 
as a percent of total revenue  franchise fees and base management fees remained essentially unchanged from to these fees are based on a percentage of revenue 
incentive management fees  which are based on the profitability of the hotels  decreased million 
taxes  insurance and lease expenses decreased million compared to this decrease relates primarily to i a million decrease in hotel percentage lease expense  attributed to decreased revenue at our consolidated hotel lessees  ii a million decrease in property and general liability insurance  attributed to improved insurance rates and liability claims experience  and iii a million decrease in land leases  attributed to decreases in percentage rent based on revenue 
this was partially offset by a million increase in real estate and other taxes  largely attributed to successful resolution of property tax appeals in as a percentage of total revenue  taxes  insurance and lease expense increased from in to 
corporate expenses increased million compared to the increase in corporate expenses is attributed to bonuses awarded in recognition of the accomplishment of corporate goals including successful restructuring of our debt in the face of the dysfunctional debt market and ongoing recession in and our portfolio s relative performance  compared to our peers  from our efforts to improve market share and limit the effect of reduced revenue on hotel ebitda 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  compared to  primarily attributable to increased depreciation due from the million and million of consolidated hotel capital expenditures completed in and  respectively 
impairment charge 
in  we identified six hotels as candidates to be sold these hotels continue to be held for investment at december   and tested these hotels for impairment using undiscounted estimated cash flows over a shortened estimated remaining hold period 
of the hotels tested  four hotels failed the test  and as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million 
in addition  because of triggering events in related to changes in the capital markets  dropping travel demand and the combined effect on our stock price  we tested all of our hotels to determine if further assessment for potential impairment was required 
we had one hotel with a short term ground lease fail this test 
we determined that the book value of this hotel was not fully recoverable  and as such  recorded a million impairment charge 
other expense decreased million compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to i hurricane related expenses of million at of our hotels affected by hurricanes in  ii a decrease in condominium management fee expenses due to a decrease in condominium revenue  and iii a decrease in severance costs 
net interest expense increased million compared to this increase is primarily attributable to the issuance of our million senior secured notes in october charges related to debt extinguishment 
in  we retired million of senior notes maturing in and terminated our line of credit 
we incurred a million charge associated with these transactions 
equity in loss of unconsolidated entities was million compared to a million loss in we recorded million and million of impairment charges on our equity method investments in and  respectively 
the remainder of the change is attributed to current year operating losses from decreased revenue at our unconsolidated hotels 
discontinued operations primarily consisted of i a million adjustment to gains on sale resulting from a change in the federal tax law that allowed recovery of previously paid alternative minimum taxes on gains from hotel sales in and and ii the following items related to two hotels sold in december a million impairment loss  a  loss on sale primarily related to selling costs  and  operating losses 
discontinued operations in primarily consisted of i a million adjustment to gain on sales from revision of the tax liability associated with gains from hotel sales in and and ii the following items related to two hotels sold in december a million impairment loss  an million liquidated damage charge and  of hurricane losses 
comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of million in our loss included a million impairment charge million related to consolidated hotels in continuing operations  million related to consolidated hotels in discontinued operations and million related to equity method investments  million accrued liquidated damages in discontinued operations  and million hurricane related expenses  in continuing operations and  in discontinued operations 
these charges were partially offset by a million gain in continuing operations related to involuntary conversions from the final settlement of hurricane claims and a million adjustment to gains in discontinued operations from prior year hotel sales 
our net income included i gains from sale of hotels million  million in discontinued operations and million in income from unconsolidated entities  ii gain from the sale of condominiums million  and iii operating income from hotels sold in and included in discontinued operations million 
our results of operations include two hotels acquired in december as such  our financial statements reflect increases in revenues and expenses associated with these hotels that are not reflected in our financial statements 
in total revenues increased million compared to  of which million related to the two hotels acquired in december the remainder of the increase is principally attributable to the increase in revpar at our consolidated hotels from to hotel departmental expenses increased million compared to  of which million is attributable to the two hotels acquired in december and the remainder primarily reflects expenses associated with increased occupancy compared to as a percentage of total revenue  hotel departmental expenses increased from to compared to rooms expense decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to  but food and beverage expense increased as a percent of total revenue from to  and other operating department expenses increased as a percent of total revenue from to compared to the increases in food and beverage expense and other department expenses as a percent of total revenue are primarily due to the mix and nature of the business of the two hotels acquired in december  which are both resort properties 
adr at these hotels was nearly higher than the remainder of the portfolio in  which was the principal reason for the improvement in rooms expense as a percentage of total revenue 
food and beverage generally has significantly higher expenses as a percent of revenue than rooms  and those hotels contributed of our food and beverage revenue during other property related costs increased million  compared to  of which million related to the two hotels acquired in december as a percentage of total revenue  other property operating costs remained essentially unchanged at in compared to in management and franchise fees increased million  compared to  of which million resulted primarily from increases in revenue and million related to the two hotels acquired in december there was essentially no change in management and franchise fees as a percentage of revenue in compared to taxes  insurance and lease expense decreased million compared to  despite a million increase related to the two hotels acquired in december the decrease from is primarily related to a decrease in percentage rent expense of million  related to percentage leases reset in late  a decrease in real estate and other taxes of million  largely from reduced assessed values and successful resolution of prior year property taxes disputed  and a decrease in property insurance of million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million compared to  of which increase million related to the two hotels acquired in december the remainder of the increase reflects increased depreciation associated with hotel capital expenditures million in and million in 
impairment charge 
in  we identified six hotels as candidates to be sold these hotels continue to be held for investment as of december   and we tested these hotels for impairment using undiscounted estimated cash flows over a shortened estimated remaining hold period 
of the hotels tested  four hotels failed the test  as a result of which we recorded impairment charges of million 
because of triggering events in related to changes in the capital markets  dropping travel demand and the combined effect on our stock price  we tested all of our hotel assets to determine if further assessment for potential impairment was required for any of our hotels 
we had one hotel with a short term ground lease  in addition to the sale candidates noted above  fail this test 
we determined that the book value of this hotel was not fully recoverable  and as such  recorded a million impairment charge for this hotel 
other expenses increased million compared to this increase was primarily attributable to i hurricane related expenses of million at of our hotels affected by hurricanes in  ii severance costs of  related to the staffing reductions at our hotels and iii amortization of intangible assets of  related to the hotels acquired in december net interest expense increased million compared to this change is primarily attributable to i a decrease in interest income of million due to lower cash balances and interest rates earned on those balances  ii an increase in interest expense of million related to the mortgage debt on the two hotels acquired in december  and iii a reduction in capitalized interest of million related to lower renovation related construction in progress  all of which was partially offset by lower interest expense of million due to lower interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt 
equity in income loss from unconsolidated entities decreased by million compared to  which decrease primarily reflects income received from the gain of million  on the sale of an unconsolidated hotel during the first quarter of  impairment charges of million recorded in  and resetting several percentage leases in late the impairment charges were comprised of million of which our share was million taken under asc and million taken under asc  related to other than temporary declines in value of certain equity method investments 
the impairment under asc includes a charge of million for one investment related to a hotel that we do not intend to sell 
gain on involuntary conversion 
in  we settled insurance claims relating to hurricane losses and realized a related million gain from involuntary conversion 
gain on sale of condominiums 
in  we finalized the sale of of the units at our royale palms condominium project and recognized a related million gain on sale under the completed contract method 
discontinued operations primarily consisted of i a million adjustment to gain on sales resulting from a revision in the tax liability associated with gains of million from hotel sales in and and ii the following items related to two hotels sold in december impairment losses of million  liquidated damages of million  and hurricane losses of  discontinued operations for primarily consisted of i operating income of million related to the hotels we sold in and  ii charges related to early debt repayment of  related to the hotels we sold in  and iii gains of million related to the sale of hotels during non gaap financial measures we refer in this annual report to certain non gaap financial measures 
these measures  including hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are measures of our financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the following tables reconcile these non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measure 
immediately following the reconciliations  we include a discussion of why we believe these measures are useful supplemental measures of our performance and of the limitations upon such measures

hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are commonly used measures of performance in the hotel industry and give investors a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our individual hotels and brand managers have direct control 
we believe that hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are useful to investors by providing greater transparency with respect to two significant measures that we use in our financial and operational decision making 
additionally  using these measures facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
we present hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin by eliminating all revenues and expenses from continuing operations not directly associated with hotel operations  including corporate level expenses  depreciation and amortization  and expenses related to our capital structure 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  we do not believe that these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  and implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  accurately reflect an adjustment in the value of our assets 
we also eliminate consolidated percentage rent paid to unconsolidated entities  which is effectively eliminated by noncontrolling interests and equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries  and include the cost of unconsolidated taxes  insurance and lease expense  to reflect the entire operating costs applicable to our consolidated hotels 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margins are presented on a same store basis including the historical results of operations from the two hotels acquired in december use and limitations of non gaap measures our management and board of directors use hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we use hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin in evaluating hotel level performance and the operating efficiency of our hotel managers 
the use of these non gaap financial measures has certain limitations 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  as presented by us  may not be comparable to hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin as calculated by other real estate companies 
these measures do not reflect certain expenses that we incurred and will incur  such as depreciation  interest and capital expenditures 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures  and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit  cash flow from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during  hotel operations provided most of the cash needed to meet our cash requirements including paying normal course  capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities primarily hotel operations  was million  which reflects an million decrease  compared to  due primarily to declining hotel revenues 
at december   we had million of cash on hand  including approximately million held under management agreements to meet working capital needs 
the global recession has resulted in considerable negative pressure on travel spending 
as a result  lodging demand was weak throughout and contributed to further reductions of our consolidated hotel revpar 
for  we expect revpar to decline by to compared to  and we expect cash from operating activities to range from negative million to positive million 
we are subject to increases in hotel operating expenses  including wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  utilities and insurance expenses that can fluctuate disproportionately to revenues 
some of these operating expenses are difficult to predict and control  which lends volatility in our operating results 
as a result of the decline in revpar and weak travel demand beginning in late  we implemented extensive cost containment initiatives at our hotels  including reducing headcount and improving productivity and energy efficiency 
if revpar continues to decrease and or hotel ebitda margins shrink  our operations  earnings and or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
investing activities for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities decreased million  compared to  due primarily to reduced spending on hotel capital expenditures 
we made extensive capital investments in our hotels between and  and all of our hotels have been renovated 
as a result  we have significantly curtailed capital spending in we expect to spend a limited amount of capital in the near future without compromising the value and quality of our hotels 
in  we completed approximately million of capital improvements at our hotels of which million was spent on renovation and redevelopment projects 
our liquidity preservation efforts also extend to acquisitions and redevelopment projects 
we did not acquire any hotels during or we have also postponed spending on redevelopment projects  other than to advance ongoing approval and entitlement processes 
in order to enhance long term shareholder value  as part of our strategic plan as in the past and as market conditions allow  we intend to sell lower growth hotels that no longer meet our investment criteria  thereby freeing our capital for redeployment eg  reduce overall leverage  acquire other hotels or invest in remaining felcor properties 
we regularly evaluate demand and supply trends for each hotel  portfolio concentration risk and future capital needs 
we sold two hotels in  and we expect to identify additional hotels for sale when hotel cash flows recover and the hotel transaction market improves 
financing activities for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities increased by million compared to  due primarily to net proceeds from a million secured term loan and net proceeds of million from the offering of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes due partially offset by the repurchase of million of our senior notes due in and repayment of million on our line of credit 
we suspended payment of our common dividend in december and our preferred dividend in march we paid approximately million of preferred dividends in january 
our board of directors will determine the amount of future common and preferred dividends  if any  based upon various factors including operating results  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as minimum reit distribution requirements 
unpaid preferred dividends continue to accrue  and accrued and current preferred dividends must be paid in full prior to payment of any common dividends 
for  we expect negative cash flow after capital expenditures and normally occurring principal payments  which will be funded from cash on hand 
capital markets  and our access to financing on reasonably acceptable terms  have historically been affected by external events and circumstances  such as recessions  major bank failures  rising unemployment  shrinking gdp  acts of terrorism  etc 
events or circumstances of similar magnitude or impact could adversely affect the availability and cost of our capital going forward 
in addition  if the current recession continues  our operating cash flow and the availability and cost of capital for our business will continue to be adversely affected 
line of credit 
in june  we repaid the million balance under our line of credit  which was then terminated 
by terminating our line of credit  we eliminated certain restrictive corporate debt covenants 
secured debt 
at december   we had consolidated secured debt totaling billion  encumbering of our consolidated hotels with an aggregate net book value of billion including hotels that were encumbered by our new senior secured notes issued in october 
except in the case of our new senior notes  our mortgage debt is recourse solely to the specific hotels securing the debt 
however  a violation of any of the recourse carve out provisions  including fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse carve out provisions  could cause this debt to become fully recourse to us 
much of our hotel mortgage debt allows us to substitute collateral under certain conditions 
most of our mortgage debt is prepayable  subject to various prepayment  yield maintenance or defeasance obligations 
loans secured by certain of our hotels provide for lock box arrangements under certain circumstances 
we generally are permitted to retain an amount required to cover our budgeted hotel operating expenses  taxes  debt service  insurance and capital expenditure reserves but the remaining revenues would flow through a lock box if a specified debt service coverage ratio is not met 
with the exception of one hotel  all of our hotels subject to lock box provisions currently exceed the applicable minimum debt service coverage ratios 
secured financings 
in october  we issued million of senior secured notes due the new senior secured notes are secured by a pledge of our limited partner interests in felcor lp  first mortgages and related security interests on up to hotels and pledges of equity interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries 
we received approximately million of net proceeds from sale of these notes after original issue discount  fees and expenses related to the offering 
the proceeds were used to repurchase approximately million of our senior notes due in all of our floating rate senior notes and million of our senior notes and for general corporate purposes 
in june  we obtained a million non recourse term loan secured by nine hotels 
this loan bears interest at libor subject to a floor plus basis points  and initially matures in  but can be extended for as many as two years  subject to satisfying certain conditions that we expect to satisfy 
the proceeds from this loan were used for general corporate purposes 
in march  we obtained a million loan secured by seven hotels 
the proceeds of the loan were used to repay the balance of an existing million loan secured by the same properties that would have matured on april  the new loan matures in and bears interest at 
maturing debt 
we successfully refinanced all of our debt that matured in  extended the maturity of one loan scheduled to mature in  as well as refinanced nearly all of our corporate debt that was scheduled to mature in we continue to make progress with the various lenders to modify and or refinance our remaining secured debt scheduled to mature in may that debt consists of eight non recourse mortgage loans with a combined current balance of million  secured by hotels six of which are cross collateralized to secure one loan 
with regard to these loans  we believe that extending the maturity dates is in the best interest of the lenders and felcor 
as a consequence  we intend to seek such extensions 
in addition  we intend to discuss other loan modification options  as well as explore other refinancing opportunities and potential asset sales as a means of satisfying our obligations under our other mortgage debt as they mature 
with regard to two of these loans  the mortgaged hotels cash flows do not cover debt service  and we stopped funding the short falls in december senior notes 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes due our senior notes require that we satisfy total leverage  secured leverage and interest coverage tests in order to i incur additional indebtedness except to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt  as defined under our indentures  ii pay dividends in excess of the minimum distributions required to meet the reit qualification test  iii repurchase capital stock  or iv merge 
we are currently restricted from paying dividends except to the extent necessary to satisfy the reit qualification requirement that we distribute currently at least of our taxable income and repurchasing capital stock in connection with these tests 
in connection with the sale of our new senior notes  we amended the indenture governing our senior notes of which million remain outstanding to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants  guarantees  collateral and certain events of default provisions 
interest rate caps 
to fulfill requirements under certain loans  we entered into interest rate cap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of million at december  and these interest rate caps were not designated as hedges and had insignificant fair values at both december  and  resulting in no significant net earnings impact 
consolidated debt consisted of the following in thousands encumbered december  hotels interest rate maturity date mortgage debt a hotels may mortgage debt hotels may senior notes none b june mortgage debt a hotels june c mortgage debt hotels l d august e line of credit none l august mortgage debt hotels l f november g senior floating rate notes none l december mortgage debt a hotels l h may i mortgage debt hotel may j mortgage debt hotels april mortgage debt a hotels june august senior secured notes k hotels october mortgage debt hotel july capital lease and other hotel various total hotels a the hotels securing this debt are subject to separate loan agreements and are not cross collateralized 
b as a result of a rating down grade in february  the interest rate on our senior notes increased to 
c in february  the maturity date on these loans was extended from june to june d libor for this loan is subject to a floor 
e this loan can be extended for as many as two years  subject to satisfying certain conditions 
f we have purchased an interest rate cap that caps libor at and expires in november for this notional amount 
g the maturity date assumes that we will exercise the remaining one year extension option that is exercisable  at our sole discretion  and would extend the current november maturity to h we have purchased interest rate caps that cap libor at and expire in may for aggregate notional amounts of million 
i we have exercised the first of three successive one year extension options that extend  at our sole discretion  maturity to j in february  the maturity date on this loan was extended from may to may k these senior notes have million in aggregate principal outstanding and were sold at a discount that provides an effective yield of before transaction costs 
contractual obligations we have obligations and commitments to make certain future payments under debt agreements and various contracts 
the following schedule details these obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years years after years debt a b operating leases purchase obligations ihg liquidated damages total contractual obligations a our long term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  b assumes the extension through november  at our option  of million of debt with a current maturity of november and the extension through may  at our option  of million of debt with a current maturity of may off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that own an aggregate of hotels referred to as hotel joint ventures 
we had an unconsolidated investment in a venture that leases one of those hotels referred to as an operating lessee 
of the remaining joint venture hotels  we own more than of the operating lessees operating hotels and one hotel is operated without a lease 
we also owned a interest in entities that provide condominium management services and develop condominiums in myrtle beach  south carolina 
none of our directors  officers or employees owns any interest in any of these joint ventures or entities 
the hotel joint ventures had million of non recourse mortgage debt relating to these hotels  of which our pro rata portion was million  none of which is reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our liabilities with regard to non recourse debt and the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are members or partners in joint ventures are generally limited to guarantees of the borrowing entity s obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the venture and other typical exceptions from the non recourse provisions in the mortgages  such as for environmental liabilities 
we have recorded equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and received distributions of million of which million was provided from operations  million of which million was provided from operations  and million of which million was provided from operations  for the years  and  respectively 
the principal source of income for our hotel joint ventures is percentage lease revenue from their operating lessees 
capital expenditures on the hotels owned by our hotel joint ventures are generally funded from the income from operations of these ventures 
however  if a venture has insufficient cash flow to meet operating expenses or make necessary capital improvements  the venture may make a capital call upon the venture members or partners to fund such necessary improvements 
it is possible that  in the event of a capital call  the other joint venture member or partner may be unwilling or unable to make the necessary capital contributions 
under such circumstances  we may elect to make the other party s contribution as a loan to the venture or as an additional capital contribution by us 
under certain circumstances  a capital contribution by us may increase our equity investment to greater than and may require that we consolidate the venture  including all of its assets and liabilities  into our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to those ventures that are partnerships  the hotels owned by these ventures could perform below expectations and result in the insolvency of the ventures and the acceleration of their debts  unless the members or partners provide additional capital 
in some ventures  the members or partners may be required to make additional capital contributions or have their interest in the venture be reduced or offset for the benefit of any party making the required investment on their behalf 
we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in a venture or investing additional capital under circumstances that do not assure a return on that investment 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future 
we are also subject to the risk that inflation will cause increases in hotel operating expenses disproportionately to revenues 
seasonality the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may utilize cash on hand or borrowings to satisfy our obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  the carrying value of investments in hotels  litigation  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in one or more of our hotels held for investment has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis  or net book value  of the investment 
we test for impairment when certain events occur  including one or more of the following projected cash flows are significantly less than recent historical cash flows  significant changes in legal factors or actions by a regulator that could affect the value of our hotels  events that could cause changes or uncertainty in travel patterns  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a hotel will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in the evaluation of impairment of our hotels  and in establishing impairment charges  we made many assumptions and estimates on a hotel by hotel basis  which included the following annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  holding periods  expected remaining useful lives of assets  estimates in fair values taking into consideration future cash flows  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices  and future capital expenditures 
we are also required under gaap to record an impairment charge when one or more of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries experiences an other than temporary decline in fair value 
any decline in fair value that is not expected to be recovered in the next months is considered other than temporary 
we record an impairment in our equity based investments as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
our estimates of fair values are based on future cash flow estimates  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying hotels could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of our hotels or investments in unconsolidated entities  thereby requiring future impairment charges 
we capitalize interest and certain other costs  such as property taxes  land leases  property insurance and employee costs related to hotels undergoing major renovations and redevelopments 
such costs capitalized in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we make estimates with regard to when components of the renovated asset or redevelopment project are taken out of service or placed in service when determining the appropriate amount and time to capitalize these costs 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we could capitalize too much or too little with regard to a particular project 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets  and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation and amortization expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value 
any remaining unallocated acquisition costs are treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations prepared by management and or independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources such as those obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
we make estimates with respect to contingent liabilities for losses covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for self insured losses under our insurance programs when it becomes probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we are self insured for the first  per occurrence  of our general liability claims with regard to of our hotels 
we review the adequacy of our reserves for our self insured claims on a regular basis 
our reserves are intended to cover the estimated ultimate uninsured liability for losses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred at the end of each accounting period 
these reserves represent estimates at a given date  generally utilizing projections based on claims  historical settlement of claims and estimates of future costs to settle claims 
estimates are also required since there may be delays in reporting 
because establishment of insurance reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if our insurance reserves of million  at december   for general liability losses are insufficient  we will record an additional expense in future periods 
property and catastrophic losses are event driven losses and  as such  until a loss occurs and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
we had recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to property or catastrophic losses at december  our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  have cumulative potential future tax deductions totaling million 
the net deferred income tax asset associated with these potential future tax deductions was million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million related to our trss deferred tax asset  because of the uncertainty of realizing the asset s benefit 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase operating income in the period such determination was made 
recent changes to accounting standards the fasb recently amended its guidance surrounding a company s analysis to determine whether any of its variable interests constitute controlling financial interests in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics a the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the new guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november  and  accordingly  we will reevaluate our interests in variable interest entities for the period beginning on january  to determine that the entities are reflected properly in the financial statements as investments or consolidated entities 
we do not anticipate that the implementation of this guidance will have a material effect on our financial statements
