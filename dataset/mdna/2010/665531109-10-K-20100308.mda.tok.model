item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item and the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
a discussion of our past financial results before march  is not pertinent to the business plan of our company on a going forward basis  due to the change in our business which occurred upon consummation of the merger on march  overview and outlook we are an oil and gas exploration and production company 
our properties are located in montana  north dakota and new york 
our corporate strategy is to build shareholder value through the development and acquisition of oil and gas assets that exhibit economically producible hydrocarbons 
as of march   we controlled the rights to mineral leases covering approximately  net acres of land 
our goal is to continue to explore for and develop hydrocarbons within the mineral leases we control as well as continue to expand our acreage position should opportunities present themselves 
in order to accomplish our objectives we will need to achieve the following  continue to develop our substantial inventory of high quality core bakken acreage with results consistent with those to date  retain and attract talented personnel  continue to be a low cost producer of hydrocarbons  and continue to manage our financial obligations to access the appropriate capital needed to develop our position of primarily undrilled acreage 
the following table sets forth selected operating data for the periods indicated 
production volumes and average sales prices are derived from accrued accounting data for the relevant period indicated

results of operations for the periods ended december  and december  during and we significantly increased our drilling activities  generated income and achieved net earnings for both the and fiscal years 
to date  we have developed approximately seven percent of our total drillable acreage inventory assuming one well per acre spacing unit and we expect to continue to add substantial volumes of production on a quarter over quarter basis going forward into the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had established production from gross net wells in which we hold working interests  gross net wells of which had established production as of december  our production at december  approximated  barrels of oil per day  compared to approximately barrels of oil per day as of december  our production increased to  barrels of oil per day as of march  we drilled with a success rate in and with bakken or three forks wells completed or completing 
we also had three successful red river discoveries at december  as of march   we expect to participate in the drilling of approximately gross net wells in our revenues  costs and net income increased in compared to as we continued our development plans and significantly increased our production 
revenues for the twelve month period ended december  were  compared to  for the twelve month period ended december  primarily due to increases in production 
adjusted total cash and non cash expenses including production expenses  production taxes  general and administrative expenses  director fees  depletion expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve month period ended december  were  and for the twelve month period ended december  were  of this amount in  approximately  consisted of non cash expense related to the issuance of restricted stock and an additional  consisted of non cash depletion expenses 
depletion expenses for the twelve month period ended december  were we had net income of  representing approximately per basic share for the twelve month period ended december  compared to adjusted net income of  representing approximately per basic share for the twelve month period ended december  results of operations for the periods ended december  and december  our first successful well commenced drilling in the fourth quarter of  and we did not realize revenue from that well until the first quarter of during we significantly increased our drilling activities compared to  generated income and achieved net earnings in the third and fourth quarters of and for the fiscal year as a whole 
our production at december  approximated barrels of oil per day 
this compares to approximately barrels of oil per day as of december  revenues for the twelve month period ended december  were  compared to no revenues for the twelve month period ended december  our expenses in fiscal years and consisted principally of general and administrative costs 
our costs increased moderately as we proceeded with our development plans in total expenses for the twelve month period ended december  were  and for the twelve month period ended december  were  we had net income of  representing approximately per basic share for the twelve month period ended december   compared to a net loss of  for the twelve month period ended december  operation plan we expect to drill approximately net wells in with drilling capital expenditures approximating million 
the wells are expected to target both the bakken and three forks formations 
drilling capital expenditures are expected to increase in compared to previously published guidance due to the continued success of longer laterals and additional fractional stimulation stages 
we currently expect to drill wells during at an average completed cost of million per well 
based on evolving conditions in the field  we expect to deploy approximately million towards further strategic acreage acquisitions during we expect to fund all commitments using cash on hand  cash flow and our currently undrawn credit facility 
our future financial results will depend primarily on i the ability to continue to source and screen potential projects  ii the ability to discover commercial quantities of oil and gas  iii the market price for oil and gas  and iv the ability to fully implement our exploration and development program  which is dependent on the availability of capital resources 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these respects  that the prices of oil and gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production  or that we will be able to obtain additional funding if necessary 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to meet potential cash requirements 
we have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of common stock and by short term borrowings 
in the future  we anticipate we will be able to provide the necessary liquidity by the revenues generated from the sales of our oil and gas reserves in our existing properties  however  if we do not generate sufficient sales revenues we will continue to finance our operations through equity and or debt financings 
the following table summarizes total current assets  total current liabilities and working capital at december  current assets  current liabilities working capital  cit capital usa  inc credit facility on february   we completed the closing of a revolving credit facility with cit that provides up to a maximum principal amount of million of working capital for exploration and production operations the credit facility 
the borrowing base of funds available under the credit facility will be redetermined semi annually based upon the net present value  discounted at per annum  of the future net revenues expected to accrue from our interests in proved reserves estimated to be produced from our oil and gas properties 
million of financing is currently available under the credit facility 
an additional million of financing could become available upon subsequent borrowing base redeterminations based on the deployment of funds from the credit facility 
the credit facility terminates on february  as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
we have the option to designate the reference rate of interest for each specific borrowing under the credit facility as amounts are advanced 
borrowings based upon the london interbank offering rate libor will be outstanding for a period of one  three or six months as designated by us and bear interest at a rate equal to over the one month  three month or six month libor rate to be no less than 
any borrowings not designated as being based upon libor will have no specified term and generally will bear interest at a rate equal to over the greater of a the current three month libor rate plus or b the current prime rate as published by jp morgan chase bank  na we have the option to designate either pricing mechanism 
payments are due under the credit facility in arrears  in the case of a loan based on libor on the last day of the specified loan period and in the case of all other loans on the last day of each march  june  september and december 
all outstanding principal is due and payable upon termination of the credit facility 
the applicable interest rate increases under the credit facility and the lenders may accelerate payments under the credit facility  or call all obligations due under certain circumstances  upon an event of default 
the credit facility references various events constituting a default on the credit facility  including  but not limited to  failure to pay interest on any loan under the credit facility  any material violation of any representation or warranty under the credit agreement in connection with the credit facility  failure to observe or perform certain covenants  conditions or agreements under the credit facility  a change in control of our company  default under any other material indebtedness we might have  bankruptcy and similar proceedings and failure to pay disbursements from lines of credit issued under the credit facility 
the credit facility requires that we enter into a swap agreement with macquarie bank limited macquarie to hedge production over the month term of the credit facility 
we have strategically entered into constant priced swap arrangements with macquarie since inception of the credit facility to hedge our expected production 
a full discussion of our current swap arrangements is set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk in item a of this report 
all of our obligations under the credit facility and the swap agreements with macquarie are secured by a first priority security interest in any and all of our assets pursuant to the terms of a guaranty and collateral agreement and perfected by a mortgage  notice of pledge and security and similar documents 
follow on equity offerings on june   we completed a follow on equity offering pursuant to which we sold million shares of common stock to various institutional investors for per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds to our company following deduction of agency fees and expenses were approximately million and were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  primarily including borrowings incurred in connection with our acquisition of north dakota bakken assets from windsor bakken llc 
ck cooper company acted as lead placement agent for the offering 
on november   we completed an additional follow on equity offering pursuant to which we sold million shares of common stock to various institutional investors for per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds to our company following deduction of agency fees and expenses were approximately and were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  pursue acquisition opportunities and for other working capital purposes 
canaccord adams inc acted as lead placement agent for the offering 
fig partners  llc acted as co placement agent for the offering 
satisfaction of our cash obligations for the next months with the addition of equity capital during and our credit facility  we believe we have sufficient capital to meet our drilling commitments and expected general and administrative expenses for the next twelve months at a minimum 
nonetheless  any strategic acquisition of assets may require us to access the capital markets at some point in we may also choose to access the equity capital markets rather than our credit facility or other debt instruments to fund accelerated or continued drilling at the discretion of management and depending on prevailing market conditions 
we will evaluate any potential opportunities for acquisitions as they arise 
given our non leveraged asset base and anticipated growing cash flows  we believe we are in a position to take advantage of any appropriately priced sales that may occur 
however  there can be no assurance that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
over the next months it is possible that our existing capital  the credit facility and anticipated funds from operations may not be sufficient to sustain continued acreage acquisition 
consequently  we may seek additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion through additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities 
no assurance can be made that such financing would be available  and if available it may take either the form of debt or equity 
in either case  the financing could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our stockholders 
though we achieved profitability in and remained profitable throughout  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of operations  particularly companies in the oil and gas exploration industry 
such risks include  but are not limited to  an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth 
to address these risks we must  among other things  implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy  continue to develop and upgrade technology and products  respond to competitive developments  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks  and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation and pricing the oil and gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry put extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs 
conversely  in a period of declining prices  associated cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion 
material changes in prices also impact our current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans  impairment assessments of oil and gas properties  and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   we did not have any material long term debt obligations  capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations or purchase obligations requiring future payments other than our office lease that expires on january   and outstanding promissory notes issued to our executive officers 
the following table illustrates our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years office lease note payable to michael l 
reger note payable to ryan r 
gilbertson automobile leases our office lease commenced on february  and continues for a period of five years 
in february  our audit committee and the compensation committee approved the issuance of  principal amount non negotiable  unsecured subordinated promissory notes to both michael reger our chief executive officer and ryan gilbertson our chief financial officer in lieu of paying cash bonuses earned in the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum and are subordinate to any secured debt of our company 
our credit facility now limits our ability to make interest and principal payments on the notes 
all unpaid principal and interest on the notes are due and payable in full in a single lump sum on march  in july  we entered into automobile leases for vehicles utilized by two of our employees  which expire in july  in september we entered into automobile leases for vehicles utilized by two additional employees  which expire in september  product research and development we do not anticipate performing any significant product research and development given our current plan of operation 
expected purchase or sale of any significant equipment we do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment as such items are not required by us at this time or anticipated to be needed in the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies note to the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report describe various accounting policies critical to an understanding of our financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
crude oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
our revenue during generally would have increased or decreased along with any increases or decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices  but the exact impact on our income is indeterminable given the variety of expenses associated with producing and selling oil that also increase and decrease along with oil prices 
we have previously entered into derivative contracts to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
on november   due to the volatility of price differentials in the williston basin  we de designated all derivatives that were previously classified as cash flow hedges and in addition  we have elected not to designate any subsequent derivative contracts as accounting hedges 
as such  all derivative positions are carried at their fair value on the balance sheet and are marked to market at the end of each period 
any realized and unrealized gains or losses are recorded as gain loss on derivatives net  as an increase or decrease in revenues on the statement of operations rather than as a component of other comprehensive income loss or other income expense 
we had the following swap arrangements outstanding as of december  dates volumes bbl month price january december january december january february dates volumes bbl month price january december january december dates volumes bbl month price january december january december dates volumes bbl month price january december january december interest rate risk we did not have outstanding any borrowings under our credit facilities or other obligations that would subject us to significant interest rate risk at december  our credit facility entered into with cit on february   will  however  subject us to interest rate risk on borrowings under that facility 
our credit facility with cit allows us to fix the interest rate of borrowings under our credit facility for all or a portion of the principal balance for a period up to six months 
to the extent the interest rate is fixed  interest rate changes affect the instrument s fair market value but do not impact results of operations or cash flows 
conversely  for the portion of our borrowings that has a floating interest rate  interest rate changes will not affect the fair market value but will impact future results of operations and cash flows
