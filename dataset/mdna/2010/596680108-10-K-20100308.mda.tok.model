fixed service charges are billed in advance by our subsidiary  tidewater  and are recognized in revenue as the service is provided 
rates middlesex on august   middlesex filed an application with the njbpu seeking permission to increase its base rates by  or million 
the request was made necessary by increased costs of operations  chemicals and fuel  electricity  taxes  labor and benefits  decreases in industrial and commercial customer demand patterns as well as capital investment of approximately million since middlesex s last rate filing in april of discovery by the intervening parties has begun 
we cannot predict whether the njbpu will ultimately approve  deny  or reduce the amount of the request 
a decision by the njbpu is expected by the second quarter of on july   middlesex implemented a njbpu approved pwac in order to recover increased costs of million to purchase untreated water from the new jersey water supply authority and treated water from a non affiliated regulated water utility 
tidewater on january   tidewater filed an application with the depsc seeking permission to increase its base rates by  which was necessitated by increased costs of operations  maintenance and taxes  as well as capital investment since tidewater s last rate filing in april of on september   the depsc approved a base rate settlement that had been reached amongst the parties that reflects an overall increase of 
this rate increase approval is expected to generate additional annual revenues of million based on a return on common equity 

index effective january   tidewater received approval from the depsc to increase their dsic from to 
dsic is a depsc approved rate that allows water utilities to recover their investment in non revenue producing capital improvements to the water system in between base rate increase requests 
as of march   this rate was set to zero in conjunction with interim rates approved in the base rate case described above 
on december   tidewater received approval from the depsc to increase their dsic from to effective january  southern shores in accordance with the tariff and underlying contract established for southern shores  an annual rate increase of was implemented on january  under the terms of the contract the increase cannot exceed the lesser of the regional consumer price index or 
operating results by segment our ability to increase operating income and net income is based significantly on four factors weather  adequate and timely rate relief  effective cost management  and customer growth 
these factors are evident in the discussions below which compare our results of operations from prior years 
the company has two operating segments  regulated and non regulated 
our regulated segment contributed  and of total revenues  and  and of net income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the discussion of the company s results of operations is on a consolidated basis  and includes significant factors by subsidiary 
the segments in the tables included below are comprised of the following companies regulated middlesex  tidewater  pinelands  southern shores  tesi and twin lakes  non regulated usa  usa pa  and white marsh 
results of operations in compared to millions of dollars years ended december  regulated non regulated total regulated non regulated total revenues operations and maintenance depreciation other taxes operating income other income  net interest expense income taxes net income operating revenues operating revenues for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in this increase was primarily related to the following factors revenues in our middlesex system decreased million  primarily as a result of lower water consumption across our residential  commercial and industrial customer classes 
we experienced a 
index million decline in water use by our general retail metered customers compared to the same period in this lower water consumption was attributable to unfavorable weather as compared to prior years as well as decreased demand by our large commercial and industrial customers 
we are unable to determine when these customers water demands may return to previous levels  or if the decline in demand will continue indefinitely 
increased revenues of million from the pwac implemented on july   offset some of the consumption revenue decline 
all other factors affecting middlesex system revenues accounted for a million decrease in revenues 
revenues in our tidewater system increased million 
revenue of million from increased rates helped to mitigate consumption revenue decreases of million  largely attributable to those same weather and usage patterns described above 
new customer growth and other fees added million of revenue 
all other factors affecting tidewater system revenues accounted for a million increase in revenues 
usa pa s fees for managing the perth amboy water and wastewater systems were million higher than the same period in  due mostly to higher pass through charges and scheduled management fee increases 
all other operations accounted for a decrease of million in revenues 
operation and maintenance expense operation and maintenance expenses for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in this increase was primarily related to the following factors labor costs at our regulated entities increased million in as compared to  primarily due to increases in wages and resources necessary to meet the growing needs of our delaware service territory and increased overtime incurred in connection with a higher incidence of water main breaks and system maintenance in our middlesex system 
chemical and residuals disposal expenses increased by million in as compared to although unfavorable weather patterns and economic conditions resulted in a decline in water production in our new jersey and delaware systems  costs for chemicals and residuals disposal increased due to a combination of unit cost disposal rate increases and lower quality of untreated water  as influenced by abnormally high rainfall during purchased water costs in our middlesex system increased million in as compared to  primarily due to the full year s effect of our suppliers rate increases that went into effect in the fourth quarter of employee retirement benefit plan expenses increased million  primarily resulting from increased qualified employee retirement benefit plan expenses of million  largely attributable to the investment performance of the benefit plans assets  offset by a decrease of million in life insurance program expenses due to market fluctuations in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
uncollectible accounts expense increased million in as compared to  resulting from current economic conditions 
operating costs for usa pa increased million  which are recovered under the pass through mechanism in the contract 
all other operating and maintenance expense categories increased million in as compared to depreciation depreciation expense for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in due to a higher level of utility plant in service 

index other taxes other taxes remained consistent with  generally reflecting decreased taxes on lower taxable gross revenues offset by increased payroll and real estate taxes 
other income  net other income  net for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in  primarily due to increased allowance for funds used during construction from higher capitalized interest resulting from our ongoing capital program 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million from the same period in this decrease was primarily related to the following factors interest expense on long term debt decreased million in as compared to  primarily resulting from lower average long term debt outstanding in other interest expense increased million in as compared to  primarily due to increased interest costs from higher average short term debt outstanding in million as compared to million offset by decreased interest costs from lower average short term debt interest rates in as compared to income taxes income taxes for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to  primarily resulting from decreased operating income in as compared to net income and earnings per share net income for the year ended december  decreased million from the same period in basic earnings per share decreased to in as compared to in diluted earnings per share decreased to in as compared to in 
index results of operations in compared to millions of dollars years ended december  regulated non regulated total regulated non regulated total revenues operations and maintenance depreciation other taxes operating income other income expense interest expense income taxes net income operating revenues operating revenues for the year rose million over the same period in this increase was primarily related to the following factors revenues in our middlesex system increased million as a result of a base rate increase implemented october  middlesex revenues decreased million due to lower consumption by our customers during water sales improved million in our delaware water systems 
we recorded additional revenue of million as a result of an additional base rate increase that was granted to tidewater effective february   and dsic rate increases of and that went into effect january  and july   respectively 
fees charged for initial connection to our delaware water system were million lower in as new residential and commercial development has slowed in our delaware service territories 
usa pa s fees for managing the perth amboy water and wastewater systems were million higher than the same period in  due mostly to scheduled increases in the fixed fee component of the contract 
revenues from our regulated wastewater operations in delaware increased million due to customer growth 
all other operations accounted for million of additional revenues 
operation and maintenance expense operation and maintenance expenses increased million 
this increase was primarily related to the following factors even though water production was lower than in our middlesex and tidewater systems  our expenses increased million due to higher costs for water  electric power and chemicals 

index labor and benefits costs increased million  which includes million recognized for employee benefits due to market fluctuations in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
the costs to operate our regulated wastewater facilities in delaware increased million due to acquisition of the milton  delaware municipal wastewater system during and an increased number of wastewater treatment facilities in operation in delaware 
costs for service claims under our linecaresm program were million higher due in part to a increase in the number of subscribers in the program during operating costs for usa pa increased million due to higher pass through charges 
all other expense categories increased million 
depreciation depreciation expense for increased by million due to a higher level of utility plant in service 
other taxes other taxes increased by million generally reflecting additional taxes on higher taxable gross revenues  payroll and real estate 
other income  net other income was million lower than  primarily due to one time gains recorded in on two transactions related to assets no longer used in our operations 
interest expense interest expense increased by million as a result of a higher level of average short term debt outstanding when compared to income taxes income tax expense based on our current year operating results was million higher than and reflects increased revenues due to higher water rates in new jersey and delaware 
net income and earnings per share net income increased to million from million in the prior year  and basic earnings per share increased from to 
diluted earnings per share increased from to 
outlook our revenues are expected to increase in from the full year s effect of rate increases granted to tidewater in september  the january  tidewater dsic rate implementation and an anticipated rate increase for middlesex 
there can be no assurances however  that the njbpu will grant middlesex s filed rate increase request in whole or in part 

index revenues and earnings will also be influenced by weather 
changes in these factors  as well as increases in capital expenditures and operating costs  are the primary factors in determining the need for rate increase requests 
we continue to implement plans to streamline operations and reduce operating costs 
ongoing economic conditions continue to negatively impact our customers water consumption  particularly the level of water usage by our commercial and industrial customers in our middlesex system 
we are unable to determine when these customers water demands may return to previous levels  or if a reduced level of demand will continue indefinitely 
the decrease in demand by our commercial and industrial customers in our middlesex system was one of the factors that required our rate increase petition with the njbpu 
if water demand by our commercial and industrial customers in our middlesex system does not return to previous levels and or our proposed rate increase is not approved in whole or in part  our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
as a result of ongoing challenging economic conditions impacting the pace of new residential home construction  there may be an increase in the amount of preliminary survey investigation costs that will not be currently recoverable in rates 
in addition  the impact of the depressed national and local economies on the residential housing market has resulted in the suspension of construction activities on the north carolina water and wastewater facility we agreed to own and operate 
we are not obligated to assume ownership of the facilities until completion of construction by the present owner and until homes are occupied and customers are connected 
we entered into this agreement in and have invested approximately million 
construction is expected to resume as demand for new residential housing improves and we continue to preserve our rights for recovery of our investment if the project does not move forward in a timeframe acceptable to us 
on february   the company filed a petition with the njbpu seeking approval to issue up to million shares of common stock in the form of a follow on offering during the second quarter of the proceeds from the common stock offering will be used to retire short term debt 
we expect our level of short term debt borrowing to decrease in as compared to the return on assets held in our retirement benefit plans during resulted in an increase in the amount available to fund current and future obligations 
we expect this will help stabilize retirement plan benefit expenses and retirement plan cash contributions in our strategy includes continued revenue growth through acquisitions  internal expansion  contract operations and when necessary  rate relief 
we will continue to pursue opportunities in both the regulated and non regulated sectors that we believe complement existing capabilities and will ultimately increase shareholder value 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations are largely based on four factors weather  adequate and timely rate increases  effective cost management and customer growth 
the effect of those factors on net income is discussed in results of operations 
for  cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million 
as described more fully in the results of operations section above  lower earnings was the primary reason for the decrease in cash flow 
the million of net cash flow from operations enabled us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures internally for the period  with the remainder funded by bank lines of credit and other loan commitments 

index for  cash flows from operating activities increased million to million  as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher net income and depreciation 
the million of net cash flow from operations enabled us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures for the period internally  with the remainder funded with proceeds from equity issued under our dividend reinvestment plan  long term borrowings and short term borrowings 
increases in certain operating costs will impact our liquidity and capital resources 
during  we received rate relief for middlesex  tidewater and southern shores and we have filed for a base rate increase for middlesex 
we continually monitor the need for timely rate filing to minimize the lag between the time we experience increased operating and capital costs and the time we receive appropriate rate relief 
there is no certainty  however  that the njbpu  depsc or papuc will approve any or all future requested increases 
capital expenditures and commitments to fund our capital program  we use internally generated funds  short term and long term debt borrowings  and when market conditions are favorable  proceeds from sales of common stock under our drp and offerings to the public 
the table below summarizes our estimated capital expenditures for the years millions mains service lines renew program information technology systems meters hydrants plant improvements other general infrastructure needs total estimated capital expenditures program to clean and cement unlined mains in the middlesex system the actual amount and timing of capital expenditures is dependent on customer growth  residential new home construction and sales and project scheduling 
to pay for our capital program in  we plan on utilizing internally generated funds proceeds from an anticipated common stock offering in the second quarter of proceeds from the sale of common stock through the drp funds available and held in trust under existing new jersey state revolving fund srf loans currently  million and delaware srf loans currently  million and  if available  proceeds from delaware and new jersey srf programs 
the srf programs provide low cost financing for projects that meet certain water quality and system improvement benchmarks 
funds available under a tidewater depsc approved loan up to million available through june  short term borrowings  if necessary  through million of available lines of credit with several financial institutions 
as of december   we had million outstanding against the lines of credit 

index sources of liquidity short term debt 
the company had established lines of credit aggregating million as of december  at december   the outstanding borrowings under these credit lines were million at a weighted average interest rate of 
in january  the company increased its available lines of credit to million 
the weighted average daily amounts of borrowings outstanding under the company s credit lines and the weighted average interest rates on those amounts were million and million at and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
long term debt 
subject to regulatory approval  the company periodically finances capital projects under srf loan programs in new jersey and delaware 
these government programs provide financing at interest rates that are typically below rates available in the broader financial markets 
a portion of the borrowings under the new jersey srf is interest free 
we participated in the delaware srf loan program during and expect to participate in the delaware srf program for up million 
we will also participate in the new jersey srf program in for up to million 
in march  tidewater closed on a million depsc approved loan and immediately used million of the available funds to retire short term debt 
terms for the new long term debt include an interest rate of  final maturity in april and equal principal payments over the life of the loan 
in june  tidewater borrowed million at a rate of with a final maturity in january and equal principal payments over the life of the loan 
tidewater can borrow the remaining million in whole or in increments at its discretion until june   at an interest rate based on market conditions and with a maximum final maturity date of january substantially all of the utility plant of the company is subject to the lien of its mortgage  which includes debt service and capital ratio covenants 
the company is in compliance with all of its mortgage covenants and restrictions 
common stock 
the company periodically issues shares of common stock in connection with its drp 
the company raised million through the issuance of shares under the drp during on december   the company announced a purchase discount for optional cash purchases and reinvested dividends under the drp 
the discount applies to purchases made by the drp between february  and june  as noted above  we anticipate issuing up to million shares of common stock in the second quarter of contractual obligations in the course of normal business activities  the company enters into a variety of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
some of these items result in direct obligations on the company s balance sheet while others are commitments  some firm and some based on uncertainties  which are disclosed in the company s other underlying consolidated financial statements 

index the table below presents our known contractual obligations for the periods specified as of december  payment due by period millions of dollars total less than year years years more than years long term debt notes payable interest on long term debt purchased water contracts wastewater operations employee retirement plans total amounts are not determinable after one year due to the volatility of factors we use to determine estimated future contributions to our employee retirement benefit plans  including market performance  discount rates  long term rates of return  healthcare cost trend rates  wage increases  participant eligibility and participant turnover 
guarantees usa pa operates the city of perth amboy s perth amboy water and wastewater systems under a service contract agreement through june  the agreement 
under the agreement  usa pa receives a fixed fee and a variable fee based on increased system billing 
in connection with the agreement  perth amboy  through the middlesex county improvement authority  issued approximately million in three series of bonds 
in  as part of the agreement negotiations with perth amboy  middlesex agreed to guarantee debt service payments on one of those series of bonds  designated the series c serial bonds  in the principal amount of approximately million 
perth amboy guaranteed the two other series of bonds 
the series c serial bonds have various maturity dates with the final maturity date on september  as of december   approximately million of the series c serial bonds remained outstanding 
to date  middlesex has not had to fund any debt service obligations as guarantor 
we are obligated to perform under the guarantee in the event notice is received from the series c serial bonds trustee of an impending debt service deficiency 
our obligation in that case would be to pay scheduled debt service payments as they come due 
if middlesex funds any debt service obligations as guarantor  there is a provision in the agreement that requires perth amboy to reimburse us 
there are other provisions in the agreement that we believe make it unlikely that we will be required to perform under the guarantee  such as scheduled annual rate increases for the water and wastewater services as well as rate increases due to unforeseen circumstances 
in the event revenues from customers could not satisfy the reimbursement requirements  perth amboy has ad valorem taxing powers  which could be used to raise the needed amount 

index critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and standards often requires the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to the calculation of pension and postemployment benefits  unbilled revenues  and the recoverability of certain assets  including regulatory assets 
the company bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and current operating environment 
changes in any of the variables that are used for the company s estimates  assumptions and judgments may lead to significantly different financial statement results 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
regulatory accounting we maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries  which account for of operating revenues and of total assets  are subject to regulation in the states in which they operate 
those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities rules and guidelines  which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements 
in those instances  the company follows the guidance in the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic regulated operations regulatory accounting 
in accordance with regulatory accounting  costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate making purposes in future rates 
accordingly  we have recorded costs and obligations  which will be amortized over various future periods 
any change in the assessment of the probability of rate making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item 
we have no reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded will be treated differently by the regulators in the future 
revenues revenues from metered customers include amounts billed on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
the estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current climate and economic conditions 
differences between estimated revenues and actual billings are recorded in a subsequent period 
revenues from unmetered customers are billed at a fixed tariff rate in advance at the beginning of each service period and are recognized in revenue ratably over the service period 
revenues from the perth amboy management contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees 
fixed fees  which have been set for the life of the contract  are billed monthly and recorded as earned 
variable fees  which are based on billings and other factors and are not material  are recorded upon approval of the amount by perth amboy 
postemployment retirement benefit plans the costs for providing postemployment retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
future postemployment retirement benefit plan obligations and expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and 
index various other demographic factors related to the population participating in the company s postemployment retirement benefit plans  all of which can change significantly in future years 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension benefits which covers substantially all employees with more than  hours of service and who were hired prior to march  the company has a postretirement benefit plan other than pensions other benefits for substantially all of its retired employees 
employees hired after march  are not eligible to participate in this plan 
coverage includes healthcare and life insurance 
the allocation by asset category of postemployment employee benefit plan assets at december  and is as follows pension plan other benefits plan asset category target range equity securities debt securities cash commodities total the discount rate  compensation increase rate and long term rate of return utilized for determining our postemployment employee benefit plans future obligations as of december  are as follows pension plan other benefits plan discount rate compensation increase long term rate of return for  costs and obligations for our other benefits plan assumed a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits and assumed a decline of per year through and per year through  resulting in an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of by year the following is a sensitivity analysis for certain actuarial assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations pbo and expenses for our postemployment employee benefit plans pension plan actuarial assumptions estimated increase decrease on pbo s estimated increase decrease on expense s discount rate increase discount rate decrease 
index other benefits plan actuarial assumptions estimated increase decrease on pbo s estimated increase decrease on expense s discount rate increase discount rate decrease healthcare cost trend rate increase healthcare cost trend rate decrease the discount rates used at our december measurement date for determining future postemployment employee benefit plans obligations and costs are determined based on market rates for long term  high quality corporate bonds specific to our pension plan and other benefits plan s asset allocation 
the expected long term rate of return for pension plan and other benefits plan assets is determined based on historical returns and our asset allocation 
recent accounting standards see note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of existing long term debt instruments will mature 
applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on our earnings
