table of contents item a 
risk factors 
dollars in millions our business faces many risks 
we believe the risks described below outline the items of most concern to us 
however  these are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
deterioration of economic conditions the deterioration in economic conditions over the past two years has hurt our business in several ways 
rising unemployment  tightening of consumer credit and the decline in the housing market in the united states have all contributed to a reduction in consumer spending 
this has had a significant negative impact on our revenues 
we sell high quality apparel  shoes  cosmetics and accessories  which many consumers consider to be discretionary items 
during economic downturns  fewer customers may shop in our stores and on our web site  and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases  all of which may lead to lower sales  higher markdowns and increased marketing and promotional spending in response to lower demand 
the deterioration of economic conditions has also adversely affected our credit customers payment patterns and delinquency rates  increasing our bad debt expense 
while some macroeconomic indicators suggest that a modest economic recovery has begun  key factors such as employment levels  consumer credit and housing market conditions remain weak 
a sluggish economic recovery or a renewed downturn could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
ability to respond to the business environment and fashion trends we strive to ensure the merchandise we offer remains current and compelling to our customers 
we make decisions regarding inventory purchases well in advance of the season in which it will be sold 
therefore  our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends  consumer preferences and spending patterns  and to match our merchandise levels and mix to sales trends and consumer tastes  significantly impacts our sales and operating results 
if we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough  we may be forced to sell our merchandise at higher average markdown levels and lower average margins  which could harm our business 
conversely  if we fail to purchase enough merchandise  we may lose opportunities for additional sales and damage our relationships with our customers 
consumer credit our credit card operations help drive sales in our stores  allow our stores to avoid third party transaction fees and generate additional revenues by extending credit 
our credit card revenues and profitability are subject in large part to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control  including  but not limited to  interest rates  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  unemployment trends and other matters 
increases in unemployment have corresponded with rising credit card delinquencies and write offs  which may continue in the future 
further  these economic conditions could impair our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers if the criteria and or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses  which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
regulatory environment and financial system reforms current economic conditions  particularly in the financial markets  have resulted in increased legislative and regulatory actions 
the credit card accountability  responsibility and disclosure act of the credit card act included new rules and restrictions on credit card pricing  finance charges and fees  customer billing practices and payment application 
these provisions are likely to affect our credit business practices and could have a negative impact on our revenues and profitability 
in addition  congress and the obama administration are currently considering various proposals for reform of the financial system 
proposed reforms include the elimination of the thrift charter and all retailer owned bank charters  creation of a new federal agency to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations  and expanded state authority over consumer lending 
the final details of financial system reform legislation  if any  are highly uncertain at this time 
depending on the nature and extent of any reforms  our credit business could be significantly adversely affected 
leadership development and succession planning the training and development of our future leaders is important to our long term growth 
if we do not effectively implement our strategic and business planning processes to attract  retain  train and develop future leaders  our long term growth may suffer 
we rely on the experience of our senior management  who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace 
if unexpected leadership turnover occurs without adequate succession plans  the loss of the services of any of these individuals  or any negative perceptions of our business as a result of those losses  could damage our brand image and our business 
information security and privacy the protection of our customer  employee and company data is important to us 
the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding  with new and constantly changing requirements across our business units 
in addition  our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information 
a significant breach of customer  employee or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales  fines and lawsuits 
in addition  a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in disruption of our operations  particularly our online sales operations 
brand and reputation we have a well recognized brand that many consumers believe offers a high level of customer service and quality merchandise 
any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales  reduce employee morale and productivity  and diminish customer trust  any of which would harm our business 

table of contents store growth plans our five year strategic growth plan includes opening several new full line and rack stores  with announced store openings 
the majority of these openings will occur by we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores 
local land use and other regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations 
we also depend on the work of our developer partners to sustain our store growth plans 
developer delays of shopping center construction  expansion or renovation projects  or developer financial difficulties  could cause the delay or cancellation of our expected store openings or remodels  or could adversely affect maintenance and leasing at some shopping centers in which we have stores 
new store openings also involve certain risks  including constructing  furnishing and supplying a store in a timely and cost effective manner and accurately assessing the demographic or retail environment for a particular location 
our future sales at new  relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections  which could affect our return on investment 
performance in our new stores could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to hire employees who are able to deliver the level of service our customers have come to expect when shopping in our stores 
our inability to execute our store growth strategy in a way that generates appropriate returns on investment could affect our future growth and profitability 
information technology strategy we make investments in information technology to sustain our competitive position 
in  we expect to spend approximately on information technology operations and systems development  which is key to our growth 
we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace 
excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption  and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology 
targeting the wrong opportunities  failing to make the best investments  or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs may result in the loss of our competitive position 
in addition  if we do not maintain our current systems we may see interruptions to our business and increase our costs in order to bring our systems up to date 
multi channel strategy execution over the past several years  we have made changes in our business to improve the shopping experience across all channels 
these changes included aligning our online merchandise offering with our full line stores to create a seamless experience for our customers between our stores and web site  combining the full line stores and direct merchandise organizations  providing a more focused catalog offering  and creating a shared inventory platform between direct and our full line stores 
we plan to make additional changes in our multi channel merchandise planning process over the next few years 
if we encounter challenges associated with change management  the ability to hire and retain key personnel involved in these efforts  implementation of associated information technology  or adoption of new processes  our ability to continue to successfully execute this strategy could be adversely affected 
as a result  we may not derive the expected benefits to our sales and profitability  or we may incur increased costs relative to our current projections 
impact of competitive market forces the retail industry environment continues to change for many of our vendors and customers 
in the future  our competition may partner more effectively with vendors to serve consumers needs 
if we do not effectively respond to changes in our environment  we may see a loss of market share to competitors  declining sales and declining profitability due to higher markdowns 
our credit segment faces competition from large banks  and other credit card companies  some of which have substantial financial resources 
many of our competitors offer general purpose credit card products with a variety of loyalty programs 
in addition  there is intense competition for cardholders with prime credit ratings who make up a significant portion of our credit portfolio 
if we do not effectively respond to the competitive banking and credit card environment  we could lose market share to our competitors  which would have an adverse effect on our credit business 
capital management and liquidity our access to debt and equity capital  and our ability to invest capital to maximize the total returns to our shareholders  is critical to our long term success 
we utilize capital to finance our operations and working capital  make capital expenditures  manage our debt levels and return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
as a result of the financial crisis  global credit and equity markets have undergone significant disruption  making it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain capital and the cost of the capital depend on financial market conditions and independent rating agencies short and long term debt ratings  which are based largely on our performance as measured by credit metrics including interest coverage and leverage ratios 
if our access to capital is restricted or if our cost of capital increases  our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
further  if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns  our operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and our long term cost of capital could increase 
supply chain disruption the effective and efficient operation of our supply chain  including merchandise sourcing and procurement  receiving and distribution  is critical to the success of our business 
our supply chain operations may be adversely impacted by difficulties with our suppliers  such as production capacity constraints  errors in meeting merchandise specifications  including specifications dictated by consumer product safety laws  insufficient quality control  failures to meet production deadlines  or increases in manufacturing costs 
additionally  unforeseen disruptions in our supply chain due to severe weather  natural or man made disasters  labor disputes  shipping problems  or information systems malfunction  may adversely affect our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores or our customers and could increase our costs 
nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents relationships with vendors our relationships with our merchandise vendors have been a significant contributor to our past success and our position as a retailer of high quality fashion merchandise 
some of our vendors have experienced serious cash flow problems due to the credit market crisis and economic deterioration 
to address these problems  our vendors could attempt to increase their prices  alter payment terms or seek other relief  all of which could increase our costs 
in some cases  they may be forced to reduce their operations or file for bankruptcy protection  which could have an adverse effect on our business if we are unable to procure the desired merchandise on acceptable terms 
we also have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our key vendors  many of whom limit the number of retail channels they use to sell their merchandise 
competition to obtain and sell this merchandise is intense 
nearly all of the brands of our top vendors are sold by competing retailers  and many of our top vendors also have their own dedicated retail stores 
if one or more of our top vendors were to increase sales of merchandise through their own stores or to the stores of our competitors  or to limit or reduce our access to their merchandise  our business could be adversely affected 
geographic location of stores a significant amount of our total sales is derived from stores located on the west and east coasts  particularly california  which increases our exposure to local economic conditions  severe weather  natural disasters and other natural or man made disruptions within these regions 
deterioration in economic conditions and consumer confidence within these regions has negatively impacted our business  including a reduction in overall sales  reduced gross margins and increased expenses  including bad debt expense 
any continued economic deterioration  severe weather patterns  natural disasters or other disruptions in these regions  could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
in addition  many states in these regions are facing significant budget shortfalls  and may seek to address those shortfalls through unfavorable changes in tax laws and interpretation of existing laws which could adversely affect our results of operations 
employment laws and regulations our policies and procedures are designed to comply with employment laws and regulations set forth by the federal government and in each of the states and municipalities where we do business 
these include laws and regulations related to wages and hours  meals and rest periods  and commissions 
these laws and regulations are complex and continuously evolving  and the related enforcement is increasingly aggressive  particularly in the state of california 
significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations 
possible legislative changes include changes to an employer s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units  the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed and health care mandates 
in addition  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to damage to our reputation  class action lawsuits  legal and settlement costs  disruption of our business  changes to our employment practices  and loss of customers and employees  which could result in a loss of sales  increased employment costs  low employee morale  and harm to our business and results of operations 
regulatory compliance our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including those imposed by the sec  nyse  the banking industry and foreign countries 
additional legal and regulatory requirements  and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws  have increased the complexity of the regulatory environment and the cost of compliance 
failure to comply with the various regulations may result in damage to our reputation  civil and criminal liability  fines and penalties  increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements 
impact of public health concerns our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by a regional or widespread pandemic  which could cause  among other things  a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales  staffing shortages in our stores  distribution centers  or corporate offices  supply chain disruptions  or disruptions in the operations of our merchandise vendors or property developers 
any of these effects could have a significant adverse impact on our sales  costs  reputation and long term growth plans 
foreign currency we purchase a portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers whose cost to us is affected by fluctuations of their local currency against the us dollar or who price their merchandise in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold  and if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers  our gross margins  and ultimately our earnings  would decrease 
anti takeover provisions we are incorporated in the state of washington and subject to washington state law 
some provisions of washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us 
for example  one provision prohibits us  except under specified circumstances  from engaging in any significant business transaction with any shareholder who owns or more of our common stock an acquiring person for a period of five years following the time that the shareholder became an acquiring person

these enhancements have led to greater merchandise selections online  improved convenience  as well as significant improvements in our sell through rates the proportion of available merchandise that we are able to sell and inventory turnover 
our merchandising efforts have also been a significant contributor to our recent success 
by managing our inventory levels effectively during the economic downturn that began approximately two years ago  we were well positioned to increase purchases as sales improved and maintain fresh merchandise in our stores without taking excessive markdowns 
our customers have continued to respond favorably to our merchandise assortment  thereby contributing to additional sales growth and higher rates of regular priced sales 
throughout  we demonstrated discipline in the management of our expenses 
our model is focused on controlling our fixed expenses  while flexing our variable and performance related expenses with our sales and earnings results

consumers are cautious about spending  unemployment levels continue to be high and economic uncertainty remains 
as a result of these conditions  we experienced elevated delinquency and write off rates on our credit card portfolio 
we expect unemployment levels will remain elevated during we recognize the importance of increasing our presence in top retail markets across the country 
during we opened three nordstrom full line stores  relocated another  and opened nordstrom racks 
in we will continue to open full line and rack stores while returning to a more regular remodeling schedule of five to six in  compared to one remodel in  as we continue to pursue our long term growth strategy 
we entered with considerable uncertainty  including an economic downturn and a volatile retail environment

our merchandising efforts also contributed to our improving multi channel sales trends during the second half of the year

highlights for the year included both women s shoes and accessories

retail business gross profit fiscal year gross profit gross profit rate average inventory per square foot inventory turnover rate gross profit is calculated as net sales less retail business cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs 
gross profit rate is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales 
inventory turnover rate is calculated as annual cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs for all segments divided by quarter average inventory 
gross profit vs retail gross profit increased from last year while our gross profit rate improved basis points compared with the same period in retail gross profit consists of merchandise margin offset by buying and occupancy costs 
the improvement for the year was driven by overall improvement in our merchandise margin  particularly in the second half of the year 
the latter half of was highly promotional among retailers  meaning many competitors took steep markdowns and or offered special events or incentives to attract customers  as sales declined 
we were able to be less promotional and reduce markdowns during  particularly during the second half of the year  by aligning inventory with sales trends 
all major merchandise categories at our full line stores contributed to this improvement over the improvement in our merchandise margin was offset by an increase in our buying and occupancy costs 
buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales increased basis points 
this increase was primarily driven by incentives that were a result of strong company performance relative to our plans for our inventory turnover rate increased over last year while our average inventory per square foot decreased 
our merchandising efforts have enabled us to manage inventory levels consistent with sales trends and maintain fresh merchandise in our stores 
combined with the increased sell through resulting from our improved multi channel inventory capabilities  these efforts led to a significant increase in our inventory turnover rate 
gross profit vs retail gross profit in decreased from while our gross profit rate declined basis points 
the deterioration in was driven primarily by a decrease in our merchandise margin rate as we utilized markdowns to respond to slower sales and a more promotional environment 
all major merchandise categories at our full line stores contributed to this decrease 
our buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales increased basis points as many of these costs were fixed relative to the sales decline 
our inventory turnover rate improved slightly in while our average inventory per square foot decreased 
our merchants efforts to align inventory levels to lower demand resulted in the improvement in our inventory turnover rate and our lower inventory per square foot 
our objective was to match the change in inventory per square foot  which declined on average  with our same store sales rate  which declined for the year 
gross profit outlook in  we expect a to basis point improvement in our total company gross profit rate  which includes both our retail gross profit and our cost of loyalty points within our credit segment 
we expect greater improvement in the first half of the year when compared to  when weaker sales trends in the first and second quarters increased markdown pressure 
the improvement will be partially offset by additional occupancy expense for the three new full line and seventeen new rack stores in retailers do not uniformly record the costs of buying and occupancy and supply chain operations freight  purchasing  receiving  distribution  etc

selling  general and administrative expenses vs our retail business selling  general and administrative expenses retail sg a increased due to increased performance related incentives  partially offset by lower variable expenses and cost savings resulting from controlling our fixed costs 
we increased our provision for performance related expense as the year progressed to reflect the improved performance of our overall business relative to our plan 
this reflects our pay for performance approach to compensation 
our variable expenses decreased in conjunction with lower sales volume  and we worked diligently to maintain our discipline in managing fixed costs 
during  we opened three full line stores and thirteen rack stores  which contributed of additional expenses 
although we opened more stores compared to  the majority were rack stores  which incur lower expenses than a full line store 
these drivers led our retail sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales to be approximately flat versus last year

table of contents credit segment the nordstrom credit card products are designed to strengthen customer relationships and grow retail sales by providing valuable services  loyalty benefits and payment products 
we believe that owning our credit card business allows us to fully integrate our rewards program with our retail stores and provide better service to our customers  thus deepening our relationship with them and driving greater customer loyalty 
cardholders can participate in the nordstrom fashion rewards program  through which customers accumulate points based on their level of spending generally two points per dollar spent at nordstrom and one point per dollar spent outside of nordstrom 
upon reaching two thousand points  customers receive twenty dollars in nordstrom notes  which can be redeemed for goods or services in our stores 
as customers increase their level of spending they receive additional benefits  including rewards such as complimentary shipping and alterations in our retail stores 
our cardholders tend to visit our stores more frequently and spend more with us than non cardholders 
we believe the fashion rewards program  including these additional rewards  helps drive sales in our retail stores and direct segments 
the table below illustrates a detailed view of the operational results of our credit segment  consistent with the segment disclosure provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to view the economic contribution of our credit card program  the following items are also included in the table below intercompany merchant fees represent the estimated intercompany income of our credit business from the usage of our cards in the retail stores and direct segments 
to encourage the use of nordstrom cards in our stores  the credit segment does not charge the retail stores and direct segments an intercompany interchange merchant fee 
on a consolidated basis  we avoid costs that would be incurred if our customers used third party cards 
during  we combined our nordstrom private label credit card and nordstrom visa credit card programs into one securitization program

the average accounts receivable investment metric included in the following table represents our best estimate of the amount of capital for our credit card program that is financed by equity 
as a means of assigning a comparable cost of capital for our credit card business  we believe it is important to maintain a capital structure similar to other financial institutions 
based on our research  debt as a percentage of credit card receivables for other credit card companies ranges from to

interchange fees are earned from the use of nordstrom visa credit cards at merchants outside of nordstrom 
credit card revenues increased to in compared with in due to an increase in our annual percentage rate terms implemented in the fourth quarter of  growth in our accounts receivable balance and increased finance charges and late fees associated with increased delinquencies during the economic downturn 
the increase in credit card revenues from in to in was in part due to the nordstrom visa portfolio being on balance sheet for a full year in fiscal compared to only three quarters in fiscal the increase was also due to portfolio growth and the change in our credit card pricing terms implemented in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a significant reduction in the average prime rate 

table of contents in  credit card revenues are expected to increase to  due to moderate growth in our accounts receivable 
in may  the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the credit card act was passed 
in january  final rules implementing portions of the credit card act were issued  including new restrictions on credit card pricing  finance charges and fees  customer billing practices and payment application 
these rules are requiring us to make changes to our credit card business practices and systems 
we have completed and implemented the necessary changes and new procedures to enable compliance with those rules that had a mandatory effective date of february  however  the credit card act s full impact on our business is unknown at this time 
additional proposed rules implementing other portions of the credit card act  effective in august  were published in early march  and interpretations of the new and proposed rules continue to emerge 
depending on the nature and extent of the full impact from these rules  any interpretations or additional rules  the practices  revenues and profitability of our credit business could be adversely affected 
interest expense decreased to in from in and in these year over year decreases were due to declining variable interest rates  partially offset by higher average borrowings 
credit segment cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs  which includes the estimated cost of nordstrom notes that will be issued and redeemed under our fashion rewards program  increased to in compared with in the increase was primarily due to increased use of nordstrom credit cards  resulting in additional expense related to the fashion rewards program

table of contents return on invested capital roic non gaap financial measure we define return on invested capital roic as follows roic net operating profit after taxes nopat average invested capital we believe that roic is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented 
when read in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets and compared to return on assets  it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period 
roic is one of our key financial metrics  and we also incorporate it into our executive incentive measures 
our research has shown that  historically  overall performance as measured by roic correlates directly to shareholders return over the long term 
for the fiscal months ended january   our roic increased to compared to for the fiscal months ended january  roic is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  should not be considered a substitute for return on assets  net earnings or total assets as determined in accordance with gaap  and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

based upon the trailing month average for accounts payable  accrued salaries  wages and related benefits  and other current liabilities 
based upon the trailing month average of the monthly asset base  which is calculated as the trailing months rent expense multiplied by our roic increased primarily due to an increase in our earnings before interest and income taxes compared to the prior year  offset by an increase in our average invested capital attributable primarily to growth in cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to maintain appropriate levels of short term borrowings 
we believe that our operating cash flows and available credit facilities are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for the next months and beyond

we continuously assess our debt and leverage levels  capital expenditure requirements  debt service payments  dividend payouts  potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions 
we believe our existing cash on hand  operating cash flows  available credit facilities and potential future borrowings will be sufficient to fund these scheduled future payments and potential long term initiatives

operating cash outflows also include payments for income taxes and interest payments on our short and long term borrowings 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared with was due to working capital initiatives and improved earnings 
the positive impact from the change in accrued salaries  wages and related benefits primarily reflects the increase in performance related expenses as our overall results improved relative to our plans in that will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal year in  although we expect net earnings to increase  we expect our operating cash flows to decline 
this is a result of increases in working capital to support sales growth and payment of performance related expenses that were included in accrued salaries  wages and related benefits at the end of investing activities net cash used in investing activities was in and in our investing cash flows primarily consist of capital expenditures and  beginning in the second quarter of when we brought our nordstrom visa credit card receivables on balance sheet  customer purchases net of payments for goods and services outside of nordstrom using the nordstrom visa credit cards 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures over the last three years totaled  with in  in and in compared with  capital expenditures declined as we opened fewer full line stores in while we opened more rack stores in compared with  the investment to open a rack store is significantly less than a full line store

we expect that our capital expenditures net of property incentives will be approximately  over the next five years  with approximately to in over these five years  we plan to use of this investment to build new and relocated stores  on remodels major and minor  on information technology and for other projects 
our current five year plans include new stores announced through  and two announced with dates to be determined  which represents a increase in square footage 
almost one third of these stores will be in the south 
we believe that we have the capacity for additional capital investments should opportunities arise 
change in credit card receivables originated at third parties the nordstrom visa credit cards allow our customers to make purchases at merchants outside of nordstrom and accumulate points for our nordstrom fashion rewards 
in  we experienced a decrease in third party purchases made by our customers using their nordstrom visa credit cards 
this decrease was driven by reductions in general consumer spending in response to economic conditions during this caused a decrease in cash used for accounts receivable originating at third parties  which was in compared with in financing activities our net cash provided by financing activities was in compared with used in financing activities in our financing activities include our short term and long term borrowing activity  dividends paid  and repurchases of common stock

table of contents we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission 
under the terms of the registration statement  and subject to the filing of certain post effective amendments  we are authorized to issue an unlimited principal amount of debt securities 
our next debt maturity is a securitized note due in april beginning in the first quarter of  we will make monthly cash deposits into a restricted account until the note is due in accordance with the debt agreement 
we will continue to monitor the credit markets and our potential financing needs in order to ensure we have adequate cash on hand to pay this debt when it becomes due 
we expect to retire the securitized note with available cash when it matures 
debt covenants our unsecured line of credit requires that we maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than four times adjusted debt to ebitdar  and a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least two times 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as ebitdar less gross capital expenditures interest expense  net rent expense as of january  and january  we were in compliance with these covenants 
we will continue to monitor these covenants to ensure that we make any necessary adjustments to our plans and believe that we will remain in compliance with these covenants during see additional disclosure of adjusted debt to ebitdar on the following page 
the following table shows our credit ratings at the date of this report standard credit ratings moody s and poor s senior unsecured debt baa bbb commercial paper p a senior unsecured outlook stable positive these ratings could change depending on our performance and other factors 
our variable funding facility can be cancelled or not renewed if our debt ratings fall below standard and poor s bb rating or moody s ba rating 
our other outstanding debt is not subject to termination or interest rate adjustments based on changes in our credit ratings 
we are currently three ratings above the minimum for our standard and poor s covenant requirements  and two ratings above the minimum for our moody s covenant requirements 

table of contents adjusted debt to ebitdar non gaap financial measure we define adjusted debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar as follows adjusted debt to ebitdar adjusted debt ebitdar adjusted debt to ebitdar is one of our key financial metrics  and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure 
our current goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment grade credit rating as well as operate with an efficient capital structure for our size  growth plans and industry 
investment grade credit ratings are important to maintaining access to a variety of short term and long term sources of funding  and we rely on these funding sources to continue to grow our business 
we believe a higher ratio  among other factors  could result in rating agency downgrades 
in contrast  we believe a lower ratio would result in a higher cost of capital and could negatively impact shareholder returns 
as of both january  and january   our adjusted debt to ebitdar was adjusted debt to ebitdar is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net earnings  net earnings or debt as determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  adjusted debt to ebitdar does have limitations adjusted debt is not exact  but rather our best estimate of the total company debt we would hold if we had purchased the property and issued debt associated with our operating leases  ebitdar does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  including leases  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted debt to ebitdar differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
to compensate for these limitations  we analyze adjusted debt to ebitdar in conjunction with other gaap financial and performance measures impacting liquidity  including operating cash flows  capital spending and net earnings 
the closest gaap measure is debt to net earnings  which was and for and  respectively 
the following is a reconciliation of debt to net earnings and adjusted debt to ebitdar debt add rent expense x adjusted debt net earnings add income tax expense add interest expense  net earnings before interest and income taxes add depreciation and amortization of buildings and equipment add rent expense ebitdar debt to net earnings adjusted debt to ebitdar the components of adjusted debt are as of the end of and  while the components of ebitdar are for the months ended january  and january  debt included of commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of january  there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings as of january  the multiple of eight times rent expense used to calculate adjusted debt is our best estimate of the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease  or if we had purchased the property

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows as of january  we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and credit available to us under existing and potential future facilities 
less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations other long term liabilities operating leases purchase obligations total included in the required debt repayments disclosed above are estimated total interest payments of  as of january   payable over the remaining life of the debts 
other long term liabilities consist of workers compensation and general liability insurance reserves and postretirement benefits 
the repayment amounts presented above were estimated based on historical payment trends 
other long term liabilities not requiring cash payments  such as deferred property incentives and deferred revenue  were excluded from the table above 
also excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash payments for these liabilities 
purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for unreceived goods or services and capital expenditure commitments 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures that follow 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in our nordstrom private label card and nordstrom visa credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on several factors  including historical trends of aging of accounts  write off experience and expectations of future performance  including trends in unemployment rates 
we recognize finance charges on delinquent accounts until the account is written off 
we write off credit card loans when accounts are  at a minimum  days contractually delinquent 
accounts relating to cardholder bankruptcies  cardholder deaths and fraudulent transactions are written off earlier 
management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations 
recent increases in unemployment and associated delinquency and write off trends have prompted us to record significant increases to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which increased from at january  to at january  a change in our allowance for doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by for the fiscal year ended january  revenue recognition we record sales net of estimated returns and we exclude sales taxes 
we recognize revenue from sales at our retail stores at the point of sale 
revenue from our online and catalog sales includes shipping revenue and is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer 
we estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly 
although we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns  there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts 
in the past three years  we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve 
a change in the sales return reserve would have had a impact on our net earnings for the year ended january  
table of contents inventory our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory 
to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin 
among others  the significant estimates used in inventory valuation are obsolescence and shrinkage 
we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of net sales for the period from the most recent semi annual inventory count based on historical shrinkage results 
therefore  our obsolescence reserve and shrinkage percentage contain uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
we do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience 
in the past three years  we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence and shrinkage reserves 
a change in the obsolescence reserve or our shrink percentage would not have a material effect on our net earnings 
income taxes we calculate income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and respective tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which we expect those temporary differences to reverse 
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 
in the past three years we have not recorded any valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal  state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts  circumstances and information available to us 
if we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained  we recognize a benefit at the largest amount which we believe is cumulatively greater than likely to be realized 
our unrecognized tax benefit was as of january  and as of january  deferred tax asset valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits  and our particular facts and circumstances 
also  as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse  it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable  deferred tax assets  tax reserves or income tax expense 
such adjustments reduced our effective income tax rate by percentage points in and percentage points in recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect any of these pronouncements to have a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources as they primarily address financial statement disclosures

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in millions interest rate risk our primary exposure to market risk is through changes in interest rates 
as of january   we have gross trade receivables of  which generate finance charge income at a combination of fixed and variable rates  and long term debt of  including  that bears interest at libor based rates 
changing interest rates can therefore affect our credit card revenues and interest expense 
the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in interest rates would not materially affect our net earnings  cash flows  or the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
we manage our net interest rate exposure through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings and associated current and long term assets 
from time to time  we may also enter into interest rate swap transactions for purposes of hedging the exposure of changes in fair value of our long term debt from interest rate risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
the table below presents information about our long term debt obligations and interest rate swaps that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of january  for debt obligations  including our capital leases  the table presents principal amounts  at book value  by maturity date  and related weighted average interest rates
