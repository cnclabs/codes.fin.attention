item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction we are an exploratory stage mining company that currently has mining concessions in mexico and and the sleeper mine in nevada  usa 
we have no proven reserves at san miguel but are currently exploring the project 
we are also preparing to commence an exploratory and metallurgical program at the sleeper gold property in nevada 
comparison of operating results for the year ended june  as compared to june  revenues we are an exploratory mining company with no revenues from operations to date 
all of our revenues to date represent interest income which we have earned as a result of our cash holdings 
our cash holdings were generated from the sale of our securities 
interest income for the year ended june  were  as compared to  for the year ended june  interest income since inception totals  interest income decreased by approximately from the prior year 
the significant decrease in our interest income is primarily due to lower interest rates offered for short term investments 
our funds are deposited in an interest bearing account subject to transfer to our operating account to meet ongoing expenses 
we intend to utilize our cash reserves for ongoing exploration activities  land acquisitions and gen eral working capital expenditures 
operating expenses we incurred expenses totaling  as compared to  for the year ended  an increase of approximately million 
for the year ended june   we incurred exploration costs of  compared to  in the previous year 
the increase was due to a significant increase in exploration activity which included planning  target development  drilling and testing at our san miguel project in mexico 
expenses for professional fees  corporate communications and consulting fees were   and  compared to the previous year of   and  respectively 
the decline from the previous year is a result of headcount reduction and streamlining of all corporate functions 
the acquisition expenses of  were a result of legal  advisory and due diligence cost related to our proposed merger with klondex mines ltd 
and our acquisition of x cal resources ltd 
net income loss our net loss for the year ended june  was  as compared to a net loss of  in our prior year 
our net loss per share was as compared to a net loss per share of for the comparable periods in the decline in our net loss per share is directly attributable to an increase in the number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for was  as compared to  for until such time as we are able to identify mineral deposits which we believe can be extracted in a commercially reasonable manner  of which there can be no assurance  we anticipate that we will continue to incur ongoing losses 
liquidity and capital resources assets and liabilities  at june  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  as compared to  at june   an increase of approximately million 
the significant increase in our cash reserves is a direct result of an underwritten public offering of our securities by dahlman rose company for net proceeds of approximately million in october and from the exercise of warrants in january and june accounts receivable increased from  at june  to  at june  the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to value added tax owed by the mexican government related to our increased exploration activities at our san miguel project 
also  our term deposit of  at june  came to term prior to j une  and was re invested in a cash equivalent gic 
we had total current assets of  at june  as compared to  at june   an increase of approximately 
our mineral properties were valued as of june  at  as compared to  at june   an increase of approximately million 
also during the past year  we have written off  attributable to vidette lake as a result of terminating our option on this property 
total assets at june  were  as compared to  at june   an increase of approximately due to significant financings and mineral property purchases 
our current liabilities as of june  totaled  as compared to  at june  the increase in current liabilities is almost all attributable to the addition this year of a warrant liability of  due to warrants with exercise prices valued in canadian funds 
we did not record a similar liability last year as we did not adopt the amended provisions of asc on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of the scope exception in asc until july   which is the date at which this amendment becomes effective 
the warrant liability is a non cash item and only obligates the company to issue common shares if exercised by the holder of the warrant prior to expiry 
we have a working capital surplus of  as compared to a working capital surplus of  at june  we believe that our working capital surplus will enable us to meet our anticipated drilling for several fiscal years and operational needs  subject to any costs that we incur with respect to the acquisition of additional mineral properties 
acquisition of additional mineral properties may require a cash infusion from either debt or equity financing  of which there can be no assurance 
results of operations for the year ended june  with respect to our short term liquidity  our current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities as of june  was to compared to to at june  this decrease is a result of adopting fasb asc in where the company records its outstanding warrant and options with strike prices denominated in canadian dollars as a current liability as opposed to equity 
the current ratio excluding the non cash warrant liability of  is to the current ratio is commonly used as a measure of a company s liquidity 
our management believes  however  that with a company still in the exploratory stage  the ratio may not be as significant as with an ongoing business in comparing the company with others in the industry 
in analyzing our liq uidity  we look at actual dollars  we compare our cash on hand and other short term assets with our bills payable and other short term obligations 
since our only source of funds has been from the periodic sale of securities  it will be very difficult for us to meet our current and anticipated obligations for a significant period of time without raising additional capital 
if we are not able to raise adequate capital and to do so in a timely manner  we will not be able to fully implement our business plan or sustain ongoing operations 
if and when we are able to begin production  which is highly uncertain  we will make an evaluation to determine whether cash reserves should be established or other steps taken to minimize possible adverse consequences due to environmental matters 
such evaluation will consider  among other factors  the land or other sources from which the raw materials are taken and the land upon which the processing is done  the nature of any chemicals used in the processing  and the nature  extent  and means of disposition of the residue from the processing 
since our inception  we have funded our activities by issuing common stock 
although we will continue periodically to seek external sources of funds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations 
if we do raise equity capital  depending on the number of shares issued and the issue price of the shares  current stockholders interests may be diluted 
the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes that the company will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business 
the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company s ability to generate profitable operations in the future  to maintain adequate financing  and to achieve a positive cash flow 
there is no assurance it will be able to meet any or all of such goals 
plan of operation exploration our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to focus our exploratory efforts on both the san miguel project in mexico and our recently acquired sleeper gold mine in nevada  usa as part of our acquisition of x cal resources 

it is very difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty the extent of our drilling program for we have budgeted million for our drilling program in mexico and million for nevada 
a portion of our working capital may be utilized to acquire additional mineral properties in which case we will have to carefully manage our exploratory program to preserve capital 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the sec  encourages all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and long lived assets 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we review the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property  if any  exceeds its fair market value 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting and according to the provision of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for development stage enterprises  as it was devoting substantially all of its efforts to acquiring and exploring mineral properties 
it is industry practice that mining companies in the development stage are classified under generally accepted accounting principles as exploration stage companies 
until such properties are acquired and developed  the company will continue to prepare its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with entities in the exploration or development stage 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  under the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r eliminates accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method prescribed under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
under the modified prospective method  we are required to recognize compensation cost for share based payments to employees based on their grant date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied 
for periods prior to adoption  the financial statements are unchanged  and the pro forma disclosures previously required by sf as no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 will continue to be required under sfas no 
r to the extent those amounts differ from those in the consolidated statement of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not anticipate entering into any off balance sheet arrangements during the next months
