overview applied provides manufacturing equipment  services and software to the global semiconductor  flat panel display  solar photovoltaic pv and related industries 
applied s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips  flat panel liquid crystal displays lcds  solar pv cells and modules  and other electronic devices 
these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components 
applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group  applied global services  display  and energy and environmental solutions 
product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in north america  europe  israel and asia 
applied s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 
applied s results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
each of applied s businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions  as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips  lcds  solar pvs and other electronic devices  as well as other factors  such as global economic and market conditions  and technological advances in fabrication processes 
after a challenging year in fiscal that was characterized by credit constraints in the financial markets  a weak global economy and a semiconductor industry downturn  global economic and industry conditions affecting applied s businesses generally improved in fiscal  except for conditions in the thin film solar pv market 
the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years change fiscal year over over in millions  except per share amounts and percentages new orders net sales gross margin gross margin percent points points operating income loss operating margin percent points points net income loss earnings loss per share 
table of contents financial results for fiscal over fiscal reflected significantly increased demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to more favorable global economic and industry conditions 
the increase in total orders from fiscal was primarily due to increased demand for semiconductor  display and crystalline silicon c si solar pv products  partially offset by decreased demand for sunfab tm thin film solar lines

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued updated authoritative guidance that amends the requirements for evaluating whether a decision maker or service provider has a variable interest entity and clarified that a quantitative approach should not be the sole consideration in assessing the criteria for variable interest entity determination 
the guidance also clarifies that related parties should be considered in applying all of the decision maker and service provider criteria 
this is in addition to the authoritative guidance the fasb issued in june that applies to determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and requiring an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
under this guidance  an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
the guidance also requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  requires enhanced disclosures  and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying special purpose entities 
this authoritative guidance is effective for applied beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on applied s financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements  which requires additional disclosures and clarifications to existing disclosures 
this authoritative guidance requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers 
this authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in level fair value measurements 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures for level and level fair value measurements became effective for applied in the second quarter of fiscal disclosures regarding activity within level fair value measurements become effective the first interim reporting period after december  and will be effective for applied in the second quarter of fiscal applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements

factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis  the financial condition  credit quality and near term prospects of the investee  and whether it is more likely than not that applied will be required to sell the security prior to any anticipated recovery in fair value

applied also has operating leases for various facilities 
total rental expense for operating leases was million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied s contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt obligations interest expense associated with long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities represents applied s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied s a outstanding purchase orders for goods and services  and b contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods 
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  the company has certain tax obligations

as of october   the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were million as of october  and million as of october  all million in interest and penalties is classified as long term payable in the consolidated balance sheets 
at this time  the company is unable to make a 
table of contents reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and  accordingly  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties include those discussed in part ii  item a  risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  seller s price to buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements 
in addition  applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables 
judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units 
moreover  judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period 
while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement  any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition  which could have a material effect on applied s financial condition and results of operations 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and certain software sold with tangible products 
this new guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of management s best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific evidence or third party evidence is unavailable 
applied implemented this guidance prospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal for transactions that were initiated or materially modified during fiscal the implementation of the new guidance had an insignificant impact on reported net sales as compared to net sales under previous guidance  as the new guidance did not change the units of accounting within sales arrangements and the elimination of the residual method for the allocation of arrangement consideration had an inconsequential impact on the amount and timing of reported net sales 

table of contents warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product  current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
applied s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on historical experience  credit evaluations  specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues applied has identified 
changes in circumstances  such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends  may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital 
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment  especially in emerging markets 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a 
table of contents valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied s expectations could have a material impact on applied s results of operations and financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk applied s investment portfolio includes fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion at october  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on applied s investment portfolio at october   an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately million 
while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated condensed statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporary 
certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel  taiwanese dollar and swiss franc 
applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses were not material for fiscal
