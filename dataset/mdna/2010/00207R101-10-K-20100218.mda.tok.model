we also focus on partnering with customers to bring new technologies into high volume production as quickly and efficiently as possible 
atmi plans to continue to focus on leveraging our core technologies to create new high growth product lines  including growing our leadership position in advanced interconnect applications  which today is focused on copper 
we believe we also have achieved a leadership position in the small but fast growing market for one time use mixing applications in the life sciences market 
semiconductor industry background the semiconductor industry has experienced periods of rapid growth  but has also experienced downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  and high inventory levels 
the most recent downturn in the semiconductor industry began during the second half of  driven by broader macroeconomic deterioration  in particular in the credit and financial markets 
as was widely reported starting in late  the disruptions in global credit and financial markets led to diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  declines in economic growth  increases in unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
in response to these events and the uncertainty they caused  our customers cautiously managed their inventories 
in the second half of  the industry began to recover  driven by customers who had reduced their inventory levels in the face of the economic downturn and government sponsored demand generation programs 
as this recovery gained momentum our quarterly sequential results improved through we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions and the resultant effect on the semiconductor industry 

table of contents historically  longer term demand for semiconductor devices has grown as the use of semiconductor devices proliferated in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products  especially in computing  gaming  networking and communications equipment 
in periods of growth  demand for semiconductor devices has been fueled by the ability of semiconductor manufacturers to deliver products with consistently enhanced performance characteristics and functionality  improved reliability  reduced size  weight  power consumption and cost  and shorter product development cycles 
these past advances have been made possible  in part  by innovations in the fabrication processes and in the materials and delivery systems used in manufacturing advanced semiconductor devices 
at the same time  semiconductor manufacturers have continually sought to streamline their supplier relationships while the construction and management of fabrication facilities have become more complex and costly 
because of this trend  consolidation among the providers of semiconductor materials and materials delivery systems is expected to continue 
semiconductor manufacturing process semiconductor devices are manufactured by repeating a complex series of process steps on a wafer substrate usually made of silicon 
the primary process steps include various kinds of materials deposition physical vapor deposition  chemical vapor deposition  electrochemical deposition  atomic layer deposition  and ion implantation  etch  wafer preparation chemical mechanical planarization  patterning photolithography  and cleaning photoresist stripping  each of which is described in more detail below 
the industry is being revolutionized by the transformation from aluminum wiring to copper wiring in advanced semiconductor chips 
copper wiring requires many new materials to be developed  such as barriers and insulators  planarization materials  pre and post deposition cleaners  pre and post chemical mechanical planarization cmp cleaners  and post etch photoresist and post strip residue removers 
each new layer of copper generates a need for additional new materials 
as the migration to copper continues  many in the industry are predicting that the number of steps required to produce a chip will significantly increase  driving the need for as many as fifty to sixty new materials to be developed in support of this change 
during deposition processes  several layers of conducting  semi conducting  or insulating thin films are formed on a wafer 
precise and reliable control of the deposition of these films is vital to the ultimate performance of an individual device 
the most mature processes for thin film deposition and modification are physical vapor deposition  also known as pvd or sputtering  and ion implantation 
in pvd  which is used primarily for the deposition of conducting metal layers  a high energy beam is directed at a high purity metal target which in turn causes the displacement of metal atoms that are showered over the wafer  coating it with a thin metallic film 
ion implantation is a gas based process used principally to modify or dope semi conducting layers with a high energy beam of material that is implanted into an existing thin film 
chemical vapor deposition  or cvd  is a process used in the deposition of semiconducting and insulating thin films 
in the cvd process  wafers are placed in a sophisticated reaction chamber where specially designed gases or vaporized liquid materials are introduced 
simultaneously  a form of energy  such as heat or plasma  is added to the chamber to cause a chemical reaction among the materials being introduced 
as a result of this reaction  a thin film of material is deposited on the surface of the wafer 
cvd based processes have certain advantages over pvd based processes  including the relative thinness of the films applied to the wafer  conformality ability to coat evenly  especially in three dimensional holes and trenches designed into the device  
table of contents purity  and the ability to coat large areas 
these advantages have led to periods of growth in sales of reactors and related cvd process consumables and equipment 
consumables and related equipment include the raw materials used in the cvd process and the delivery systems required to transport the materials around a semiconductor plant and to a reactor 
electrochemical deposition  or ecd  is growing rapidly as a result of the industry s desire to use copper as the conducting layer in certain devices 
the use of copper allows for smaller circuits  because copper greatly reduces power consumption while increasing integrated circuit ic speed 
nature favors copper over aluminum wiring because of its higher conductivity and greater resistance to thermally and electrically induced short circuits 
in ecd  the wafer is placed in a bath of copper electroplating solution the electrolyte 
a power supply is connected from the wafer substrate to a solid copper anode 
when current is applied  the wafer acts as a cathode where copper is reduced from solution and deposited onto the wafer resulting in a thin film of copper on the wafer 
atomic layer deposition ald is a deposition method in which deposition of each atomic layer of material is controlled by a pre deposited layer of precursor  precursors and various components of the film are introduced alternately  this method is used in deposition of alternative dielectrics 
etch is a process that selectively erodes away certain thin film materials 
it is carried out either dry with corrosive gases or wet with energized liquids 
cmp is used to prepare a wafer for patterning photolithography 
as wafers are processed  thin film thicknesses vary across the surface of the wafer 
because of the fine line widths used in photolithography  wafers need to have more consistent topography 
cmp planarizes the processed wafer by polishing the wafer using a mechanical polishing pad and slurry  an abrasive solution containing abrasive particles and liquids and chemicals which selectively erode away the appropriate excess materials 
given the migration to copper  precision surface preparation and cleaning materials become more critical in the fabrication of advanced interconnect devices 
photolithography is the process whereby patterns are developed on the wafer surface 
the process is begun by applying a photosensitive material called photoresist or resist onto the wafer surface and shining light through a patterned photomask to selectively harden the resist 
photoresist strip is the process of stripping away or otherwise removing excess resist material which allows for the fabrication of the wafer s circuitry 
because thin film materials are consumables  the market for these materials  materials packaging  and materials delivery systems generally tracks wafer starts 
the thin film materials market is also segmented into a wide variety of material types and forms 
for example  many thin film precursors are now sold as pressurized gases  which allows for easy transport around a typical semiconductor manufacturing plant 
however  many of these gases are toxic and or hazardous  leading to the development of safer alternatives  including the use of liquid or solid materials and the adoption of gas handling technologies and delivery systems that minimize the danger of a catastrophic release of toxic gas 
in addition  many of the materials used are complex compounds that have stability issues related to the form and environment in which they are made  stored and used 
innovations in material selection  manufacturing  packaging and delivery are required to insure reliable supply of consistently pure materials 
the extraordinarily precise process requirements for making integrated circuits dictate exceptional purity and consistency requirements in the materials used to fabricate semiconductors 
liquids and solids used in making devices require special packaging and dispensing solutions to minimize exposure to air  contamination  and degradation during temperature fluctuations and varying process conditions 

table of contents the market for semiconductor thin film materials has expanded and contracted with the growth and contractions of the market for semiconductor devices 
the design of new thin film materials  materials packaging  and materials delivery systems to transport these materials around a semiconductor plant undergoes continuous innovation 
this innovation has been driven by the demand for expanding semiconductor device capabilities and corresponding decreases in circuit dimensions 
while we do expect growth in this segment  our growth may not track wafer starts as our customers continue to focus on improving their own manufacturing processes  which may result in less material used per wafer processed 
flat panel industry background the flat panel industry has experienced periods of rapid growth  but is also exposed to rapid downturns in anticipation of maturing product cycles  reductions in consumer demand and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  and high inventory levels 
as was widely reported starting in late  the disruptions in global credit and financial markets led to diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  declines in economic growth  increases in unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
in response to these events and the uncertainty they caused  our customers cautiously managed their inventories 
through the course of  the flat panel industry began to recover  driven by customers who had reduced their inventory levels in the face of the economic downturn and government sponsored demand generation programs 
given lingering economic uncertainties  we are unable to predict the likely duration of government sponsored demand generation and lower inventory levels 
flat panel displays have become the standard for computer monitors  hand held consumer devices  televisions  and commercial display applications 
similar to semiconductors  the demand for flat panel displays has been fueled by the ability of manufacturers to deliver products with consumer affordability through manufacturing and materials cost efficiencies  improved performance and reliability  and shorter product development cycles 
the advances in flat panel display technology have been made possible because manufacturers have learned to leverage many of the technologies developed for the semiconductor industry as well as improve processes that are unique to the flat panel display industry  such as slit coating instead of spin coating material onto the substrate to dramatically reduce material usage per substrate processed 
in some cases  because of the large volume of materials used in flat panel manufacturing  rapid advances in liquid materials handling and dispense applications have also contributed to manufacturing efficiencies 
like the semiconductor industry  construction and management of fabrication facilities have become more complex and costly  and flat panel display manufacturers continue to search for opportunities to bring efficiencies to their process to meet the increasing demand for lower cost consumer products 
flat panel manufacturing process flat panel display manufacturing is fundamentally similar to semiconductor manufacturing with a manufacturing cycle that includes photolithography and deposition process steps 
the primary difference is the size of the substrate with which the devices are made 
whereas the semiconductor industry has standardized on inch mm silicon wafers as the leading technology  flat panel display manufacturers work with glass panels as large as ten feet across or more  which can cause unique challenges in product handling 
the scale of flat panel manufacturing also leads to the requirement for larger volumes of materials and  although capital costs are rapidly increasing  materials remain a significant cost of manufacturing 
as such  performance materials  materials packaging  and materials delivery solutions that provide manufacturing process efficiencies are in demand 
while we do expect growth in this segment  our growth will not track glass starts as our customers are moving to larger package sizes that generate less packaging revenue per liter of material packaged and our customers continued focus on improving their own manufacturing processes result in less material used per substrate processed 

table of contents life sciences industry background for several decades  the pipeline for new drugs was dominated by small molecule based drugs or drugs manufactured from synthetic chemical molecules 
in the last few years there has been a shift in the pipeline of the most promising drugs to large molecule based drugs  or drugs manufactured through biotechnology processes 
in addition  the pipeline contains fewer blockbuster drugs ie  drugs with more than billion of revenues per year and more niche market drugs to address patient specific treatments 
this creates the need  from the research and development r d and manufacturing perspectives  for more flexible and multi product r d and manufacturing sites 
as a result of the high manufacturing and r d costs in this industry  there is intense pressure by manufacturers to improve efficiencies 
this market shift has led to an industry wide trend towards beginning to use disposable process technology eg  films and polymers in place of traditional stainless steel processes  which will accelerate time to market for new products  reduce capital investments  reduce cleaning and recertification costs  and reduce contamination risk associated with multi product manufacturing facilities 
life sciences manufacturing process manufacturing in the life sciences markets is similar to semiconductor manufacturing  in that both processes produce high purity materials  must be reliable and repeatable  and demand continued process automation and efficiencies in manufacturing in order to reduce costs and to deliver value to the customers 
atmi is able to leverage its semiconductor manufacturing expertise in the life sciences arena by utilizing its expertise in handling  storing  and delivering materials in a reliable manner  and utilizing its understanding of key interactions between materials and related packaging  and life sciences one time use applications 
this is particularly the case  because the disposable market maturity is about years behind the semiconductor market 
atmi s strategy atmi s strategic intent is to be the source of process efficiency solutions to technology driven customers by providing innovative materials and related delivery systems and technologies to focus development and application engineering initiatives with the leading manufacturers to provide next generation performance materials and process solutions 
target high growth  high margin specialty markets that use atmi s core materials and packaging technologies and require products that are consumed in the production process 
add value through performance materials packaging  dispensing  and process technologies designed to meet the demands of users for greater levels of purity  productivity  safety  environmental responsiveness  and speed 
significantly shorten new product development time lines and the development of next generation materials through the use of a combinatorial science based research approach and hpd capabilities 
leverage atmi s technology leadership by investing extensively in developing proprietary and patented materials and process solutions  which the company uses to quickly commercialize new offerings for customers 
form strategic alliances  including joint development programs and collaborative marketing efforts  to accelerate the introduction of atmi s products into existing and new markets 

table of contents in summary  atmi s strategy does not encompass a traditional materials supplier to customer relationship 
in those relationships  suppliers tend to provide materials to customers based solely on the cost  quantity  and quality of the materials being supplied 
instead  atmi works to develop partnerships with its customers based on atmi s ability to improve the process efficiency of customers development  scale up  manufacturing and supply chain processes  thereby reducing customers total cost of ownership 
atmi seeks to provide value to its customers through the use of its technical capabilities  and applications knowledge in a manner that changes its commercial relationship with those customers to a value sharing relationship 
products atmi believes it is among the most innovative suppliers of high purity materials and related delivery systems and technologies 
atmi has sought to take advantage of the changes in the market for materials  packaging and delivery systems by developing and commercializing a broad range of front end semiconductor performance materials  developing and commercializing sub atmospheric pressure gas storage and delivery systems for safe handling and delivery of toxic and hazardous gases to semiconductor process equipment  developing and commercializing innovative high purity materials packaging and dispensing systems that allow for the reliable introduction of low volatility liquids and solids to semiconductor processes  developing manufacturing processes to meet the critical purity and integrity requirements of the microelectronics manufacturers  and developing and commercializing single use life sciences industry technologies using our experience in high purity materials packaging and dispensing systems 
in meeting the needs of our customers  which include semiconductor device manufacturers  flat panel display manufacturers  chemical suppliers  semiconductor original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and life sciences entities  located throughout the world  and anticipating their future requirements  we seek to utilize our global hpd capabilities incorporating high productivity combinatorial science based research tools to shorten the development cycle to create new materials that resolve current process issues  which meet the needs of advanced technology roadmaps of our key customers  maintain close relations with our customers in order to quickly understand their needs and issues  offer a complete line of performance materials  and related materials packaging  dispensing and process technologies  and disposable containment  mixing  and bioreactor systems  provide a high level of customer service and applications support in all global markets  meet customer needs for statistical quality and process control and dock to stock programs  and meet the industry s needs for advanced materials required for future generation devices 

table of contents solutions atmi serves and provides applications and analytical support services to three primary markets integrated circuit ic fabrication including ion implant and interconnect materials and delivery systems  flat panel displays including advanced high purity materials packaging and dispensing systems  and the life sciences market 
ic fabrication the ic fabrication market represents the largest portion of atmi s business and development activities 
the principal drivers for this market are cost  yield  speed  utilization of capital  and risk reduction 
economics continue to play an important part in driving the deployment of electronic goods with increased functionality at a lower cost dictating electronic component success 
yield and capital utilization are significant drivers for the ic industry due to the implications on throughput and financial return  and the challenge is compounded by the requirement to manufacture devices at increasingly complex advanced technology generations 
in an industry where the capital infrastructure is significant and product life cycles are short  the ability to rapidly bring the next generation technology to market can make a significant difference in our customers success 
atmi s ability to shorten deployment of production ready solutions is critical to our success 
and finally  the ic fabrication industry involves extremely complex manufacturing processes where the mechanisms of advanced materials interactions are not always fully understood 
atmi s ability to characterize and control process input variables helps to meet the need for risk reduction 
ion implant module the primary issues within the ion implant module are production throughput  cost  and safety because of the hazardous properties of the implant gases used 
atmi s patented sds solutions use a standard gas cylinder containing an adsorbent material 
the cylinder is filled with gas under conditions such that the gas is adsorbed onto the adsorbent material at sub atmospheric pressure 
sub atmospheric storage of hazardous gases minimizes potential leaks of gas during transportation and use  thus providing significant safety and environmental improvements over traditional high pressure cylinders 
in addition  sds products allow more process gas to be stored in the cylinder  providing significantly higher rates of productivity than traditional methods of gas delivery used in ion implantation manufacturing processes 
because ion implantation processes operate at reduced pressures  the gas can be desorbed or released from the sds gas sources using the ion implanter s vacuum pumps 
sds gas sources can be installed and operated like conventional high pressure gas cylinders with minimal maintenance 
these advantages have led the majority of significant chip manufacturers to adopt this technology as the industry standard for dopant gas delivery 
atmi invests significant resources in developing solutions that can increase throughput and which can provide customers a return on their investment while continuing to control the risks associated with hazardous gases for the ion implant module 
an example of these developments for ion implant is sds materials packaged in sds systems include primarily arsine  phosphine  and boron trifluoride 
the third generation of sds products  called sds  maintains all the inherent safety features of previous generation sds products  but dramatically increases the gas storage capacity by using a new adsorbent 
the to times capacity improvement over the previous sds products allows ion implanter users to reduce tool down time  resulting in significant cost savings for our customers 
advanced interconnect solutions atmi has developed several solutions for the advanced interconnect of ic fabrication 
millions of transistors on an integrated circuit are connected with a system of conducting wires in an insulating media 
as demand for higher electronic components capabilities and performance grows  the need for more transistors and faster speeds is met through shrinkage 
this poses problems for ic designers since smaller devices and features result in delays of signal transfer because fewer electrons can travel down a smaller path  and the potential for signals to short circuit increases with the proximity of these smaller wires 
the primary drivers for advanced interconnect are to reduce the resistance of the wires make them more conductive and to improve the permittivity of the dielectric provide them with better insulation 

table of contents these issues have been solved through the adoption of copper interconnects replacing aluminum  and the use of low k dielectrics 
the lower the k value  the greater the insulation 
any particle or defect can result in a short where the dielectric fails and two adjacent wires connect or an open where the wire fails to transmit the signal 
almost all of the development work within atmi s advanced interconnect capability is focused on one of two areas providing materials and technology that prevent particles and defects  and providing materials and technology that help to manage the film properties of the conductor and the insulator 
developments in these areas have enabled the industry to develop advanced interconnects that are reliable and provide high yields quickly 
surface preparation 
atmi s ap and st brand wafer photoresist strip cleaning materials are proprietary chemistries used for applications such as semiconductor post etch residue removal  wafer etching  organics removal  negative resist removal  edge bead removal  and corrosion prevention 
our surface preparation solutions are being used in some of the most advanced copper ic fabrication plants fabs around the world for various surface preparation applications such as post cmp cleaning and pre nitride deposition surface treatment 
the applications for these products are expanding rapidly as the advanced ic device designs drop to nanometers and below 
customers using atmi s surface preparation solutions are able to benefit from higher yield and more reliable interconnects that result from fewer particles and defects 
copper plating 
atmi believes it is a market leader in materials used in copper ecd applications with the viaform copper materials that it offers 
viaform materials include inorganic and proprietary organic molecules that provide the backbone for copper interconnects 
the viaform solution enables manufacturers to eliminate processing steps by applying two layers of copper in a single step known as dual damascene 
dual damascene copper processing in semiconductor devices is a rapidly growing market with most major logic segment semiconductor companies in production at   and nanometers  in development at and nanometers  and research at nanometers and below 
the memory segment is also experiencing growth in copper interconnect  with most memory companies in production at nanometers and in development at nanometers 
deposition 
the advanced interconnects also include several processes for depositing thin films such as cvd and atomic layer deposition ald processes that are enabled by advanced liquid  gaseous and solid precursors 
the technology development of chemical synthesis and manufacturing techniques provide atmi with a competitive advantage in this area 
atmi markets its ultrapur materials for pre metal dielectric  dielectric and barrier applications 
atmi is well positioned for the incorporation of ald processes by the semiconductor industry with its proe vap ampoule 
this proprietary container allows for reliable delivery of low volatility solid precursors required for processes that demand ald  like high k gates 
atmi has successfully adopted the carbon adsorption technology used in sds and introduced products for semiconductor deposition processes marketed under the sage brand 
these applications include low k plasma enhanced deposition  or pe cvd  processes using low k materials  pre metal dielectric high density plasma  or hdp cvd  and films using phosphine gases and thermal deposition processes using germane gases 
atmi has also introduced a silane product in a vac package used in processes such as hdp cvd  for improved safety 
materials packaging 
atmi s nowpak liner technologies and container assemblies form the basis for its high purity liquid materials packaging and dispensing system product portfolio 
for applications in ic fabrication  this product line includes the bag in a bottle and bag in a drum container systems  each with its own companion dispense connection system 
each package features a pre cleaned collapsible inner liner  or bag  inside a rugged  high density polyethylene overpack 
the standard liner films are made of polytetrafluoroethylene and other polymers  which allow chemicals to be delivered to the manufacturing process without compromising their inherent purity 
the empty inner liner is easily removed for waste consolidation  and the outer shell is recyclable or returnable for insertion of a new replacement liner 
the dispensing system promotes full use of the chemical  chemical isolation from environmental contamination  and improved safety during dispense by sealing and isolating the chemical from the environment to further protect the chemical and the operator 
the largest current market for nowpak packaging products is photoresist and related chemicals used to pattern integrated circuits and flat panel displays 
for integrated circuit patterning  these materials are typically packaged in bag in a bottle containers that range in size from to liters 
recently  applications have expanded beyond photolithography chemicals in the semiconductor market to include photolithography ancillary chemicals  cmp slurries  and other critical process chemicals using the recently developed liter bag in a drum container system 

table of contents flat panel display market the flat panel display market has the potential for further growth because of the demand for flat screen televisions and various display applications 
manufacturers in this market compete by driving down costs and keeping yields high 
to address these needs  atmi has developed novel high purity materials packaging and dispensing systems 
atmi s nowpak liner technologies and container assemblies also address the needs of the flat panel display market through the bag in a can product  which has its own companion dispense connection system  as described above  and uses larger to liter containers 
the bag in a can features a cleaned collapsible inner liner  or bag  inside a rugged stainless steel over pack 
the standard liner films are made of proprietary multi ply films of polyolefin and other polymers  which allow chemicals to be delivered to the manufacturing process without compromising their inherent purity 
the empty inner liner is easily removed for waste consolidation  and the outer shell is returned for insertion of a new replacement liner 
the dispensing system promotes full use of the chemical 
the fundamentally unique advantage of the bag in a can for the flat panel display market is that the drive gas used to transfer the chemical from the supply container to the process tool is isolated from the chemistry  thereby minimizing defects and variation in the manufacturing process 
life sciences atmi is addressing an increasing number of critical materials handling needs for the life sciences markets 
other markets for the company s proprietary high purity materials handling and dispensing systems include the biotechnology and laboratory markets  which we believe offer significant growth potential 
the biotechnology industry has been using disposable components like filters  connectors  and disposable storage bags for several years  however  biotechnology customers have a growing need to combine these disposable components and integrate them into disposable systems 
atmi has responded to this trend by launching a complete offering of scalable disposable containment  mixing and bioreactor systems 
atmi s newmix levtech proprietary disposable mixing technology is the market leading technology for disposable mixing applications within the life sciences market 
the solutions delivered to our customers consist of a hardware system that is compatible with a one time use mixing bag container  the technology delivers unique particle free mixing and is scalable to an industrial scale 
a typical biotech manufacturing process has over different mixing steps starting from a cell culture process through the final fill drug solutions 
atmi mixing technology is typically used for preparing buffers and media solutions for feeding the cell culture and chromatography applications  but also other process steps like virus inactivation and final fill solutions 
raw materials we use a broad range of specialty and commodity chemicals and polymers in the development of our products  including parts and sub assemblies that are obtained from outside suppliers 
we seek  where possible  to have several sources of supply for all of these materials 
although we may  in some instances  rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers  or upon suppliers in a single country  for certain of these materials  we have not experienced any sustained interruption in production or the supply of these materials and do not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining the materials necessary to manufacture our products 
working capital in the ordinary course of our business  we maintain an adequate level of working capital at all times to support business needs 
in accordance with our industry s practices  we do not need to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet the delivery requirements of our customers 
we generally do not provide customers with rights of return with the exception of standard warranty provisions  which historically have not been material and we generally do not provide customers extended payment terms beyond days

atmi s sds products using adsorbent based delivery technology face competition from some mechanical based product approaches to delivering gas at sub atmospheric pressure which currently comprise a small portion of the market 
several companies compete with high pressure gas cylinders and solid sources 
there are numerous domestic and foreign companies that offer products that compete with atmi s materials  materials packaging and materials delivery systems

atmi has made significant investments to create global hpd capabilities that incorporate high productivity combinatorial science based research tools to shorten the new product development life cycle and more rapidly create new materials needed by our customers for their advanced technology roadmaps 
while conventional r d methods allow for one process experiment to be conducted on a single wafer  hpd capabilities enable engineers to evaluate up to different test chemistries on a wafer at once 
this technique allows independent control of formulation  stir rate and exposure time at each independent site on a test surface yielding a rich source of data regarding materials choices in a fraction of the time and at lower cost than conventional research methods 
beyond the improvements in speed and data quality during the evaluation period  results are also subjected to both automated and human experience driven understanding of semiconductor manufacturing process flows 
the union of these forces produces much faster learning cycles  and makes it possible to rapidly narrow substantial volumes of data to a most promising subset of chemical formulations 
the process is iterative  concurrently assessing large numbers of precisely selected  newly designed test variations 
since production of the earliest ics  a readily identifiable group of the same dielectrics  dopants and metals were applied with only limited refinements or modifications 
the introduction of copper has changed that dynamic  now  virtually every new technology generations requires no fewer than a dozen new materials 
looking into the future  the industry evolution to nanometer will encompass approximately new materials in a process involving nearly  steps  dramatically increasing the need to have a tool which enables more rapid feedback for the determination of materials that would be appropriate for individual processes 
there is a significant and growing need among our customers to have access to hpd capabilities to enable them to keep pace with these market changes 
the fundamental obstacle to overcome in trying to develop optimal chemistries 
table of contents in this environment is that conducting experiments in the conventional serial fashion will not produce answers rapidly enough to meet technology node insertion deadlines or competitive needs 
our hpd capabilities allow us to pursue more new product opportunities  in a shorter time  and using fewer resources compared to current methods 
by performing a higher rate of experiments and identifying promising routes for integrating these materials in actual production flows  and in certain instances  learning about device characteristics  including electrical performance  much earlier in the process than traditional approaches should differentiate atmi s materials development capabilities from our competition 
we have recently demonstrated reductions in cycle time of up to percent in the development of certain customer solutions 
we are currently using our hpd capabilities to solve customers materials challenges in applications such as post cmp cleaning  high dose implant strip  copper post etch residue removal  high k metal gate cleaning and others all areas that pose substantial development hurdles for our customers in the race to transition to the next technology node 
while we initially focused atmi s hpd programs primarily on wet chemistry applications  in we added dry chemistry capabilities  which expanded our customer interactions and partnerships to materials  such as high k metal gate precursors  in advanced memory applications

table of contents item a 
risk factors cautionary statements regarding future results of operations you should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings 
these cautionary statements are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like atmi with broad international operations 
like other companies  we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers 
similarly  the price of our common stock is subject to volatility because of fluctuations in general market conditions  differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community  and other factors beyond our control 
the global economic recession and continuing uncertainty in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business may be affected by the ongoing volatility and illiquidity in the financial and credit markets  the general global economic recession  such as inflationary or deflationary pressures and other market or economic challenges experienced by the world economy 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
the recent tightening of credit in financial markets and the general economic downturn has led consumers and businesses to postpone spending  which has caused our customers to delay orders with us 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of these disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions  and if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
cyclicality in the markets we sell to may adversely affect our performance 
the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases or decreases in demand 
these changes  along with cyclical changes in the flat panel display market  could adversely affect our results of operations and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our results of operations have been adversely affected  and may be further affected in the future  if demand for semiconductors  or devices that use semiconductors  or flat panels decreases or grows at a significantly slower pace than has historically occurred 
subsequent upturns in the markets which we serve have historically been characterized by sudden increased product demand and production capacity constraints 
we may have difficulty reacting quickly enough to a sudden upturn in demand for our products and may incur significant expediting and manufacturing costs to meet a rapid increase in customer demand 
our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors 
our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors  including decreases in our shipment volume  reductions in  or obsolescence of  our inventory and shifts in our product mix 
many of our expenses  particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are fixed in the short term 
accordingly  reduced demand for our products and services can cause our fixed production costs to be allocated across reduced production volumes  which can adversely affect our gross margin and profitability  and reduced demand could adversely affect our performance 
our ability to reduce expenses is further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing global customer base 

table of contents our business could be adversely affected if we cannot protect our proprietary technology or if we infringe on the proprietary technology of others 
our proprietary technology aids our ability to compete effectively with other companies 
although we have been awarded  have filed applications for or have been licensed under numerous patents in the united states and other countries  these patents may not fully protect our technology or competitive position 
further  our competitors may apply for and obtain patents that will restrict our ability to make and sell our products 
our competitors may intentionally infringe our patents 
third parties may also assert infringement claims against us in the future 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets or know how  to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
the defense and prosecution of patent suits are both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
outside the united states  in particular  such proceedings can be extremely expensive and their outcome very unpredictable 
an adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could cause us to lose proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to license rights from third parties or to cease selling our products 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology that others may independently develop or otherwise obtain access to 
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies could negatively affect our revenues and earnings 
the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 
while we generate revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide  the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers  including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations 
our customers and their customers aggressive management of inventory has already adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to adversely affect future results of operations 
customer driven pricing pressure may adversely affect our average selling prices 
we face aggressive cost containment pressures from our customers 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain current prices in the face of continuing pricing pressures 
over time  the average price for our products may decline as the markets for these products become more competitive 
any material reduction in product prices could negatively affect both revenues and profits 
our revenues and earnings could be negatively affected if we cannot anticipate market trends  enhance our existing products and processes  develop and commercialize new products and processes  and identify and consummate strategic acquisitions 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends  to enhance our existing products and processes  to develop and commercialize new products and processes  and to expand through selected acquisitions of technologies or businesses or other strategic alliances 
the microelectronics industry markets we serve undergo frequent technological changes  which in turn create demand for new and improved products and process technologies 
we may not be able to improve our existing products and process technologies or to develop and market new products and technologies that will be cost effective or introduced in a timely manner or accepted in the marketplace 
we may not be able to leverage our knowledge to make full use of combinatorial science and hpd capabilities into as an effective market offering for our customers 
our failure to develop or introduce enhanced and new products and processes in a timely manner may negatively affect our revenues and earnings  and result in a potential impairment of assets 
management considers  on a continuing basis  potential acquisitions of technologies and businesses and other strategic alliances  some of which may be material to us 
however  we cannot be assured that we will identify or succeed in consummating transactions with suitable acquisition candidates or alliance partners in the future 

table of contents we may have difficulty obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing or assembling our products or operating other aspects of our business  which could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs 
we have hundreds of suppliers providing various materials that we use in the production of our products and other aspects of our business  and we seek  where possible  to have several sources of supply for all of these materials 
however  we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers  or upon suppliers in a single country  for certain of these materials 
the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production process 
in addition  production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as electricity  chemicals  and gases 
the unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of these materials or resources 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we face intense competition from a variety of sources  including larger companies 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive 
a number of domestic and international companies engage in commercial activities in the markets we serve 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  as this industry evolves  other competitors may emerge 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in and focus upon research and development and product and process innovation 
we may not be successful if we cannot compete on price  technical capabilities  quality  or customer service 
our global manufacturing and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal  political  economic or other changes 
we have facilities in eight countries worldwide and  in  more than percent of our revenues came from sales to companies outside the united states 
operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies  as well as the general political and economic conditions  security risks  health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks  of the various countries in which we operate  which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchanges rates 
given our current operations and large customer base outside the united states  we employ the use of forward currency exchange contracts to attempt to minimize the potentially adverse earnings effect from exchange rate fluctuations on our net balance sheet exposures 
nevertheless  in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non us currencies in which we transact business  such as the euro  japanese yen  and the south korean won  fluctuations can have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by natural events in the locations in which we  our customers or our suppliers operate 
we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes that could disrupt operations 
in addition  our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations 
a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations  or our customers or suppliers operations  may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 
our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered may affect our ability to meet our forecasts  especially during the current economic crisis where there is limited visibility to future wafer starts 
in addition  when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times  we manufacture product based on forecasts of customers demands 
these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions 
if we inaccurately forecast customer demand  or if the industry recovers more quickly than anticipated  we may incur expedited shipping costs to deliver products to meet customer demand or hold excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents we may have difficulty managing our growth and attracting and retaining highly skilled scientific  technical  managerial and marketing personnel  which could adversely affect our revenues and increase our operating expenses 
despite the recent economic downturn and contraction of our business  we have historically experienced periods of growth and intend to grow our business in the future 
the management of our growth requires qualified personnel  systems and other resources 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific  technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the industries that we serve is intense  and our competitors are often larger and more established than we are 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
in addition  our expansion may also significantly strain operational  management  financial  sales and marketing and other resources 
to manage growth effectively  we must continue to enhance and integrate our information technology infrastructure  systems and controls and successfully expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may not be able to manage this expansion effectively  including by providing satisfactory levels of customer service and technical support 
inability to manage our growth and to attract and retain skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we engage in acquisitions  and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations  therefore  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions 
in the past several years  we have made certain acquisitions intended to complement and expand our business  and may continue to do so in the future 
the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions  apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses  and cooperate with our strategic partners 
we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations  applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions  and in managing strategic investments 
furthermore  we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we face the risk of product liability claims 
the manufacture and sale of our products  which include thin film and other toxic materials  involve the risk of product liability claims 
in addition  a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of the customer 
our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us 
our business is potentially subject to substantial liabilities for failure to comply with environmental regulations 
we use  generate and discharge toxic or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our manufacturing  processing and research and development activities 
as a result  we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the storage  use and disposal of these materials 
our failure to comply with present or future laws could result in fines or other liabilities being imposed on us  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
in addition  under federal and state statutes and regulations  a government agency may seek to recover its response costs and or require future remedial measures from both operators and owners of property where releases of hazardous substances may have occurred including releases by prior occupants or are ongoing  and for which only partial indemnification may be available in some cases 
our activities may also result in our being subject to additional regulation 
such regulations could require us to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur other substantial expenses to comply with environmental laws 
our failure to control the use of hazardous substances could subject us to substantial financial liabilities 

table of contents our financial results or financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions  estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters 
generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements  implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business  such as revenue recognition  asset impairment  inventories  self insurance  tax matters and litigation  are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions  estimates and judgments 
changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions  estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in taxation 
we have facilities in eight countries and  as a result  are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities 
tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries  or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 
in addition  we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the appropriate jurisdiction to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction 
changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income  which could in turn affect our results of operations 
we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets  which could also affect our results of operations 
each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year 
if that performance forecast changes  our forecasted tax liability may change 
compliance with changing corporate governance regulations and public disclosures may result in additional risks and exposures 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of and new regulations from the sec  have created uncertainty for public companies such as ours 
these laws  regulations  and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices and our commitment to maintaining high standards with regard thereto 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations  and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased selling  general  and administrative expenses and significant management time and attention 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment and  our independent registered public accounting firm s audit  for fiscal have necessitated  and we expect such efforts to continue to necessitate  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing in item of this form k 
company overview we believe we are among the leading suppliers of high performance materials  materials packaging and materials delivery systems used worldwide in the manufacture of microelectronics devices 
our products consist of front end semiconductor performance materials  sub atmospheric pressure gas delivery systems for safe handling and delivery of toxic and hazardous gases to semiconductor process equipment  high purity materials packaging and dispensing systems that allow for the reliable introduction of low volatility liquids and solids to microelectronics and biopharmaceutical processes 
atmi targets both semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers  whose products form the foundation of microelectronics technology rapidly proliferating through the consumer products  information technology  automotive  healthcare  and communications industries 
the market for microelectronics devices is continually changing  which drives demand for new products and technologies at lower cost 
atmi s customers include many of the leading semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers in the world who target leading edge technologies 
atmi also addresses an increasing number of critical materials handling needs for the life sciences markets 
our proprietary containment  mixing  and bioreactor technologies are sold to the biotechnology and laboratory markets  which we believe offer significant growth potential 
atmi s objective is to meet the demands of our microelectronics and life sciences customers with solutions that maximize the efficiency of their manufacturing processes  reduce capital costs  and minimize the time to develop new products and integrate them into their processes 
use of estimates preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
these policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by atmi s audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from product sales are generally recognized upon delivery to a common carrier when terms are equivalent to free on board fob origin and upon receipt by a customer when terms are equivalent to fob destination 
in instances where final acceptance of equipment is specified by the purchase agreement  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been satisfied 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we accrue for sales returns  warranty costs  and other allowances based on a current evaluation of our experience based on stated terms of the transactions 
should actual product failure rates or customer return experience differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated accruals would be required 
we use an exclusive contract manufacturer  which is also an exclusive distribution partner  for the manufacture and distribution of our sds products the licensed products 
under the terms of the manufacturing agreement  atmi retains the right to manufacture percent of all licensed products  while the contract manufacturer has the right to manufacture percent of all licensed products 
upon completion of manufacture  atmi purchases all licensed products produced by the contract manufacturer 
under the terms of the distribution agreement  we receive payment from the distributor based upon a formula which is dependent on the sale price obtained by the distributor to its customer 
atmi recognizes revenue from the sale of licensed products to this distribution partner when the distributor sells the licensed products to its customers  because that is when the sales price becomes fixed and determinable by the company 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors surrounding the credit risk of the markets we operate in and the financial viability of specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends  we assess the financial health of the markets we operate in and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and ongoing reviews of account balances and agings of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within the time frame of the credit terms extended 
write offs are charged directly against the allowance for doubtful accounts and occur only after all collection efforts have been exhausted 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates because of unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks surrounding specific customers 
during the first quarter of  we increased our reserve by million due to exposures related to customer bankruptcy filings and uncertainties of collections due to the current general macroeconomic conditions 
through the course of  we recovered million of this amount 
as of december  and we had million and million  respectively  of allowance for doubtful accounts reserves recorded 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any abrupt adverse changes in market conditions may require us to record additional reserves 
inventory valuation reserves inventory valuation reserves are established in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our consolidated balance sheets 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is less than inventory cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include whether individual inventory parts or chemicals meet current specifications and cannot be substituted for or reworked into a part currently being sold or used as a service part  overall market conditions  and other inventory management initiatives 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of inventory valuation reserves recorded 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any abrupt adverse changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves 
non marketable equity securities we selectively invest in non marketable equity securities of private companies  which range from early stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an atmi product or initiative 
at december   the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in non marketable equity securities totaled million million at december  
non marketable equity securities are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other non current assets 
investments in non marketable equity securities are inherently risky  and some of these companies are likely to fail 
their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development  market acceptance  operational efficiency  attracting and retaining talented professionals  and other key business success factors 
in addition  depending on their future prospects  they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations  with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments would likely become impaired 

table of contents we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis may require significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects  b the technological feasibility of the investee s products and technologies  c the general market conditions in the investee s industry or geographic area  including adverse regulatory or economic changes  d factors related to the investee s ability to remain in business  such as the investee s liquidity  and the rate at which the investee is using its cash  and e the investee s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 
investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its fair value  using the framework required by accounting standards codification asc fair value measurements and disclosures 
when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view  we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
we recognized no impairments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities in million in and none in 
income taxes the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is million at december  and million at december  we believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
with the january  adoption of revised business combinations rules  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances recorded in a business combination and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements

depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment atmi s net property  plant and equipment at december  and was million and million  respectively  representing percent and percent  respectively  of the company s consolidated total assets 

table of contents depreciation expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 
property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets useful lives on a straight line basis for financial reporting purposes 
the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors  including historical experience with similar assets and technological life cycles 
circumstances and events relating to these assets are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly 
the depreciation periods used are buildings  to years  machinery and equipment  to years  computer equipment and software  to years  cylinders and canisters  to years  furniture and fixtures  years  and leasehold improvements  over the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life 
we use accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate 
equity based compensation the company uses the black scholes merton options pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options under asc compensation stock compensation 
management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs  including anticipated changes in the underlying stock price ie  expected volatility and option exercise activity ie  expected term 
for awards granted subsequent to january   expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of atmi common stock for a period shorter than the expected term of the options 
we have excluded the historical volatility prior to the public announcement regarding the sale of our non core businesses in  because those businesses that were sold represented a significant portion of atmi s consolidated business and were subject to considerable cyclicality associated with the semiconductor equipment industry  which drove increased volatility in atmi s stock price 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected term 
we recognize expense only for those awards expected to vest 
if factors change and result in different assumptions in the application of asc in future periods  the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
equity based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated service period of the awards 
fair value measurements all of our financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value based upon level or level inputs  as defined under asc  with the exception of one auction rate security  which has been measured using level inputs  because the security is illiquid 
for level measurements  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
for level measurements  we use observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities  quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets  or model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
for level measurements  we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
the calculation of fair value for our auction rate security requires critical judgments and estimates by management including assumptions about the anticipated term and the yield that a market participant would require to purchase such a security in the current market environment 
as of december  we have recorded a temporary impairment charge of million  net of tax  within the caption accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets based upon an independent third party valuation we received for this auction rate security 
in  we have also recorded a credit loss of million in our consolidated statement of operations 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies or market conditions for this security can have a material impact on the values of the related assets  our financial position  and overall liquidity 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  changes in the microelectronics and biopharmaceutical industries  changes in technology  and the execution of management s plans 
we concluded that goodwill was not impaired during a decline in our projected reporting unit cash flows would not impact the conclusion we reached in although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
other long lived amortizable assets we evaluate the potential impairment of other long lived assets when appropriate 
if the carrying value of assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows  the carrying value of the asset is written down to fair value

liquidity and capital resources we assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investing activities 
of particular importance to management are cash flows generated by operating activities and cash used for capital expenditures 
until required for use in the business  we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits  certificates of deposit  money market securities  government and government sponsored bond obligations  and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy 
we have contracted with investment advisers to invest our funds consistent with our investment policy 
the value of our investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio  and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in value of the investments  which could impact our financial position and our overall liquidity 
each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost 
we attempt to mitigate these risks with the assistance of our investment advisors by investing in high quality securities and monitoring the overall risk profile of our portfolio

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities included bank deposits  certificates of deposit  money market securities  and government and government sponsored bond obligations 
as of december   an increase of basis points in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would reduce the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would increase the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and as a result  the company has limited exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
approximately percent of the company s revenues for the year ended december  were denominated in japanese yen jpy  korean won  and euros  but a majority of the product is sourced in us dollars 
management periodically reviews the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material effect on the company s financial results in the future 
we use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge specific exposures relating to intercompany payments and anticipated  but not yet committed  intercompany sales primarily parent company export sales to subsidiaries at pre established us dollar prices 
the terms of the forward foreign exchange contracts are generally matched to the underlying transaction being hedged  and are typically under one year 
because such contracts are directly associated with identified transactions  they are an effective hedge against fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency underlying the transaction 
we recognize in earnings other income expense  net changes in the fair value of all derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments that are highly effective and recognize in accumulated other comprehensive income any changes in the fair value of all derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments that are highly effective and meet the other related accounting requirements 
we generally do not hedge overseas sales denominated in foreign currencies or translation exposures 
further  we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all of our derivatives were highly effective throughout the periods reported 
at december   we held forward foreign currency exchange contracts as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling million  which are being used to hedge recorded foreign denominated liabilities and which will be settled in either jpy or new taiwan dollars ntd 
the functional currency of our taiwanese subsidiary is us dollars 
we have opened a foreign currency position to hedge a significant local currency prepayment made by our taiwanese subsidiary related to income tax exposures 
holding other variables constant  if there were a percent decline in foreign exchange rates for the jpy and ntd  the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  would increase by approximately million  which would be expected to be fully offset by foreign exchange gains on the amounts being hedged 
the effect of an immediate percent change in other foreign exchange rates would not be expected to have a material effect on the company s future operating results or cash flows 

table of contents changes in market risk the global recession  driven initially by the crisis in global credit and financial markets  has caused extreme disruptions  including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  increases in unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
the current constriction of credit in financial markets may continue to lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending  which may cause our customers to continue to aggressively manage their inventories and delay their future orders with us 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets remains uncertain and continues to have a negative impact on global economic conditions  and if the current economic conditions continue or deteriorate  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
