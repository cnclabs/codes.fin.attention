overview we are a clinical stage  biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases 
our primary focus is the development and commercialization of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents  or vdas  that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions 
to date  more than subjects have been treated with zybrestat in human clinical trials  and the drug candidate has generally been observed to be well tolerated

table of contents zybrestat for oncology falcon trial randomized  controlled phase ii study with zybrestat in non small cell lung cancer we are currently evaluating zybrestat in a patient  randomized  controlled phase ii clinical trial  which we refer to as the falcon trial  as a potential first line treatment for non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
in the falcon trial  patients are randomized either to the treatment arm of study  in which they receive zybrestat in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents  carboplatin and paclitaxel  and the anti angiogenic drug  bevacizumab  or to the control arm of the study  in which they receive a standard combination regimen of carboplatin  paclitaxel and bevacizumab 
we believe this study  if successful  will provide support for initiating discussions with the us food and drug administration or fda for a pivotal registration study with zybrestat in nsclc  and more generally  provide clinical validation supporting further evaluation of zybrestat in combination with commonly used anti angiogenic therapeutics that act via vascular endothelial growth factor  or vegf  pathway inhibition 
on november   we reported interim safety data from the falcon study for the first patients treated in this study 
the data from this planned interim safety analysis indicated that the combination of zybrestat with carboplatin and paclitaxel plus bevacizumab appeared to be well tolerated  and that there were no significant overlapping toxicities with bevacizumab 
five of the six patient deaths due to disease progression during the evaluation period and occurred in the control arm of the study 
the data was presented in a poster by a principal investigator for the phase trial at the aacr nci eortc molecular targets and cancer therapeutics conference 
a further analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of this combination is expected to be presented at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology  or asco  scheduled for june  in chicago  illinois 
fact fosbretabulin in anaplastic cancer of the thyroid trial phase study with zybrestat in anaplastic thyroid cancer atc in  we initiated a study in which zybrestat would be evaluated in a patient  phase study  which we refer to as the fact trial  as a potential treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer  or atc  a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy for which there are currently no approved therapeutics and extremely limited treatment options 
the primary endpoint for the fact trial is overall survival 
in the fact trial  patients are randomized either to the treatment arm of the study  in which they receive zybrestat in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin and paclitaxel  or to the control arm of the study  in which they receive only carboplatin and paclitaxel 
in february  due to financial considerations  we decided to stop further enrollment in the phase fact clinical trial in atc  but will continue to treat and follow all patients who are currently enrolled 
an event driven survival analysis is anticipated in late or early the fda granted fast track designation to zybrestat for the treatment of regionally advanced and or metastatic atc 
zybrestat was awarded orphan drug status by the fda and the european commission in the european union for the treatment of advanced atc and for the treatment of medullary  stage iv papillary and stage iv follicular thyroid cancers 
these designations would not be affected by the halted enrollment in the phase study 
in  we completed a special protocol assessment  or spa  process with the us food and drug administration  or fda  for this phase study 
the fda has been informed that enrollment in this study was halted and that the company expected that the spa would not longer be applicable 
any utility of the truncated phase study for regulatory purposes would have to be negotiated with the fda once study outcomes  and in particular overall survival data  are available 
phase ii trial with zybrestat in platinum resistant ovarian cancer on june   results from a phase ii trial with zybrestat in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents  carboplatin and paclitaxel  in recurrent  platinum resistant ovarian cancer  were presented at asco 
we believe the results of this study support further development of zybrestat in ovarian cancer and we are 
table of contents considering options for undertaking further randomized  controlled studies in ovarian cancer  including a study or studies which may potentially be undertaken in collaboration with an oncology cooperative study group and support by the cancer therapy evaluation program ctep of the national cancer institute 
we believe that  if successful  the ongoing zybrestat study program will establish a compelling rationale for further development of zybrestat as a treatment for aggressive and difficult to treat malignancies  use in combination with chemotherapy in a variety of solid tumors  particularly those in which carboplatin and or paclitaxel chemotherapy are commonly used  and use in combination with commonly used anti angiogenic drugs  such as bevacizumab  that act via vegf pathway inhibition  in various solid tumor indications 
we believe these areas for potential further development collectively represent a sifnificant unmet medical need and thus a significant potential commercial market opportunity that includes cancers of the thyroid  ovary  kidney  liver  head and neck  breast  lung  skin  brain  colon and rectum 
in addition  based upon preclinical results first published by our collaborators in the november online issue of the journal blood  as well as preclinical data presented in april at the annual meeting of the american association of cancer research aacr  we believe that zybrestat and its other vda product candidates  particularly oxi  may also have utility in the treatment of hematological malignancies or liquid tumors  such as acute myeloid leukemia 
oxi  a unique  second generation vda for oncology indications we are currently pursuing development of oxi  a second generation  dual mechanism vda  as a treatment for certain solid tumor types 
we believe that oxi is differentiated from other vdas by its dual action activity 
our data indicates that in addition to having potent vascular disrupting effects  oxi is unique in that it can be metabolized by oxidative enzymes to an orthoquinone chemical species that has direct tumor cell killing effects 
we believe this unique property may result in enhanced anti tumor activity in certain tumor types as compared with other vda drug candidates 
based on data from preclinical studies  we believe that oxi may have enhanced activity in tumor types with relatively high levels of oxidative enzymes that can facilitate the metabolism of the active oxi vda to kill tumor cells 
these tumor types include hepatocellular carcinoma  melanoma  and myeloid leukemia 
in preclinical studies  oxi has shown potent anti tumor activity against solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia models  both as a single agent and in combination with other cancer treatment modalities 
we have completed a phase i clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors sponsored by clinical research united kingdom  and we are currently evaluating oxi in an ongoing clinical trial sponsored by us in a phase ib trial  initiated in the first quarter of in patients with solid tumors with hepatic involvement 
we intend to conduct an interim analysis of the latter trial in mid  and future developments thereafter will depend on the outcome of this interim analysis 
to date  oxi has been observed to have a manageable side effect profile similar to that of other agents in the vda class  potential single agent clinical activity  and effects on tumor blood flow and tumor metabolic activity  as determined with several imaging modalities 
in december we filed a us ind for oxi we anticipate initiating an additional phase i study of oxi in a leukemic indication during  subject to available resources 
zybrestat for ophthalmology in addition to developing zybrestat as an intravenously administered therapy for oncology indications  we are undertaking an ophthalmology research and development program with zybrestat  the objective of which is to develop a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmological diseases and conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that results in loss of vision 
we believe that a safe  effective and convenient topically administered anti vascular therapeutic would have advantages over 
table of contents currently approved anti vascular  ophthalmological therapeutics  which must be injected directly into patients eyes  in some cases on a chronic monthly basis 
in june  we initiated a randomized  double masked  placebo controlled phase ii proof of mechanism trial  which we refer to as the favor trial  with intravenously administered zybrestat in patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy pcv  a form of choroidal neovascularization against which current therapies  including approved anti angiogenic drugs  appear to provide limited benefit 
the main clinical indication in this disease is a form of polyps formed in the retina of patients which are made up of vessels that have properties very similar to tumor vasculature 
the effect of zybrestat on the polyps is being visualized and documented as part of the study 
in parallel with the favor trial  we are currently conducting preclinical toxicology and efficacy studies with zybrestat  administered via topical ophthalmological formulations 
the favor study will continue with an expected interim analysis in the first half of further development of this program will depend on the outcome of the interim analysis and review experts in the field as well as by our management 
we believe the architecture of the abnormal vasculature in the retina and choroid that contributes to pcv patients loss of vision may be particularly susceptible to treatment with a vda such as zybrestat 
we believe that pcv represents an attractive target indication and development pathway for zybrestat 
unlike wet age related macular degeneration  an indication for which several anti angiogenic drugs are approved or prescribed off label  conducting clinical studies of zybrestat in patients with ophthalmologic indications not yet approved treatment for such anti angiogenic drugs could potentially prove to reduce development time and expense 
the objectives of the favor trial and the ongoing preclinical program are to determine the therapeutic utility of zybrestat in pcv  visualize the effect of zybrestat on the vasculature of the polyps associated with pcv  determine blood concentrations of drug required for activity in humans and thereby estimate  with the benefit of preclinical data  an appropriate dose of topically administered zybrestat to be evaluated in subsequent human clinical studies  and further evaluate the feasibility of and reduce the risk associated with developing a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmological indications 
to date  we have completed preclinical experiments demonstrating that zybrestat has activity in six different preclinical ophthalmology models  including a model in which zybrestat was combined with an approved anti angiogenic drug 
we have also completed multiple preclinical studies suggesting that zybrestat  when applied topically to the surface of the eye at doses that appear to be well tolerated  penetrates to the retina and choroid in quantities that we believe should be more than sufficient for therapeutic activity 
finally  we have completed and reported results at the annual meeting of the association for research in vision and ophthalmology  or arvo  from a phase ii study in patients with myopic macular degeneration in which all patients in the study met the primary clinical endpoint of vision stabilization at three months after study entry 
based on results of its preclinical trials  we believe that a topically applied formulation of zybrestat eg  an eye drop or other topical formulation is feasible and may have clinical utility in the treatment of patients with a variety of ophthalmological diseases and conditions  such as pcv  age related macular degeneration  diabetic retinopathy and neovascular glaucoma  all of which are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth and associated loss of vision 
in addition to having potential utility for treating ocular diseases and conditions that affect tissues in the back of the eye  we believe that a topical ophthalmological formulation of zybrestat could also have utility for the treatment of other ocular diseases and conditions characterized by abnormal neovascularization that affect tissues in the front of the eye  such as the cornea and iris 
although several anti angiogenic therapeutics have been approved and are marketed for ophthalmological indications in which patients are experiencing active disease  the requirement that these therapeutics be 
table of contents injected directly into the eye on a repeated basis is a significant limitation for some patients and may result in serious side effects 
we believe that a topical formulation of zybrestat may decrease the requirement for or possibly even replace the use of medications injected into the eye  have utility for treating patients with newly developed and or less severe forms of neovascular ophthalmological diseases and conditions  which could potentially prevent these patients from developing active and or severe forms of the disease that result in vision loss  and have utility in patients with neovascular ophthalmological diseases and conditions that do not respond well to treatment with currently available therapeutics 
financial resources we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from our inception through december  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years  principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures 
the principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options 
we currently have no material amount of licensing or other fee income 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents 
during our fiscal  we primarily invested in obligations issued by us treasury and federal agencies  obligations of commercial banks and commercial paper 
in fiscal  we plan to continue to employ a conservative investment strategy 
on march  we entered into a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors to sell  shares of our common stock and  separately  a series of warrants to purchase common stock in a private placement 
gross proceeds of the financing were approximately  before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses  and assuming no exercise of the warrants 
existing cash plus the addition of this capital is expected to support our operations through the third quarter of  assuming that we achieve the planned cost reductions from our february restructuring 
we will require significant additional funding to remain a going concern and to fund operations until such time  if ever  we become profitable 
however  there can be no assurance that adequate additional financing will be available to us on terms that we deem acceptable  if at all 
our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalties or other revenue generated by us from commercial sales of our potential products are not expected for several years  if at all 
including the capital raised in march  our cash position has become particularly acute in light of the termination of the vaxgen merger agreement  which occurred following the failure of the vaxgen stockholders to vote in favor of the merger 
following the termination of the vaxgen transaction  on february   we announced a restructuring of our clinical development programs 
this restructuring plan is designed to focus our resources on our highest value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization 
this restructuring includes a plan to stop further enrollment our phase anaplastic thyroid cancer clinical trial fact and a reduction in our work force of approximately employees 
in addition  the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of our ongoing clinical studies and our cash resources at that time 
we expect to incur a one time charge in connection with the reduction of its work force of approximately  in the first quarter of for severance pay and benefits to those former employees affected by the reduction 
this re alignment of priorities in clinical programs together with the reduction in force is expected to reduce the cash required to operate our business from the current level of between  and  per quarter to between  and  per quarter by the second half of we expect to continue to pursue strategic alliances and consider collaborative development opportunities that may provide us with access to organizations that have capabilities and or products that are complementary to our own  in order to continue the development of our potential product candidates 
however  there can be 
table of contents no assurances that we will complete any strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements  and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us 
on october   we announced a strategic collaboration with symphony capital partners  lp symphony  a private equity firm  under which symphony agreed to provide up to  in funding to support the advancement of zybrestat for oncology  zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi under this collaboration  we entered into a series of related agreements with symphony capital llc  symphony vida  inc  or vida  symphony vida holdings llc  or holdings  and related entities 
pursuant to these agreements  holdings formed and capitalized vida  a delaware corporation  in order a to hold certain intellectual property related to two of our product candidates  zybrestat for opthalmology and oxi  which were exclusively licensed to vida under a novated and restated technology license agreement and b to fund commitments of up to  the funding was planned to support pre clinical and clinical development conducted by us  on behalf of vida  for zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi on july   we entered into a series of related agreements with holdings and vida pursuant to which such parties agreed to amend the terms of the purchase option  as set forth in an amended and restated purchase option agreement the amended purchase option agreement 
in connection with such amendment  we also entered into  with holdings  an amended and restated registration rights agreement 
under the amended purchase option agreement  we issued  newly issued shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the equity of vida 
we re acquired all of the rights to the zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi programs that had been licensed to vida 
in addition  the approximately  in cash and marketable securities held by vida was transferred to us 
after exercising the purchase option  vida became our wholly owned subsidiary and ceased being a variable interest entity 
we recorded the acquisition of vida as a capital transaction and the  excess of the fair market value of the common stock issued by us  over the carrying value of the non controlling interest  is reflected directly in equity as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
as a result  the non controlling interest balance was eliminated 
the reduction to additional paid in capital was also presented as an increase in the loss applicable to common stock within the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
in february  we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital  which was subsequently amended in february under the terms of the amended ceff  kingsbridge committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  up to  shares of the company s common stock or up to an aggregate of  during the period which ends may  under the ceff  we are able to draw down in tranches of up to a maximum of percent of our closing market value at the time of the draw down or the alternative draw down amount calculated pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement whichever is less  subject to certain conditions 
the purchase price of these shares is discounted between to percent from the volume weighted average price of our common stock for each of the eight trading days following the election to sell shares 
kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares at prices below per share or at a price below of the closing share price of our stock in the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the draw down  whichever is higher 
in connection with the ceff  in  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share exercisable beginning six months after february  for a period of five years thereafter 
as of december   there remain a total of  shares available for sale under the ceff 
the actual and planned uses of proceeds from all of the above financings include the continued development of our two lead product candidates  zybrestat and oxi  in oncology and ophthalmology 
we are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base  with development  scientific  finance and administrative functions  which include  among other things  product development  regulatory oversight and clinical testing 
our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently 
accordingly  we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs 
table of contents on a project by project basis 
we conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities 
regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third party  specialty organizations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
initial symphony transaction on october   we announced a strategic collaboration with symphony capital partners  lp a private equity firm that agreed to provide up to  in funding to support the advancement of zybrestat for oncology  zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi under this collaboration  we entered into a series of related agreements with symphony capital llc  or symphony  symphony vida  inc  or vida  symphony vida holdings llc  or holdings  and related entities  including the following purchase option agreement  research and development agreement  amended and restated research and development agreement  technology license agreement  novated and restated technology license agreement  confidentiality agreement  and additional funding agreement 
in addition  oxigene entered into a series of related agreements with holdings  including the following stock and warrant purchase agreement  warrant to purchase up to  shares of oxigene common stock at per share  which was issued on october  and subsequently exercised in full on december  following shareholder approval of the symphony transaction  and  registration rights agreement 
pursuant to these agreements  holdings had formed and capitalized vida  a delaware corporation  in order a to hold certain intellectual property related to two of our product candidates  zybrestat for use in ophthalmologic indications and oxi  referred to as the programs  which were exclusively licensed to vida under the novated and restated technology license agreement and b to fund commitments of up to  the funding supported pre clinical and clinical development by us  on behalf of vida  for the programs 
under certain circumstances  we could have been required  under the additioanl funding agreement  to commit up to  to vida 
our requirement for additional funding was to be 
table of contents determined by a number of factors  including among others  if at all  the determination of the need for more funding and the written recommendation of the joint development committee jdc  the approval of the symphony vida board  the probability and amount of the additional funding provided by holdings  if any  the probability that we may provide optional funding optional company funding  and the timing of meeting the potential obligations 
pursuant to the agreements  we continued to be primarily responsible for all pre clinical and clinical development efforts as well as maintenance of the intellectual property portfolio for the programs 
oxigene and vida established a development committee to oversee the programs 
we participated in the development committee and had the right to appoint one of the five directors of vida 
the purchase option agreement provided for the exclusive right  but not the obligation  for us to repurchase both the programs by acquiring of the equity of vida at any time between october  and march  for an amount equal to two times the amount of capital actually invested by symphony in vida  less certain amounts 
if we did not exercise its exclusive right with respect to the purchase of the programs licensed under the agreement with vida  rights to the programs at the end of the development period would have remained with vida 
in consideration for the purchase option  we issued to holdings  shares of its common stock and paid approximately  for structuring fees and related expenses to symphony 
acquisition of vida pursuant to an amended and restated purchase option agreement on july   holdings and vida entered into a series of related agreements with us pursuant to which such parties agreed to amend the terms of the purchase option  as set forth in an amended and restated purchase option agreement the amended purchase option agreement 
in connection with such amendment  holdings and us also entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement the amended registration rights agreement and together with the amended and restated purchase option agreement  the transaction documents 
under the amended purchase option agreement  we issued  newly issued shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the equity of vida  which included further consideration for additional securities issued in connection with the registered direct offering 
we re acquired all of the rights to the programs that had been licensed in to vida 
in addition  the approximately  in cash and marketable securities held by vida was transferred to us 
after exercising the purchase option  vida became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and ceased being a variable interest entity vie  see further discussion below 
we recorded the acquisition of vida as a capital transaction and the  excess of the fair market value of the common shares issued by us  over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest  was reflected directly in equity as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
as a result  the noncontrolling interest balance was eliminated 
the reduction to additional paid in capital was also presented as an increase in the loss applicable to common stock within the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
under the amended purchase option agreement  in the event that we issued additional securities prior to january   symphony had the right to receive additional securities from us 
symphony has already received additional consideration under the amended purchase option agreement in connection with the registered direct offering on july  pursuant to those transactions  oxigene issued to holdings  newly issued shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the equity of vida 
these  shares included consideration to holdings for the additional shares issued in the registered direct 
holdings right to receive further consideration  in the event that we issued additional securities expired on january  no further consideration was earned by holdings under this right 
the two members of the company s board of directors appointed by symphony  mr 
mark kessel and dr 
alastair wood  remain on the board of directors  and we maintain the advisory relationships with symphony and rrd international llc 
the additional funding agreement  dated october   has been terminated in connection with the execution of the transaction documents pursuant to the termination agreement dated july  the closing of the transaction occurred on july  
table of contents consolidation of variable interest entity vie we consolidated the financial position and results of operations of symphony vida  inc vida from october  when it entered into a strategic collaboration with symphony vida holdings  llc symphony  until july  when we acquired of vida pursuant to an amended and restated purchase option agreement 
the funding supported pre clinical and clinical development by us  on behalf of vida  for zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi a variable interest entity vie is an entity that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or an entity that has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the expected losses or do not receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
a vie should be consolidated by the party that is deemed to be the primary beneficiary  which is the party that has exposure to a majority of the potential variability in the vie s outcomes 
the application of accounting policy to a given arrangement requires significant management judgment 
we consolidated the financial position and results of operations of vida in accordance with proper accounting guidance 
we believe vida was by design a vie because we had a purchase option to acquire its outstanding voting stock at prices that are fixed based upon the date the option is exercised 
the fixed nature of the purchase option price limited symphony s returns  as the investor in vida 
further  due to the direct investment from holdings in our common stock  as a related party vida was a vie of which we were the primary beneficiary 
after we exercised the purchase option  vida became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and ceased being a vie 
accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests on january   we adopted retrospectively for all periods presented the new presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests required by asc consolidations 
under asc  earnings or losses attributed to the noncontrolling interests are reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense 
accordingly  we reported the consolidated earnings of vida in its consolidated statement of operations from october  when we entered into a strategic collaboration with symphony  until july   when we acquired of the equity of vida pursuant to the amended and restated purchase option agreement 
once becoming our wholly owned subsidiary  the operating results of vida continued to be included in our consolidated statement of operations but were no longer subject to the presentation requirements applicable to noncontrolling interests 
losses incurred by vida  and attributable to symphony  were charged to the noncontrolling interest 
at december   the noncontrolling interest balance was  losses charged to the noncontrolling interest in fiscal of  left the carrying balance of  which was eliminated with the acquisition 
see acquisition of vida pursuant to an amended and restated purchase option agreement above 
committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital limited in february  we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital  which was subsequently amended in february to increase the commitment period  increase the draw down discount price and increase the maximum draw period 
under the terms of the amended ceff  kingsbridge committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  up to  shares of our common stock or up to an aggregate of  during the period which ends may  under the ceff  we are able to draw down in tranches of up to a maximum of percent of our closing market value at the time of the draw down or the alternative draw down amount calculated pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement whichever is less  subject to certain conditions 
the purchase price of these shares is discounted between to percent from the volume weighted average price of our common stock for each of the eight trading days following the election to sell shares 
kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares at prices below per share or at a price below of the closing 
table of contents share price our stock in the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the draw down  whichever is higher 
in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share exercisable beginning six months after february  for a period of five years thereafter 
see accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in the company s common stock  below 
as of december   there remain a total of  shares available for sale under the ceff 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in the company s common stock in connection with the strategic collaboration with symphony in october discussed above  we issued to holdings  a warrant the direct investment warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share  the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on september   the day before the consummation of the symphony transaction 
the term of this warrant was ten years from the date of issuance or until october  this warrant was exercised on december  subsequent to the approval of issuance of common stock underlying the warrant by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders on december  in addition  we agreed that should the development committee of vida determine that vida needs additional funding and that funding is provided by holdings  we would issue to holdings shares of our common stock having a value of up to  the additional investment shares on the date of issuance 
because the closing price of our common stock as of the additional closing date was not determinable  the number of potential shares issuable to holdings to satisfy this  additional investment shares obligation would not be known and there was a possibility that the number of shares necessary to settle the additional investment shares obligation would be greater than the number of shares that we had authorized 
in february  we issued five year warrants exercisable beginning in august to kingsbridge capital limited in consideration for entering into a committed equity financing facility ceff 
through these warrants the ceff warrants  kingsbridge may purchase from us up to  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
as of december   none of these warrants had been exercised 
due to the indeterminable number of shares required to meet the additional investment shares obligation  we determined that we may not have sufficient authorized shares to settle our outstanding financial instruments 
our policy with regard to settling outstanding financial instruments is to settle those with the earliest maturity date first which essentially sets the order of preference for settling the awards 
accordingly  we accounted for the direct investment warrant  additional investment shares and ceff warrant collectively the derivative instruments as liabilities 
we began the treatment of these derivative instruments as liabilities excluding the direct registration warrants which  as discussed below  were not issued until july as of october   the initial funding and effective date of the symphony transaction 
establishing the value of these derivative instruments is an inherently subjective process 
the value of both the direct investment warrant and the ceff warrant are determined using the black scholes option model 
the value of the additional investment shares is determined by considering a number of factors  including among others  the probability and amount of the additional funding provided by holdings  if any  the probability that we would provide the additional funding amount  and the timing of meeting the potential obligation 
differences in value from one measurement date to another were recorded as other income expense in our statement of operations 
in october  we recorded a  liability for the fair value of the derivative instruments 
we remeasured the derivative instruments excluding the direct registration warrants which  as discussed below  were not issued until july as of december  resulting in a gain of  as a result of the change in fair value of the direct investment and the kingsbridge ceff warrants 
as of june   the additional investment shares had a fair value of zero as a result of the additional funding agreement being terminated by us through the amended and restated purchase option 
table of contents agreement executed on july  as a result of the additional investment share obligation being terminated  the possibility that we may not have sufficient authorized shares to settle our outstanding financial instruments was eliminated 
in fiscal year  the change in fair value of the additional investment shares resulted in a non cash gain of  as of july   we re measured the fair value of the ceff warrants and reclassified the warrants to equity 
in fiscal year  the change in fair value of the ceff warrants resulted in a non cash loss of  direct registration warrants on july   we raised approximately  in gross proceeds  before deducting placement agents fees and other offering expenses  in a registered direct offering the offering relating to the sale of  units  each unit consisting of i one share of common stock  ii a five year warrant direct registration series i to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share of common stock and iii a short term warrant direct registration series ii to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share of common stock  for a purchase price of per unit the units 
the short term warrants are exercisable during a period beginning on the date of issuance until the later of a nine months from the date of issuance and b ten trading days after the earlier of i the public announcement of the outcome of the planned interim analysis by the independent data safety monitoring committee of data from our phase ii iii pivotal clinical trial regarding zybrestat as a treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer or ii the public announcement of the suspension  termination or abandonment of such trial for any reason 
the units were offered and sold pursuant to i a prospectus dated december  and ii a prospectus supplement dated july   pursuant to and forming a part of our effective shelf registration statement on form s registration no 

the net proceeds to the company from the sale of the units  after deducting the fees of the placement agents and other offering expenses  were approximately  we determined that the direct registration series i and ii warrants should be classified as a liability as they require delivery of registered shares of common stock and thus could require net cash settlement in certain circumstances 
accordingly  these warrants were recorded as a liability at their fair value as of the date of their issuance of  and are revalued at each subsequent reporting date 
as of december  the warrants are valued at  the change in fair value between the issuance date and december  of  was recorded as a non cash gain in the statement of operations 
reclassifications prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation to reflect an allocation of facilities related costs from general and administrative expenses to research and development expenses 
for the years ended december  and  approximately  and  respectively  were reclassified to research and development expenses 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
concentration of credit risk we have no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents 
we hold our cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution 

table of contents cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
we have  that is used to secure financing through a company credit card 
this amount is separated from cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet 
available for sale securities we view our marketable securities as available for use in our current operations  and accordingly designate our marketable securities as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we review the status of the unrealized gains and losses of our available for sale marketable securities on a regular basis 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in investment income 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in investment income 
securities in an unrealized loss position deemed not to be other than temporarily impaired  due to management s positive intent and ability to hold the securities until anticipated recovery  with maturation greater than twelve months are classified as long term assets 
accrued clinical costs we charge all research and development expenses  both internal and external costs  to operations as incurred 
our research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations  product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of our potential product candidates 
we recognize expense associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts 
costs incurred under fixed fee contracts are accrued ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably 
costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patients treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract 
in determining costs incurred on some of these programs  we take into consideration a number of factors  including estimates and input provided by our internal program managers 
upon termination of such contracts  we are normally only liable for costs incurred or committed to date 
as a result  accrued research and development expenses represent our estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any of the relevant times 
any advance payments for goods or services to be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement are properly classified as prepaid until such goods or services are rendered 
impairment of long lived assets on august   we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
the present value of the amount payable under the license agreement has been capitalized based on a discounted cash flow model and is being amortized over the term of the agreement approximately years 
management is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long lived assets if triggering events occur 
we review for such triggering events periodically and  even though triggering events such as a going concern opinion and continuing losses occurred  we have determined that there is no impairment to this asset during the years ended up to and including december  in addition  the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals  which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement 
to date no clinical trials triggering payments under the agreement have been completed and no regulatory approvals have been obtained 
we expense these payments to research and development in the period that payment becomes both probable and estimable 

table of contents stock based compensation we record the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share based payments issued to employees 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we used the black scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price  the expected term of the option  the grant date price of our common stock  which is issuable upon exercise of the option  the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term 
stock option exercise price grant date price of our common stock the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
expected term the expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time expected volatility the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted 
we determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term 
expected dividends because we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant 
of the variables above  the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
in the years ended december  and  respectively  we granted options to purchase  and  shares of our common stock valued using these assumptions 
the majority of the stock option expense recorded in these periods relates to continued vesting of stock options and restricted stock that were granted after january  the grant date estimates of fair value associated with prior awards  which were also calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  have not been changed 
the specific valuation assumptions that were utilized for purposes of deriving an estimate of fair value at the time that prior awards were issued are disclosed in footnote we are required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
this requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested  including awards granted prior to january  accordingly  we performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting  and ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate 
in our calculation  we segregated participants into two distinct groups  directors and officers and employees  and our estimated forfeiture rates were calculated at and  respectively using the straight line uniform method 
this analysis will be re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary 

table of contents employee stock purchase plan in may  our stockholders approved the espp 
under the espp  employees have the option to purchase shares of our common stock at of the closing price on the first day of each purchase period or the last day of each purchase period as defined in the espp  whichever is lower  up to specified limits 
eligible employees are given the option to purchase shares of our common stock  on a tax favored basis  through regular payroll deductions in compliance with section of the code 
an aggregate of  shares of common stock may be issued under the espp  subject to adjustment each year pursuant to the terms of the espp

 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas  which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements

results of operations years ended december  and revenues we recognized approximately  in licensing revenue in the year ended december   in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology 
we did not recognize any license revenue in the year ended december  future revenues  if any  from this license agreement are expected to continue to be minimal 
our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to  and generate revenues from products currently under development by us 
we expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue in fiscal unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up front payments

restructuring plan we announced on february  a restructuring plan designed to focus resources on our highest value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization 
key aspects of the restructuring and its effects on our current clinical trials are as follows we will continue to advance our high priority phase zybrestat trial in non small cell lung cancer falcon study  with updated safety and efficacy results anticipated for presentation at the upcoming american society of clinical oncology asco meeting in june we plan to stop further enrollment in the phase fact clinical trial in anaplastic thyroid cancer atc  but will continue to treat and follow all patients who are currently enrolled 
a survival analysis is anticipated in early we expect this plan to optimize our ability to gain useful additional insight into zybrestat s antitumor activity earlier than the previously anticipated timeline  while also reducing cash utilization in and subsequent years

investment income decreased by approximately  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  primarily due to a combination of lower average cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities balances during and by lower average interest rates and returns on investments 
liquidity and capital resources we will require significant additional funding to remain a going concern and to fund operations 
to date  we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financing and in fiscal years and  from research and development services provided to symphony vida inc in july  we completed the purchase of symphony vida  inc  which resulted in the transfer to us of approximately  in cash and marketable securities held by symphony vida  inc and we completed a registered direct offering of our common stock and warrants resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately  we have experienced net losses and negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception  except in fiscal as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to incur increased expenses  resulting in losses  over at least the next several years due to  among other factors  our continuing and planned clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities

this restructuring plan is designed to focus our resources on our highest value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization 
this restructuring includes a plan to stop further enrollment in the our phase anaplastic thyroid cancer clinical trial fact and a reduction in our work force of approximately employees 
in addition  the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of these ongoing clinical studies and our cash resources at that time 
we expect to incur a one time charge in connection with the reduction of our work force of approximately  in the first quarter of for severance pay and benefits to those former employees affected by the reduction 
this re alignment of priorities in clinical programs together with the reduction in force is expected to reduce the cash required to operate our business from the current level of between  and  per quarter to between  and  per quarter by the second half of on july   we raised approximately  in gross proceeds  before deducting placement agents fees and other offering expenses  in a registered direct offering relating to the sale of  units  
table of contents each unit consisting of i one share of common stock  ii a five year warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share of common stock and iii a short term warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share of common stock  for a purchase price of per unit 
the short term warrants are exercisable during a period beginning on the date of issuance until the later of a nine months from the date of issuance and b ten trading days after the earlier of i the public announcement of the outcome of the planned interim analysis by the independent data safety monitoring committee of data from our phase ii iii pivotal clinical trial regarding zybrestat as a treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer or ii the public announcement of the suspension  termination or abandonment of such trial for any reason 
the net proceeds to us from the sale of the units  after deducting the fees of the placement agents and other offering expenses  were approximately  also in july  under an amended purchase option agreement  we issued  newly issued shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the equity in the symphony vida 
we re acquired all of the rights to the zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi programs that had been licensed to vida 
in addition  the approximately  in cash and marketable securities held by vida was transferred to us 
we recorded the acquisition of vida as a capital transaction and the  excess of the fair market value of the common shares issued by us  over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest  is reflected directly in equity as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
as a result  the noncontrolling interest balance was eliminated 
the reduction to additional paid in capital was also presented as an increase in the loss applicable to common stock within the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
on march  we entered into a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors to sell  shares of our common stock and  separately  a series of warrants to purchase common stock in a private placement 
gross proceeds of the financing were approximately  before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses  and assuming no exercise of the warrants 
we anticipate that our existing cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents of  as of december   along with the capital raised in march and investment income earned thereon  will enable us to fund currently planned operations through the third quarter of  assuming that we achieve the planned cost reductions from our february restructuring 
our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on the progress of our potential product development programs  particularly  the results of our pre clinical projects  the cost timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the terms and conditions of our contracts with service providers for these programs  the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials  much of which is not within our control as well as the timing of hiring development staff to support our product development plans 
the anticipated reduction in our cash utilization  resulting from our restructuring plans  is highly dependent on the timeliness and effectiveness of renegotiating our contracts with the vendors and service providers involved with the restructuring plans 
we intend to aggressively pursue other forms of capital infusion including strategic alliances with organizations that have capabilities and or products that are complementary to our own  in order to continue the development of our potential product candidates 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned for or anticipated by management due to numerous risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the progress of and results of our pre clinical testing and clinical trials of our vda drug candidates under development  including zybrestat  our lead drug candidate  and oxi  the progress of our research and development programs  the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals  the resources  if any  that we devote to developing manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  our ability to enter into licensing arrangements  including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs  the costs and expenses of filing  prosecuting and  if necessary  enforcing our patent claims  or defending ourselves against possible claims of infringement by us of third party patent or other technology rights  the costs of commercialization activities and arrangements  if any  undertaken by us  and  if and when approved  the demand for our products  which demand is dependent in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known  understood 
table of contents or quantified unless and until the time of approval  for example the range of indications for which any product is granted approval 
we will need to raise additional funds to support our operations to remain a going concern past the third quarter  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands less than after total year years years years clinical development and related committements operating leases total contractual cash obligations payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract 
the amounts in the table above assume the successful completion  by the third party contractor  of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements 
in addition  not included in operating leases above  is sublease income which totals approximately  for fiscal our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called combretastatins 
in august  we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
this agreement was subsequently amended in june from the inception of the agreement through december   we have paid a total of  in connection with this license 
the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals  which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones  as defined in the agreement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments  commodity based instruments or other long term debt obligations 
we account for the direct registration warrants as liabilities and as of december  they are valued at  we have adopted an investment policy  the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in us dollar accounts 
although we conduct a number of our trials and studies outside of the 
table of contents united states  we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be limited as the arrangements are in jurisdictions with relatively stable currencies
