item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
amounts in thousands  except per share data in addition to historical information  this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties  discussed in the section entitled item a risk factors  and the note regarding forward looking statements  included at the beginning of this form k 
the risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of biologic therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with severe and life threatening disease states  including hematologic  kidney and neurologic diseases  transplant rejection  cancer and autoimmune disorders 
our marketed product soliris eculizumab is the first and only therapy approved for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  or pnh 
soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic hematologic  kidney and neurological disorders  transplant rejection  and autoimmune disorders 
soliris is a humanized monoclonal antibody that generally blocks complement activity for one to two weeks after a single dose at the doses currently prescribed 
the initial indication for which we received approval for soliris is pnh 
pnh is a rare  debilitating and life threatening  acquired genetic deficiency blood disorder defined by the destruction of red blood cells  or hemolysis 
the chronic hemolysis in patients with pnh may be associated with life threatening thromboses  recurrent pain  kidney disease  disabling fatigue  impaired quality of life  severe anemia  pulmonary hypertension  shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark colored urine hemoglobinuria 
soliris was granted marketing approval by the us food and drug administration  or fda  and by the european commission  or ec  in and now has received approval in several other countries throughout the world 
additionally  soliris was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of pnh in the united states  europe  japan and several other territories 
in  the fda and ec granted soliris orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  or ahus  a rare  inherited  and life threatening complement inhibitor deficiency disease that often progresses to end stage kidney disease or failure 
alexion is currently enrolling patients in four clinical studies of soliris as an investigational treatment for adolescent and adult patients with ahus 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  business overview and summary of significant accounting policies 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the judgments  estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition royalties inventories research and development expenses stock based compensation income taxes revenue recognition net product sales our principal source of revenue is product sales 
we have applied the following principles in recognizing revenue to date  our product sales have consisted solely of soliris 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities  which are primarily comprised of value added taxes vat in foreign jurisdictions  are presented on a net basis in the company s statements of operations  and do not impact net product sales 
in the united states  our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies who supply physician office clinics  hospital outpatient clinics  infusion clinics or home health care providers 
in some cases  we also sell soliris to government agencies 
outside the united states  our customers are primarily hospitals  hospital buying groups  pharmacies  other health care providers and distributors 
in addition to sales where soliris is commercially available  we have also recorded revenue on sales for individual patients through named patient programs outside the united states 
the relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where soliris has not received final approval for commercial sales 
because of the pricing of soliris  the limited number of patients  the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights  soliris customers generally carry limited inventory 
we monitor inventory within our distribution channel to determine whether deferral of sales is required 
to date  actual refunds and returns have been negligible 
we record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs  including medicaid and programs in europe  as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
our calculations related to these rebate accruals require estimates  including estimates of customer mix  to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments 
generally  the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months 
upon review of historical rebate payments compared to our accruals  we revise our estimates of rebates payable  which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made 
we have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the years ended december   and as follows rebates payable balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  we record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue 
these costs are typically known at the time of sale  resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale 
royalties our cost of sales includes royalties to third parties related to the sale and commercial manufacture of soliris 
we estimate our royalty obligations based on existing contractual obligations and our assessment of estimated royalties owed to other third parties 
these estimates may be influenced by the outcome of future litigation or other claims  if any  the results of which are uncertain 
on a periodic basis and based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims  we may reassess these estimates  resulting in adjustments to cost of sales 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method 
for products that are in initial clinical development  we capitalize inventory costs prior to regulatory approval  but subsequent to the filing of the biologics license application  or bla  when we determine that the inventory has probable future economic benefit 
inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a phase iii clinical trial 
we also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at our manufacturing plant in property  plant and equipment prior to approval of the facility by regulatory authorities 
we analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value  or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements 
although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control  certain batches or units of product may  after a period of time  no longer meet quality specifications or may expire  at which point we would adjust our inventory values 
soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of months and  based on our sales forecasts  we expect to realize the carrying value of the soliris inventory 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management 
a critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements based on internal sales forecasts 
we then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand 
to the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold  we will write down the value of inventory 
if actual results differ from those estimates  additional inventory write offs may be required 
in the future  reduced demand  quality issues or excess supply beyond those anticipated by management may result in an adjustment to inventory levels  which would be recorded as an increase to cost of sales 
research and development expenses we accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations cro s  clinical study sites  laboratories  consultants  or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities 
related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through close communication with the cro s and other clinical trial vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules  and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed 
certain cro and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial 
the estimates are reviewed and discussed with the cro or vendor as necessary  and are included in research and development expenses for the related period 
for clinical study sites  which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter 
the estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced  which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed 
stock based compensation we have one stock based compensation plan known as the incentive plan 
under this plan  restricted stock  restricted stock units  stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors  officers  employees and consultants or advisors of the company or any subsidiary 
our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the black scholes model 
the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility 
we also estimate expected term until exercise  forfeiture or cancellation  as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures 
we currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life 
actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we follow the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject to material adjustments until matters are resolved with taxing authorities or statutes expire 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed the valuation allowance recorded against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the united states  resulting in a tax benefit of  the decision to reverse the valuation allowance was made after management determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized 
we made the determination after evaluation of our levels of recent profitability  as well as forecasts of future taxable income which impact utilization of tax attributes  primarily net operating losses and research income tax credits 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where realizability is not certain 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
if we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period  we would record material changes to income tax expense in that period 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 
this information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
year ended december  revenues net product sales contract research revenue total revenues cost of sales research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss earnings loss per common share basic diluted comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues during the year ended december   we recorded sales of soliris in the united states of  and outside the united states of  we recorded a gain of  related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program  included in revenue from outside the united states 
during the year ended december   we recorded sales of soliris in the united states of  and outside the united states of  we recorded a gain of  related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program  included in revenue from outside the united states 
the increases in revenue for fiscal year versus were due to an increased number of patients treated with soliris in the united states and outside the united states 
as additional physicians request soliris and as governmental reimbursement for soliris is provided for in more territories  we expect that the number of patients receiving soliris treatment will increase  resulting in an increase in product sales in existing countries 
we also expect product sales in the rest of the world to increase as we progress with appropriate authorities on the regulatory  price approval and reimbursement process in additional territories 
we recorded no contract research revenues in the year ended december  and for the year ended december  cost of sales cost of sales was  and  or and of product revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of soliris 
on a periodic basis and based on events such as the outcome of litigation  we may reassess the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods 
research and development expenses our research and development expense includes personnel  facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates  as well as product development costs 
we group our research and development expenses into two major categories external direct expenses and all other r d expenses 
external direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development  product development and discovery research 
clinical development costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to eculizumab and other product candidates 
product development costs are those incurred in performing duties related to pre and post approval manufacturing development and regulatory functions 
discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of eculizumab and other product candidates 
clinical development costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs  while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been allocated directly to each program 
the following table provides information regarding research and development expenses year ended december  year ended december  variance variance clinical development product development discovery research total external direct expenses labor expenses operating and occupancy depreciation and amortization total other r d expenses research and development expense the following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs 
please refer to item  business  for a description of each of these programs year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  accumulated expenditures since january  external direct expenses soliris pnh program soliris non pnh programs samalizumab pexelizumab unallocated prior to january   we spent approximately  on all research development programs 
substantially all of our research and development expenses prior to the year ended december  were related to two products  eculizumab and pexelizumab 
we obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of pnh in in the united states and european union  and we made the decision to cease development of pexelizumab in expenses for the pexelizumab program recorded in related to the termination of the program 
the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs 
we could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated 
for additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs  please refer to the risk factors in this form k 
during the year ended december   we incurred research and development expenses of  an increase of  or versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following increase of  in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our expanding number of clinical programs and manufacturing and product development activities at our production facility in smithfield ri 
increase of  external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab for non pnh indications  as well as growth of our samalizumab program  offset by decreases in spending on the pnh program see table above 
increase of  in external product development expenses related primarily to increases in manufacturing development activities at our production facility in smithfield ri 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase  at a lower rate than our revenue  in due to clinical development and manufacturing costs related to our expanding eculizumab and samalizumab development programs 
for additional information on these programs  please refer to product and development programs in item i of this form k 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expense includes commercial and administrative personnel  corporate facility and external costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products 
these selling  general and administrative costs include corporate facility operating expenses and depreciation  marketing and sales operations in support of soliris  human resources  finance  legal  information technology and support personnel expenses  and other corporate costs such as telecommunications  insurance  audit and legal expenses 
during the year ended december   we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of  an increase of  or  versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following during the year ended december   salaries  benefits and other labor expenses increased to  an increase of  or  versus  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities  including increases in payroll and benefits costs of  related to our global commercial operations teams 
other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive  finance  information technology  human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity 
increase in external selling  general and administrative expenses of  was due primarily to increases in marketing and consulting services of  travel costs of  occupancy and depreciation expenses of  relating to new and expanded office space in europe  japan  canada  australia and latin america and  in telecommunications and information technology expenses 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase  at a lower rate than our revenue  in  reflecting our growth as a commercial organization throughout the world 
other income expense during the year ended december   we recognized of foreign currency loss  an increase of  versus a loss of incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs 
during the year ended december   investment income decreased  or to due primarily to reduced interest rates earned in money market funds 
during the year ended december   interest expense decreased  or  to due primarily to lower principal balance of our convertible notes as a result of the note conversion in october and exchange in april and may during the year ended december   interest expense decreased  or  to due primarily to lower principal balance of our convertible notes as a result of the note conversion in october and exchange in april and may income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to a provision of  for the year ended december  the tax benefit reported in includes a benefit of  attributable to the release of valuation allowances against us deferred tax assets  offset principally by income tax provisions for profitable foreign subsidiaries 
the valuation allowance was reversed after management determined that a significant portion of the deferred tax assets relating to the united states would be realized 
we made the determination after evaluation of our levels of recent profitability  as well as forecasts of future taxable income which impact utilization of tax attributes  primarily net operating losses and research income tax credits 
the income tax provision for is principally attributable to entities in certain foreign jurisdictions who achieved profitability during the year  offset by the reversal of valuation allowances in those foreign jurisdictions and the exchange of federal research credits for cash 
due to reversal of the valuation allowance during the year ended december   we will record income taxes at an effective tax rate  starting in  which is significantly higher than historical tax rates 
the company was granted an incentive tax holiday in the canton of vaud in switzerland effective january   with a final expiration date in the tax holiday will exempt the company from most local corporate income taxes in switzerland through the end of and is expected to be renewed for an additional years

cost of sales includes actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of soliris  as well as other manufacturing costs 
changes in the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods 
product sold during the year ended december  included inventory that was previously expensed prior to submission of our bla and therefore is not included in the cost of sales during this period 
during the fourth quarter of  we exhausted the supply of previously expensed inventory 
beginning in  our cost of sales reflected the full manufacturing cost of the inventory 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a patent license agreement and settlement agreement with pdl biopharma in which we were obligated to pay a total of  for a fully paid  perpetual license 
as a result of the settlement and evaluation of other potential royalties  we recorded a reduction in cost of goods sold of approximately  related to an adjustment of estimated accrued royalties for sales of soliris prior to the fourth quarter

decrease of  external clinical development expenses related primarily to termination of our pexelizumab program in and decreases in spending for soliris for pnh 
these are offset by the expansion of studies of eculizumab for non pnh indications  as well as growth of our samalizumab program see table above 
decrease of  in discovery research was primarily due to a reduction in external research and consulting fees 
increase of in depreciation and amortization related primarily to the amortization of costs associated with our new pilot plant located at our manufacturing facility in smithfield  ri  which was placed in service in the fourth quarter selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of  an increase of  or versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following during the year ended december   salaries  benefits and other labor expenses increased to  an increase of  or  versus  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities  including increases in payroll and benefits costs of  related to our global commercial operations teams 
other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive  finance  information technology  human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity 
increase in non labor commercial operations of  for the year ended december  was primarily due to the expansion of our foreign operations  which we expanded significantly in the latter half of increase in non labor general and administration of  primarily related to increases in legal costs associated with ongoing litigation and increases in infrastructure costs to support our growth as a commercial entity

the income tax benefit for is attributable to the exchange of state research tax credits for cash 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands  except per share data as of december   our consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled  the  increase from december  is largely attributable to the significantly increased sales and the resulting collection of accounts receivable and proceeds from employee option exercises  offset by payments against our mortgage loan of  payments related to the pdl settlement of  and omrf patent purchase agreement of  and capital expenditures associated with validation and regulatory approval of our smithfield  rhode island facility 
until required for use in the business  we invest our cash reserves in money market funds and high quality commercial  corporate and us government notes in accordance with our investment policy 
financial instruments that potentially expose the company to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash equivalents  corporate bonds  accounts receivable and our foreign exchange derivative contracts 
at december   one individual customer accounted for of the accounts receivable balance 
at december   we have foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling  these outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had a net fair value of  of which an unrealized gain of  is included in other current assets   is included in other assets and an unrealized loss of  is included in other current liabilities 
the counterparty to these forward contracts is a large multinational commercial bank  and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material 
however  we can not be assured that the financial institution will not be further impacted by the negative economic environment 
in january  we amended and restated our existing credit agreement with bank of america  na to  among other things  increase our revolving credit facility by  the amended agreement provides for a  revolving credit facility  with up to a  sublimit for letters of credit that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
with the consent of the lenders and the administrative agent and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  we may increase the facility to  in accordance with its terms 
at december   our working capital was  compared to  at december  at december   our current ratio was  compared to at december  the increase in current ratio relates primarily to increases in our accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents as well as reductions in amounts payable to pdl and omrf 
we anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash should provide us adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  versus  provided by operating activities for the year ended december  the change is primarily due to the increase in pre tax income achieved in versus the same period in the components of cash provided by operating activities  as reported in our statement of cash flows  for the period ended december  are as follows our reported net income  adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  non cash debt exchange expense  unrealized currency gain  unrealized hedge gains  deferred taxes and stock compensation  was  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of  primarily relates to increases in accounts receivable of  offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and a decrease in inventory of  in  we expect changes in cash from operations to be highly dependent on sales levels  and the related cash collections  from soliris 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  versus  used in investing activities for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the net cash used for investing activities consisted of the following additions to property  plant and equipment of  of which  was attributable to expenditures related to our rhode island manufacturing facility  with the remaining attributable to spending on information technology and facility capital costs 
final payments of  and  related to a settlement agreement with pdl biopharma and purchase of patents from oklahoma medical research foundation  or omrf  respectively 
in july  we acquired a manufacturing plant in smithfield  rhode island for the future commercial production of soliris and development and manufacturing of future products 
since this date  we have incurred costs related to the construction of the plant to support full scale commercial manufacturing 
we have also capitalized costs related to validation activities  including engineering runs and inventory production necessary to obtain approval of the facility from government regulators for the production of a commercially approved drug 
in december  we received final regulatory approval for production of commercial quantities of eculizumab by the ec accordingly  our plant is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  and therefore we placed the plant into service 
in the fourth quarter of  the fda commenced its inspection of our rhode island manufacturing facility and requested additional information regarding our manufacturing processes which we expect to address in through december   we have capitalized  related to the facility  which includes all costs associated with construction  renovation and upgrades  engineering runs  pre approval inventory production and capitalized interest 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this amount related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options of  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   this amount was offset by the  prepayment in full of our mortgage loan 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations related to our third party manufacturer  certain other third parties described below  for open letters of credit totaling  and for our  convertible senior notes due february the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years 
these do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements 
these obligations  commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations convertible notes payable interest expense capital and operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments clinical and manufacturing development licenses total commercial commitments the contractual obligations table above does not include contingent royalties and other contingent contractual payments we may owe to third parties in the future because such payments are contingent on future sales of our products and the existence and scope of third party intellectual property rights and other factors described under the risk factors 
the table above also does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal  state and foreign income tax matters of  at december  the timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at december  we do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
convertible notes we have outstanding  principal amount of convertible senior notes due february   or the notes 
we pay interest on these notes on a semi annual basis on february and august of each year 
however  no principal payments are due until february  except under certain circumstances such as liquidation  merger or business combination 
the convertible notes payable do not contain covenants related to our financial performance 
in october  certain holders of the notes exercised conversion rights with respect to an aggregate principal amount of  of the notes resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the shares were issued in november in april and may  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in exchange for  principal amount of our convertible senior notes due owned by certain note holders 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share per principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment  at any time prior to the close of business on the final maturity date of the notes 
we do not have the right to redeem any of the notes prior to maturity 
the conversion rate and conversion price have been adjusted for the stock split effected on august  as of december   the market value of our  principal amount of notes  based on quoted market prices  was estimated at  versus  at december  the decrease of  from december  is largely attributable to the issuance of  shares of our common stock in exchange for  principal amount of the notes in the second quarter of mortgage loan we had a mortgage loan of  to finance the purchase and construction of our manufacturing facility in smithfield  rhode island 
in june  we amended the mortgage loan agreement to permit the prepayment of the loan without penalty 
we prepaid a portion of the mortgage loan each month beginning in july and made a final payment of the remaining principal balance in october revolving credit facility in february  we entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution to provide for an available  revolving credit facility that could be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
the loan was collateralized by substantially all of alexion pharmaceuticals  inc s assets  including the pledge of the equity interests of certain direct subsidiaries  but excluding intellectual property  assets of foreign subsidiaries and assets related to our manufacturing facility in smithfield  rhode island 
the borrowing base was limited to the lesser of  or of eligible domestic receivables 
at december   we had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility and were in compliance with all financial debt covenants 
in january  we amended and restated the credit agreement  the amended credit agreement  to  among other things  increase the revolving credit facility by  the amended credit agreement provides for a  facility  with up to a  sublimit for letters of credit that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
with the consent of the lenders and the administrative agent and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  we may increase the facility to  in accordance with the amended credit agreement

the assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives 
the average interest rates on the above capital leases is and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease 
operating leases our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment 
we currently lease  square feet of space at our headquarters and research and development facility in cheshire  connecticut and approximately  square feet of space at our regional executive and sales offices in lausanne  switzerland 
additionally  we lease research space in san diego  california 
in connection with the closure of alexion antibody technologies in  we accrued the fair value of future payments under the lease see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in september  we entered into a sub lease for the aat facility  which provides for sub lease payments to us through the term of the lease  or we believe that our administrative office space is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future 
we also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facility  together with third party manufacturing facilities  will be adequate for our on going activities 
in addition to the locations above  we also lease offices in certain countries to facilitate our operations as a global organization 
commercial commitments our commercial commitments consist of research and development  license  operational  clinical development  and manufacturing cost commitments  along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses 
the timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs  which may or may not be realized  are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans 
our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with lonza sales ag 
lonza agreement we have a supply agreement with lonza sales ag relating to the manufacture of soliris  which requires payments to lonza at the inception of the contract and as product is manufactured 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our plans for future levels of production by lonza  which depends upon our commercial requirements  the progress of our clinical development programs and the production levels of our smithfield  rhode island manufacturing facility

income taxes at december   we have pre tax federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of  and  respectively 
these nol s expire between and we also have federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
these income tax credits expire between and due to the amount of our nol s and credit carryforwards  we do not anticipate paying substantial us federal income taxes in the foreseeable future 
we do expect to pay cash taxes in various us states and in foreign jurisdictions where we have operations and have utilized all of our net operating losses 
we were again subject to the alternative minimum tax during and expect that we will continue to be subject to cash payments for the alternative minimum tax in the near term 
the payment of an alternative minimum tax amount generates a credit that may be carried forward indefinitely and used to offset our regular income tax liability 
the tax reform act of contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayer s ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of percent over a three year period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands  except per share data interest rate risk as of december   we held all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts and money market funds  which are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
at december   we held  in marketable securities with maturity dates of less than one year 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  we expect to hold time based investments  such as corporate bonds  through maturity 
we estimate that a change of basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately in the fair value of our cash and investments  which had a weighted average duration of approximately months at december  our outstanding long term liabilities as of december  included our  convertible senior notes due february  as the notes bear interest at a fixed rate  our results of operations would not be impacted by interest rate changes 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution to borrow up to  in january  we amended and restated the credit agreement  the amended credit agreement  to  among other things  increase the revolving credit facility to  we may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to i libor plus to depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities as calculated in accordance with the agreement  or ii a base rate equal to the higher of the a prime rate then in effect  b federal funds rate then in effect plus  and c eurodollar rate then in effect plus  plus to depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities as calculated in accordance with the agreement 
we do not expect changes in interest rates related to our revolving credit facility to have a material effect on our financial statements 
foreign exchange market risk as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  japanese yen  swiss franc and british pound 
the current exposures arise primarily from cash  accounts receivable  intercompany receivables and payables  and product sales denominated in foreign currencies 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural  opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses 
we currently have a derivative program in place to achieve two goals limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and hedge a portion of our forecasted product sales  using contracts with duration of up to months  to mitigate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
both programs utilize forward foreign exchange contracts intended to reduce  not eliminate  the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
as of december   we held foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling  as of december   our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had a net fair value of we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
the counterparty to these forward contracts is a multinational commercial bank 
we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material 
since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities  we do not expect that a hypothetical adverse change fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets  which include our monetary assets and liabilities and our forward contracts 
the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales
