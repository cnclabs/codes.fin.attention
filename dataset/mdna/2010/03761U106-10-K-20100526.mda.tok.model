apollo investment commenced operations on april  upon completion of its initial public offering that raised million in net proceeds selling million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
since then  and through march   we have raised approximately billion in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock 
subsequently  in april  the company raised an additional million from an offering of common stock  bringing the total net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock since inception to approximately billion 

table of contents investments our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
as a business development company  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies 
pursuant to rules adopted in  the sec expanded the definition of eligible portfolio company to include certain public companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange 
the sec also adopted an additional rule under the act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company to include companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than million 
this rule became effective on july  revenue we generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the securities we hold and capital gains  if any  on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
our debt investments  whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans  generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  euribor  gbp libor  or the prime rate 
interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually and while us subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of our investments may include zero coupon and or step up bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
in addition  some of our investments provide for pik 
such amounts of accrued payment in kind pik interest or dividends are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer 
we may also generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and  if applicable  consulting fees  etc 
expenses all investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff  when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us  and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by aim

we expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase moderately in dollar terms 
during periods of asset growth  we generally expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines 
incentive fees  interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities  among others  may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance  benchmarks libor and euribor  and offerings of our securities relative to comparative periods  among other factors

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments under procedures established by our board of directors  we value investments  including certain senior secured debt  subordinated debt  and other debt securities with maturities greater than days  for which market quotations are readily available  at such market quotations unless they are deemed not to represent fair value 
we attempt to obtain market quotations from at least two brokers or dealers if available  otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer or other independent pricing service 
we utilize mid market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within the range is more representative 
if and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  we typically utilize independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value 
accordingly  such investments go through our multi step valuation process as described below 
in each case  our independent valuation firms consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such level categorized assets 
investments maturing in days or less are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus amortized premium  which approximates fair value 
investments that are not publicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our investment adviser responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of our investment adviser  independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors conduct independent appraisals and review our investment adviser s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment  the audit committee of the board of directors reviews the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firm and responds to the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the respective independent valuation firm and the audit committee 

table of contents investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach  an income approach  or both approaches  as appropriate 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities including a business 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted 
the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
in following these approaches  the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include  as relevant available current market data  including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and multiples  security covenants  call protection provisions  information rights  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its earnings and discounted cash flows  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public  m a comparables  our principal market as the reporting entity and enterprise values  among other factors 
when readily available  broker quotations and or quotations provided by pricing services are considered in the valuation process of independent valuation firms 
for the fiscal year ended march   there has been no change to the company s valuation techniques and related inputs considered in the valuation process 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance related to fair value measurements 
this guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
we adopted this guidance for our first fiscal quarter ended june  asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by the company at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
in all cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment 
on october   revised guidance was issued which provides examples of how to determine fair value in a market that is not active 
it did not change the fair value measurement principles set forth in asc furthermore  on april   the fasb issued additional revised guidance which provides information on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
it also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
according to this guidance in the above circumstances  more analysis and significant adjustments to transaction or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value 
in addition  it requires disclosure of any changes in valuation techniques and related inputs resulting from the application 
the total effect of the change in valuation techniques and related inputs must also be disclosed by major asset category 
this revised guidance was effective for periods ending after june  the adoption did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
accounting standards update no 
 improving disclosure about fair value measurements was released in january and is effective for periods beginning after december  this update improves financial statement disclosure around transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements  around valuation techniques and inputs and around other related disclosures 
transfers between levels  if any  are recognized at the end of the reporting period 
see certain additional disclosures in note to our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company records interest and dividend income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  on an accrual basis 
some of our loans and other investments  including certain preferred equity investments may have contractual pik interest or dividends 
pik represents contractual interest or dividends accrued and is added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discounts are capitalized and we amortize such amounts into income 
upon the prepayment of a loan  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts 
structuring fees are recorded as other income when earned 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
results of operations results comparisons are for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march  investment income for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   gross investment income totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in gross investment income from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to two factors the reduction in the size of the income producing portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year and the reduction in average libor of over basis points year over year 
the increase in gross investment income from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to changes in the composition of the portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year 
expenses net operating expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   of which million  million and million  respectively  were base management fees and performance based incentive fees and million  million and million  respectively  were interest and other credit facility expenses

the decrease in net expenses from fiscal to was primarily related to the decrease in interest and other credit facility expenses due to the reduction in average libor in the year over year period coupled with the lower average outstanding balance on the credit facility during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in net expenses from fiscal to was primarily related to the increase in performance based incentive expenses accrued during fiscal as compared to those accrued during fiscal in addition  excise tax expense totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march   and

net realized losses for the fiscal year ended march  were million and the net realized gains were million for the fiscal year ended march  net realized losses incurred during fiscal year were primarily related to sales and restructurings of certain underperforming portfolio companies  various portfolio optimization measures  and our liquidity management strategy during the financial crisis early in our fiscal year 
net realized losses incurred in fiscal were mainly derived from selective exits of underperforming investments 
net realized gains for fiscal were mainly derived from exits from certain outperforming investments 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments  cash equivalents and foreign currencies for the fiscal year ended march   net change in unrealized appreciation on the company s investments  cash equivalents  foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled million 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  net change in unrealized depreciation on the company s investments  cash equivalents  foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled million and million  respectively 
net unrealized appreciation for fiscal was primarily due to the recognition of realized losses which reversed unrealized depreciation  net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals  and improving capital market conditions 
during fiscal  a material increase in unrealized depreciation was recognized from significantly lower fair value determinations on many of our investments 
these lower fair values were driven primarily from the general market dislocation  the illiquid capital markets  and the then current market expectations for pricing increased credit risk and default assumptions 
for the fiscal period  unrealized depreciation generally stemmed from lower fair values on certain investments as compared to the prior fiscal year

the junior note generally entitles apollo fdc to the net interest and other proceeds due under the fdc reference obligation after payment of interest due under the senior notes  as described above 
in addition  apollo fdc is entitled to of any realized appreciation in the fdc reference obligation and  since the senior note is a non recourse obligation  apollo fdc is exposed up to the amount of equity used by aic holdco to fund the purchase of the junior note plus any additional margin apollo decides to post  if any  during the term of the financing

the boots reference obligations pay interest at the rate of libor plus per year and mature in june we do not consolidate aic holdco or its wholly owned subsidiaries and accordingly only the value of our investment in aic holdco is included on our statement of assets and liabilities 
the senior note  total return swap and acquisition loan are non recourse to aic holdco  its subsidiaries and us and have standard events of 
table of contents default including failure to pay contractual amounts when due and failure by each of the underlying apollo special purpose entities to provide additional credit support  sell assets or prepay a portion of its obligations if the value of the fdc reference obligation  the txu reference obligation or the boots reference obligation  as applicable  declines below specified levels

dividends dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal years ended march   and totaled million or per share  million or per share  and million or per share  respectively 
tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on form after the end of the calendar year 
our quarterly dividends  if any  will be determined by our board of directors 
the following table summarizes our quarterly dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively declared dividends fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
to maintain our ric status  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company  we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions 
also  our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax 
table of contents consequences  including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company 
in addition  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term  or the accrual of original issue or market discount 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company 
with respect to the dividends to stockholders  income from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly  distributed to stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended march   many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans are usually based on floating libor and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
as the percentage of our us mezzanine and other subordinated loans increase as a percentage of our total investments  we expect that more of the loans in our portfolio will have fixed rates 
at march   our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities were closely matched 
as such  a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our net investment income 
however  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time to time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the fiscal year ended march   we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
