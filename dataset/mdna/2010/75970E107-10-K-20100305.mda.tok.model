item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the heading risk management credit risk and allowance for loan losses 
we have omitted a discussion of lease financing  as such financing comprised only approximately of our portfolio at december  commercial  financial and agricultural loans 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans referred to as commercial loans  which accounted for approximately of our total loans at december   are customarily granted to established local business customers in our market area on a fully collateralized basis to meet their credit needs 
many of these loans have terms allowing the loan to be extended for periods of between one and five years 
loans are usually structured either to fully amortize over the term of the loan or to balloon after the third year or fifth year of the loan  typically with an amortization period not to exceed years 
the terms and loan structure are dependent on the collateral and strength of the borrower 
the loan to value ratios range from to  depending on the type of collateral 
commercial lending generally involves different risks from those associated with commercial real estate lending or construction lending 
although commercial loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets  the repayment of these types of loans depends primarily on the creditworthiness and projected cash flow of the borrower and any guarantors 
thus  the general business conditions of the local economy and the local business borrower s ability to sell its products and services  thereby generating sufficient operating revenue to repay us under the agreed upon terms and conditions  are the chief considerations when assessing the risk of a commercial loan 
the liquidation of collateral is considered a secondary source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may  among other things  be obsolete or of limited use 
to manage these risks  the bank s policy is to secure its commercial loans with both the assets of the borrowing business and any other additional collateral and guarantees that may be available 
in addition  we actively monitor certain financial measures of the borrower  including advance rate  cash flow  collateral value and other appropriate credit factors 
we use commercial loan credit scoring models for smaller level commercial loans

index to financial statements real estate construction 
our real estate construction loans construction loans represented approximately of our total loans at december  our construction loan portfolio consists of loans for the construction of single family residential properties  multi family properties and commercial projects 
maturities for construction loans generally range from to months for residential property and from to months for non residential and multi family properties 
construction lending entails significant additional risks compared to residential real estate or commercial real estate lending 
a significant additional risk is that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the property under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction 
thus  it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and to calculate related loan to value ratios 
to minimize the risks associated with construction lending  we limit loan to value ratios to of when completed appraised values for owner occupied and investor owned residential or commercial properties 
real estate family mortgage 
we are active in the real estate family mortgage area referred to as residential real estate loans  with approximately of our total loans at december  being residential real estate loans 
we offer both first and second mortgages on residential real estate 
loans secured by residential real estate in which the property is the principal residence of the borrower are referred to as primary family mortgages 
loans secured by residential real estate in which the property is rented to tenants or is not the principal residence of the borrower are referred to as rental investment family mortgages 
we also  offer loans for the preparation of residential real property prior to construction referred to in this annual report as residential land development loans 
in addition  we offer home equity lines of credit and term loans secured by first and second mortgages on the residences of borrowers for purchases  refinances  home improvements  education and other personal expenditures 
both fixed and variable rate loans are offered with competitive terms and fees 
originations of residential real estate loans are generated through either retail efforts in our branches or wholesale marketing  which involves obtaining mortgage referrals from third party mortgage brokers 
we attempt to minimize the risk associated with residential real estate loans by strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower  typically  we also limit the maximum loan to value ratio 
we retain loans for our portfolio when the bank has sufficient liquidity to fund the needs of established customers and when rates are favorable to retain the loans 
we also originate residential real estate loans with the intention of selling them in the secondary market to third party private investors 
these loans are collateralized by one to four family residential real estate and are sold with servicing rights released 
residential real estate originations to be sold are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors  and we are obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded 
the risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market 
the company does not actively market or originate subprime mortgage loans 
we also offer home equity loans or lines of credit as an option to borrowers who elect to utilize the accumulated equity in their homes by borrowing money through either a first or second lien home equity loan or line of credit 
we limit our exposure to second lien home equity loans or lines of credit  which inherently carry a higher risk of loss upon default  by limiting these types of loans to borrowers with high credit scores 
real estate commercial mortgage 
our real estate commercial mortgage loans commercial real estate loans represented approximately of our total loans at december  we offer loans in which the owner develops a property with the intention of locating its business there 
these loans are referred to as owner occupied commercial real estate 
because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful development  operation and management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy as a whole  in addition to the borrower s ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to repay us 
if our estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  we may not be able to obtain full repayment on the loan in the event of default and foreclosure 
in most instances  these loans are secured by the underlying real estate of the business and other non real estate collateral  such as equipment or other assets used in the course of business 
in addition  we offer loans in which the owner develops a property where the source of repayment of the loan will come from the sale or lease of the developed property  for example  retail shopping centers  hotels  storage facilities  nursing homes  etc 
these loans are referred to as non owner occupied commercial real estate 
we also offer commercial real estate loans to developers of commercial properties for purposes of site acquisition and preparation and other development prior to actual construction referred to in this annual report as commercial land development loans 
we seek to minimize risks by limiting the maximum loan to value ratio and strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower  the quality of the collateral and the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements management of the property securing the loan 
we also actively monitor such financial measures as advance rate  cash flow  collateral value and other appropriate credit factors 
we generally obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties to the transaction based on a review of the guarantor s financial statements 
installment loans to individuals 
installment loans to individuals or consumer loans  which represented approximately of our total loans at december   are granted to individuals for the purchase of personal goods 
these loans are generally granted for periods ranging between one and six years at fixed rates of interest to above the prime interest rate quoted in the wall street journal 
loss or decline of income by the borrower due to unplanned occurrences may represent risk of default to us 
in the event of default  a shortfall in the value of the collateral may pose a loss to us in this loan category 
before granting a consumer loan  we assess the applicant s credit history and ability to meet existing and proposed debt obligations 
although the applicant s creditworthiness is the primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral  if any  to the proposed loan amount 
we obtain a lien against the collateral securing the loan and hold title until the loan is repaid in full 
deposit services 
we offer a broad range of deposit services and products to our consumer and commercial clients 
through our community branch networks  we offer totally free consumer checking accounts with free internet banking with bill pay and free debit cards  interest bearing checking  money market accounts and savings accounts 
in addition  renasant offers certificates of deposit  individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts 
for our commercial clients  we offer a competitive suite of cash management products which include  but are not limited to  remote deposit capture  cd rom statements with account reconciliation  electronic statements  positive pay  ach origination and wire transfer  wholesale and retail lockbox  investment sweep accounts  enhanced business internet banking  outbound data exchange  multi bank reporting and international services 
the deposit services we offer accounted for approximately  and of our total gross revenues in  and  respectively  in the form of fees for deposit services 
no material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single or small group of customers  and the loss of any single customer s deposits or a small group of customers deposits would not have a materially adverse effect on our business 
the deposits held by our bank have been primarily generated within the market areas where the branches are located 
neither we nor the bank have any foreign activities 
other products and services 
through the financial services division of the bank  we also offer a wide variety of fiduciary services and administer as trustee or in other fiduciary or representative capacities qualified retirement plans  profit sharing and other employee benefit plans  personal trusts and estates 
in addition  the financial services division offers annuities  mutual funds and other investment services through a third party broker dealer 
the financial services division does not constitute a separately reportable segment for financial reporting purposes 
operations of renasant insurance renasant insurance is a full service insurance agency offering all lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers 
at december   renasant insurance contributed total revenue of million  or  of the company s total gross revenues  and operated three offices in central and northern mississippi 
competition banking vigorous competition exists in all major product and geographic areas in which we conduct banking business 
we compete through our bank for available loans and deposits with state  regional and national banks in all of our service areas  as well as savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  brokerage firms and investment companies 
all of these numerous institutions compete in the delivery of services and products through availability  quality and pricing  and many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do  including higher total assets and capitalization  greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services 
for  we maintained approximately of the market share deposit base in our entire mississippi area  approximately in our entire tennessee area and approximately in our entire alabama area 
certain markets in which we operate have demographics which we believe indicate the possibility of future growth at higher rates than other markets in which we operate 
at december   of our loans and of our deposits were located in these key markets 
we have identified these markets  which are listed in the table below  as our key growth markets

through our insurance subsidiary  we compete with independent insurance agencies and agencies affiliated with other banks and or other insurance carriers 
all of these agencies compete in the delivery of personal and commercial product lines 
there is no dominant insurance agency in our markets 
supervision and regulation banking under the current regulatory environment  nearly every facet of our banking operations is regulated pursuant to various state and federal banking laws  rules and regulations 
the primary focus of these laws and regulations is the protection of depositors and the maintenance of the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole and the insurance funds of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
while the following summary addresses the regulatory environment in which we operate  it is not intended to be a fully inclusive discussion of the statutes and regulations affecting our operations 
discussions in this section focus only on certain provisions of such statutes and regulations and do not purport to be comprehensive 
such discussions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the relevant statutes and regulations 
in addition  the impact from future changes in federal or state legislation on our operations cannot be predicted 
in the wake of the economic downturn currently affecting the united states  many significant changes to federal and state laws affecting us have been proposed 
we elected not to participate in the us treasury department s capital purchase program  which is part of the federal government s troubled asset relief program 
thus  we will not be subject to any of the regulations enacted and to be enacted with respect to such program 
we have  however  opted to participate in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the regulations we are subject to on account of our participation in this program currently do not have a material effect on our business or operations  but we are unable to predict what additional regulations  if any  we may be subject to in connection with our participation in this program and the impact of any such regulations on our business and operations 
we are a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the act  and are registered as such with the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
we are required to file with the federal reserve an annual report and such other information as the federal reserve may require 
the federal reserve may also make examinations of us and the bank pursuant to the act 
the federal reserve has the authority which to date it has not exercised to regulate provisions of certain types of our debt 
the act requires a bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority owned 
table of contents 
index to financial statements by such bank holding company 
the act further provides that the federal reserve shall not approve any acquisition  merger or consolidation which would result in a monopoly or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking 
the federal reserve will also not approve any transaction in which the effect of the transaction might be to substantially lessen competition or in any manner amount to a restraint on trade  unless the anti competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the benefits to the public interest resulting from the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
the act also prohibits a bank holding company  with certain exceptions  from itself engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in non banking activities 
the principal exception to this prohibition is for a bank holding company engaging in or acquiring shares of a company whose activities are found by the federal reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
in making determinations whether activities are closely related to banking or managing banks  the federal reserve is required to consider whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company or its subsidiaries can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public  such as greater convenience  increased competition or gains in efficiency of resources and whether such public benefits outweigh the risks of possible adverse effects  such as decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices 
the company and the bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act and the federal deposit insurance act on any extensions of credit to the company or the bank  on investments in the stock or other securities of the company or the bank and on taking such stock or other securities as collateral for loans of any borrower 
on november   the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of the financial services modernization act was signed into law 
the financial services modernization act eliminates the barriers erected by the glass steagall act and amends the act  among other statutes 
further  it allows for the affiliation of banking  securities and insurance activities in new financial services organizations 
a dominant theme of the financial services modernization act is functional regulation of financial services  with the primary regulator of the company or its subsidiaries being the agency which traditionally regulates the activity in which the company or its subsidiaries wish to engage 
for example  the securities and exchange commission sec will regulate bank holding company securities transactions  and the various banking regulators will oversee banking activities 
the principal provisions of the financial services modernization act permit the company  so long as it meets the standards for a well managed and well capitalized institution and has at least a satisfactory community reinvestment act performance rating  to engage in any activity that is financial in nature  including security and insurance underwriting  investment banking and merchant banking investing in commercial and industrial companies 
the company  if it satisfies the above criteria  can file a declaration of its status as a financial holding company fhc with the federal reserve and thereafter engage directly or through nonbank subsidiaries in the expanded range of activities which the financial services modernization act identifies as financial in nature 
further  the company  if it elects fhc status  will be able to pursue additional activities which are incidental or complementary in nature to a financial activity or which the federal reserve subsequently determines to be financial in nature 
we have not elected to become an fhc 
under the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate act  the company or any other bank holding company located in mississippi is able to acquire a bank located in any other state  and a bank holding company located outside mississippi can acquire any mississippi based bank  in either case subject to certain deposit percentage and other restrictions 
the interstate act also provides that  unless an individual state has elected to prohibit out of state banks from operating interstate branches within its territory  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies may consolidate their multistate bank operations into a single bank subsidiary and branch interstate through acquisitions 
under mississippi law  out of state bank holding companies may establish a bank in mississippi only by acquiring a mississippi bank or mississippi bank holding company 
bank holding companies are allowed to acquire savings associations under the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of firrea 
deposit insurance premiums for banks and savings associations were increased as a result of firrea  and losses incurred by the fdic in connection with the default or assistance of troubled federally insured financial institutions are required to be reimbursed by other federally insured financial institutions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is substantially dependent on the ability of renasant bank to transfer funds to the company in the form of dividends  loans and advances 
under mississippi law  a mississippi bank may not pay dividends unless its earned surplus is in excess of three times capital stock 
a mississippi bank with earned surplus in excess of three times capital stock may pay a dividend  subject to the approval of the mississippi department of banking and consumer finance 
in addition  the fdic must approve any payment of dividends by the bank 
accordingly  the approval of these supervisory authorities is required prior to renasant bank paying dividends to the company 
federal reserve regulations also limit the amount renasant bank may loan to the company unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations 
the bank s deposits are insured by the fdic  and the bank is subject to examination and review by that regulatory authority 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia provides for increased funding for the fdic s deposit insurance fund through risk based assessments and expands the regulatory powers of federal banking agencies to permit prompt corrective actions to resolve problems of insured depository institutions 
the community reinvestment act of requires the assessment by the appropriate regulatory authority of a financial institution s record in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
the usa patriot act of contains the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the imlafa 
the imlafa substantially broadens existing anti money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states  imposes new compliance and due diligence obligations  creates new crimes and penalties  compels the production of documents located both inside and outside the united states  including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the united states and clarifies the safe harbor from civil liability to customers 
the us treasury department has issued a number of regulations implementing the usa patriot act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as our bank 
the regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 
the imlafa requires all financial institutions  as defined  to establish anti money laundering compliance and due diligence programs 
such programs must include  among other things  adequate policies  the designation of a compliance officer  employee training programs and an independent audit function to review and test the program 
the company believes that it has complied with these requirements 
insurance renasant insurance is subject to licensing requirements and regulation under the laws of the united states and the state of mississippi 
the laws and regulations are primarily for the benefit of clients 
in all jurisdictions  the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment by regulatory authorities 
generally  such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant  renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations 
licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons  including the violation of such regulations  conviction of crimes and the like 
possible sanctions which may be imposed for violation of regulations include suspension of individual employees  limitations on engaging in a particular business for a specified period of time  revocation of licenses  censures and fines 
monetary policy and economic controls we and the bank are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve 
an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to stabilize prices 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying degrees to influence overall growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past  especially in connection with the economic downturn currently affecting the united states  and are expected to do so in the future 
in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the various money markets  as well as the effect of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities including the federal reserve  the effect on our  and the bank s  future business and earnings cannot be predicted with accuracy
