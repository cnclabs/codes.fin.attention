includes million and million of non current available for sale securities as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for additional overview information relating to our business  including actimmune  co promotion and our product development programs  please see the discussion in item business overview 
significant license acquisition agreements we are highly dependent on technology we license or acquire from third parties 
actimmune  which is currently our sole marketed product  is subject to a license agreement with genentech  inc the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under item business license and other agreements  notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and under the heading results of operations below 
we paid million in march in connection with our decision to proceed with regulatory approval for pirfenidone and an additional million in connection with our clinical progress of rg we may be required to make future contingent milestone payments to the owners of our licensed products or the suppliers of our drug compounds in accordance with our license  commercialization and collaboration agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the remaining milestones per the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
of the remaining million in aggregate milestone payments  million in remaining contingent payments would be made by us only if positive phase iii data and registration in the united states and european union are achieved for pirfenidone 
potential future milestone payments of million are related to the further development of actimmune  which we have no current plan to do  and therefore we do not expect to pay these amounts 
our need for additional capital we commenced operations in and have incurred significant losses to date 
our revenue has been limited primarily to sales of actimmune  which has been declining in recent years  derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over the next several years as we continue the development of our advanced stage pulmonology pipeline and our research stage hepatology pipeline  apply for regulatory approvals for pirfenidone and grow our operations 
although we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from sales of actimmune and the proceeds from our january public offering  described below  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  settlement with the government  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of  we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize pirfenidone 
as a result  we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
if additional capital is not available  we may be forced to curtail our development activities or cease operations 
discontinuation of actimmune trial for ipf effective march   we made the decision to discontinue the phase iii inspire clinical trial evaluating actimmune in patients with ipf based upon the recommendation of the study s independent dmc 
as a result of the disappointing inspire trial results  we revised our estimates of inventory requirements as of december  accordingly  we recorded a charge of million in related to the prepayment of inventory that we had expected to receive in and we also recorded inventory write downs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while we believe our actimmune 
table of contents finished goods inventory at december  is recoverable for at least its million net carrying value  if sales decline below our revised estimates  we may incur additional inventory write downs in excess as well as product returns 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
convertible debt on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board  accounting standards codification asc topic asc  formerly fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
asc requires the issuer of convertible debt that may be settled in shares or cash upon conversion at their option  such as our million convertible senior notes due march that are outstanding as of december   to account for their liability and equity components separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument  classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt 
the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar bond without the conversion feature 
this required management to make estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates as of the date of original issuance  in addition to estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates as of our june debt extinguishment and the debt exchanges 
stock based compensation beginning january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  previously referred to as statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to estimate the value of share based awards  we use the black scholes model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from any of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
if all of the remaining and outstanding restricted stock awards that were granted in  and became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted 
table of contents average remaining period of year 
if all of the remaining nonvested and outstanding stock option awards that have been granted became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
however  no compensation expense will be recognized for any stock awards that do not vest 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and final delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collectibility of the amounts receivable from the customer 
therefore  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery when title passes to a credit worthy customer 
reserves are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts  if applicable 
we sell to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
we are obligated to accept returns from customers if the pharmaceuticals they purchased have reached the expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on historical experience 
due to the nature of our business model and based on historical experience  these estimates are not highly subjective 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
for each of the periods presented below  we have not made any shipments as a result of incentives and or in excess of our customers ordinary course of business inventory levels 
specialty wholesalers maintain low inventory levels and manage their inventory levels to optimize patient based need demand and generally do not overstock actimmune 
the tables below present the amounts reported as revenue reductions for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentages year ended december  reductions to revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total year ended december  gross product revenue revenue reductions as a of gross product revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total in  chargebacks were approximately of gross revenue  but historically have fallen within a range of to in any given year depending on the customer base 
the increase in the past two years above this range is primarily attributed to the tricare pharmacy program tricare which became effective january and is administered by the department of defense 
excluding tricare  chargebacks would have been approximately  which would have increased reported revenue by approximately million 
in  medicaid rebates were approximately of gross revenue  but historically have fallen within a range of 
table of contents to in any given year 
if medicaid rebates had decreased to during  this would have increased our reported revenue by approximately million 
the ranges noted above are based on a review of historical trends  though we believe the trend for the ranges in future periods will be slightly higher given the recent price increases described below 
chargebacks as a percentage of gross revenue have increased year over year for the past two years due to disappointing clinical trial results and our subsequent decision to discontinue further development of actimmune in addition to the new tricare program 
the increase in medicaid rebate revenue reductions from in and in to in is due to price increases for actimmune implemented midway through and and the lack of a corresponding increase in the medicaid reimbursement rate 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing chargebacks is from the federal supply schedule  veterans administration and public health system pricing documents 
these documents establish the maximum price allowable for the sale of our product to a government customer 
the chargeback amount per unit is computed as the difference between our sales price to the wholesaler and the selling price from the wholesaler to a government customer 
chargebacks are processed directly by the wholesalers and are deducted from payments to us 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing medicaid rebates is from each of the states 
medicaid rebates are billed directly to us from each state 
billings from each of the states  which are based on end user reports submitted by pharmacies to the state agencies  are typically received within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we use historical billing and payment trends made to the states to assist us in determining an estimated medicaid rebate amount each period 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may overestimate or underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in the event we underestimate  we could be required to record significant additional research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
to date  we have not experienced changes in estimates that have led to material research and development expense adjustments being recorded in subsequent periods 
inventory reserves our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and our inventory costs are determined using the first in first out method 
we enter into purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the long lead times required to manufacture our products 
we write off the cost of inventory and reserve for future minimum purchase commitments  if any  that we consider to be in excess of forecasted future demand 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will expire before it can be sold  based on future sales forecasts 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory purchase levels 
we are also required to monitor the expiration dates of our products  since our products can no longer be used after their respective expiration dates 
in  in an effort to best manage the procurement and distribution levels of actimmune  we successfully completed the necessary testing to extend the expiration period of actimmune from months to a total of months 
as part of our excess inventory assessment for actimmune  we also estimate the expiration date of any actimmune to be manufactured in the future 

table of contents projected revenue trends resulted in us recording charges during  and of million  million and million  respectively  to cost of goods sold for excess inventories 
if actimmune revenue levels experienced in future periods are substantially below our current expectations  we could be required to record additional charges for excess inventories 
please refer to the statements under item a 
risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results could differ from our estimates 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenue for the year ended december   we recorded total net revenue of million  compared to million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
we reported a slight increase in compared with because we received a million milestone payment from roche in  our collaboration partner  compared with a milestone payment in this increase offset the year over year decrease we reported in actimmune product sales of million 
the decrease from to was attributable to a decrease in sales of actimmune of approximately million  or  partially offset by an increase in collaboration revenue of million resulting from the agreement with roche 
in early march  we announced that our phase iii inspire program for actimmune in ipf had been discontinued and that future actimmune revenue was expected to decline 
the million  million and million of collaboration revenue for  and  respectively  includes million  million and million of milestones received in september  september and june  respectively  each of which had been assessed as substantive and at risk at the initiation of the agreement and were therefore recognized as revenue when the milestones were achieved  as defined in the related collaboration agreement 
for each of the years ended december   and  actimmune accounted for all of our product revenue 
a majority of these sales were derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
collaboration revenue for each of the three years also includes approximately million of amortization of the million upfront payments received from roche in and january there are a number of variables that impact actimmune revenue including  but not limited to  the discontinuation of the phase iii inspire clinical trial in march  the level of enrollment in ipf clinical trials of other companies  new patients started on therapy  average duration of therapy  new data on actimmune or other products presented at medical conferences and publications in medical journals  reimbursement and patient referrals from physicians 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold included product manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our product revenue and inventory writedowns 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of total product revenue  compared to million and million  or approximately and of total product revenue  in and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of goods sold for each year over year period primarily reflects the decline in actimmune revenue 
included in  and cost of goods sold are charges of million  million and million  respectively recorded for excess inventories 
excluding the million  million and million charges for excess inventory and purchase commitments in  and  respectively  cost of goods sold was approximately  and of product revenue for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from can be attributed to a higher average cost per vial  reflecting the impact of the new supply agreement with bi entered into in june which stipulated a higher cost per vial charged to us 
exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases may affect cost of goods sold on actimmune inventory purchased from bi 
in the past  we have utilized forward exchange contracts to partially offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  but we did not enter into any new contracts in  or 
table of contents research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing decreases of and from to and from to  respectively 
the decrease in compared with is primarily attributed to completion of the capacity clinical trials in early  partially offset by increased expenses associated with the recap extension study  the phase b study of rg in patients chronically infected with hcv and the preparation of the nda and maa for pirfenidone 
the modest decrease in compared with was primarily due to the discontinuation of the inspire program  partially offset by the full enrollment in and completion of our two phase iii capacity studies for pirfenidone late in and the conduct of the phase a and b studies of rg the following table lists our current product development programs and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each program during the indicated periods 
the category titled programs non specific is comprised of facilities and personnel costs that are not allocated to a specific development program or discontinued programs and million  million and million of stock based compensation in  and  respectively 
our management reviews each of these program categories in evaluating our business 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see the specific sections under item a 
risk factors above 
year ended december  development program in thousands pulmonology hepatology programs non specific total the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investments in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  the submission of an ind with the fda to conduct human clinical trials for drugs  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and the submission by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of an nda or bla for a drug product to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in light of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 

table of contents acquired research and development and milestone expense in  we made milestone payments of approximately million in the aggregate 
approximately million in milestone payments were made in connection with the initiation of the phase b study of rg in patients chronically infected with hcv 
a million milestone payment was made in accordance with the pirfenidone purchase agreement entered into in november as described below and our decision in february to submit nda and maa filings for pirfenidone 
in  we licensed from marnac and its co licensor  kdl  their worldwide rights  excluding japan  korea and taiwan  to develop and commercialize pirfenidone for all fibrotic diseases  including renal  liver and pulmonary fibrosis 
effective november   we entered into asset purchase agreements with marnac and kdl whereby we effectively terminated the prior license agreement by purchasing  among other things  the pirfenidone related assets covered by such prior license agreement 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreements  we made acquisition payments of approximately million in contingent acquisition payments of up to an additional million would be made by us only if positive phase iii data and registration in the united states and european union are achieved 
there were no charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments in the year ended december  under this  or any other  agreement 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  year over year increases of and 
headcount and cost reductions related to the closure of the inspire trial for actimmune in march were partially offset by increased legal expenses in connection with the lawsuits filed against the company earlier in and preparation costs related to the potential commercialization of pirfenidone 
g a costs continued to increase into because of the preparation costs related to the potential commercialization of pirfenidone 
restructuring charges in connection with the completion and announcement of our capacity trials  we announced a reduction in force in february we have incurred approximately million of restructuring charges during consisting primarily of severance payments to terminated employees 
there were no restructuring charges in effective march   we made the decision to discontinue the phase iii inspire clinical trial evaluating actimmune in patients with ipf based upon the recommendation of the study s independent data monitoring committee 
as a result of the disappointing inspire trial results  we made the decision to reduce our workforce by approximately  which was completed as of september  as a result  we incurred approximately million in personnel related restructuring charges during the million charge is comprised of approximately million for cash severance and related benefits and million of costs for the acceleration of options for approximately  shares of our common stock 
we also incurred approximately million in expenses in connection with the termination of our previous supply agreement with bi in the second quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
loss on extinguishment of debt in april  we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our convertible notes to issue  in the aggregate  approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for  in the aggregate  million principal amount of the convertible notes  representing approximately of the aggregate principal outstanding of our notes at the date of the exchanges 

table of contents in september  we entered into an exchange agreement with certain holders of our convertible notes to issue approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for approximately million principal amount of the convertible notes  representing approximately of the aggregate principal outstanding of our notes at the date of the exchange 
all of the convertible notes we acquired pursuant to the exchange agreements in april and september were retired upon the closing of the exchanges 
additionally  in september  we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our convertible notes to issue approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for approximately million principal amount of the convertible notes  representing approximately of the aggregate principal outstanding of our notes at the date of the agreements 
all of the convertible notes we acquired pursuant to the exchange agreements in september were retired upon the closing of the exchanges in october upon completion of ten trading days of our common stock necessary to determine the final number of shares to be issued 
the exchange agreements were treated as induced conversions as the holders received a greater number of shares of common stock than would have been issued under the original conversion terms of the convertible notes 
at the time of the exchange agreements  none of the conversion contingencies were met 
under the original terms of the convertible notes  the amount payable on conversion was to be paid in cash  and the remaining conversion obligation stock price in excess of conversion price was payable in cash or shares  at our option 
under the terms of the exchange agreements  all of the settlement was paid in shares 
the difference in the value of the shares of common stock sold under the exchange agreements and the value of the shares used to derive the amount payable under the original conversion agreements resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million in the aggregate the inducement loss 
as required by asc  upon derecognition of the notes  we remeasured the fair value of the liability and equity components using a borrowing rate for similar non convertible debt that would be applicable to us at the date of the exchange agreements 
because borrowing rates increased  the remeasurement of the components of the convertible notes resulted in a gain on extinguishment of approximately million the revaluation gain 
as a result  we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million during the year ended december   calculated as the inducement loss  plus an allocation of advisory fees of approximately million  less the revaluation gain 
on june   we issued million in notes to certain holders of our existing notes in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of their notes 
remaining debt issuance costs of approximately million  related to the extinguishment of million of the existing notes  were expensed during the second quarter of and have been included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations 
the following table reconciles loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  as previously reported with current year reported results in thousands year ended december  loss on extinguishment of debt  as previously reported adjustments and reclassification adjustments  net in connection with adoption of asc reclassification from interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt  as reported herein 
table of contents interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  these decreases in interest income reflect lower average balances on our invested cash and securities throughout compared to and and significantly lower average interest rates in compared to and interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
each period reflects interest expense recorded in connection with our liability under the government settlement reached in october interest expense for also includes interest on our then outstanding million notes  including the amortization of related debt issuance costs 
on june   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our notes to certain holders of our existing notes in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of their notes 
at various dates in  we retired approximately million in principal value of our notes in exchange for common stock  thus reducing a portion of our debt discount amortization as further described below 
on january   we adopted guidance in asc as a result  we have recorded additional interest expense of million in the year ended december   representing amortization of the debt discount established with our adoption of this guidance 
the adoption requires retrospective application  therefore  our previously reported interest expense for the years ended december  and has been restated to reflect additional interest expense of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to reflects our declining obligation under our government settlement  the decline in debt discount amortization as a result of the debt conversions described above  as well as the june issuance of the notes in exchange for the notes 
the notes may not be settled in cash upon conversion at the option of the issuer and thus do not fall under the requirements of this guidance  thereby removing the debt discount that would have been recorded had the notes not been exchanged 
the following table reconciles interest expense for the years ended december  and as previously reported with current year reported results in thousands years ended december interest expense  as previously reported adjustments and reclassification amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs in connection with adoption of asc reclassification to loss on extinguishment of debt interest expense  as reported herein other income expense other income expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million of other expense for the year ended december  and million of other income for other income in consists primarily of realized gains of approximately million from the sale of our shares of targanta common stock 
other expense for is comprised primarily of a million impairment charge for the writedown of our long term available for sale securities  partially offset by a million contingent payment in connection with our divestiture of amphotec in may other income for includes million in aggregate milestone payments from targanta and three rivers in connection with our divestitures of oritavancin and amphotec  respectively 

table of contents provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from other non operating losses  we recorded no provision for income taxes for the year ended december  the million tax benefit recorded in primarily relates to net operating losses that we concluded are realizable based on our estimate of future taxable income resulting from future potential sales of our shares of targanta common stock 
the targanta shares were sold in and  as such  the tax benefit reported in was reversed in and is reflected as a tax provision in that year 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will begin to expire in the year and federal orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately million that will begin to expire in the year in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million that begin to expire in and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
we adopted the provisions of asc topic no 
 previously referred to as fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on january  implementation of asc topic no 
did not result in any adjustment to our consolidated statements of operations or a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit 
income from discontinued operations the income from discontinued operations reflects the divestiture of our infergen product line to valeant which was completed in december the income from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  compares to income of million for the year ended december  discontinued operations in is comprised of adjustments to our initial product return estimates 
income from discontinued operations in reflects a clinical related milestone received from valeant 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of operating losses and payments to the us department of justice in the aggregate of approximately million during  partially offset by the receipt of million in net proceeds from our public offering completed in february and million from our collaboration partner roche 
some of these available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our core operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
in addition  at any point in time we maintain balances that exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis  these cash balances could be impacted and we may be unable to access our cash if the underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date we have not experienced a lack of access to cash in any of our third party financial institution accounts 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure by imposing concentration limits and credit worthiness requirements for all 
table of contents corporate issuers 
at december   we held approximately million of student loan auction rate securities par value of million  classified as long term assets  which are substantially backed by the federal government 
beginning in february  auctions failed for our entire portfolio of auction rate securities and have continued to fail since 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the writedown of the carrying value of these securities as we believed the decline in market value was other than temporary in nature given the deteriorating credit and financial markets and specifically the auction rate securities market 
all of our auction rate securities are currently rated aaa  the highest rating by a rating agency  though a separate rating agency has downgraded two of our securities which we have considered in determining the fair value as of december  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record further impairment charges on these investments 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  including proceeds from our january public offering  and the results from our capacity trials  we currently anticipate the need to liquidate these investments prior to maturity or estimated time to recovery in order to execute our current business plans 
these investments were recorded at fair value as of december  based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
during  several of our auction rate securities with an aggregate fair value of million have been redeemed at or near par value 
due to cash constraints or for strategic business reasons we may decide to take certain actions that reduce our expenses 
for example  based on our current anticipated timelines  during certain periods  one of which is in  we will have the right under our collaboration agreement with roche to opt out of the participation in the future development expenses of rg if we elected to exercise this opt out right  we would no longer be obligated to pay of the development expenses related to rg and roche would thereafter be responsible for paying of such development expenses  in lieu of receiving of any profits in the united states to which we would otherwise have been entitled  we would receive royalty payments in the form of a percentage of net sales of rg in the united states in the range of the high teens to low twenties percent  and we would receive larger milestones in connection with the filing and approval of our nda in the united states 
in addition  we would receive higher royalties on net sales of rg in the rest of the world  and we would retain our current rights to receive all other milestones and our exclusivity rights would remain unchanged 
thus  if we decide to exercise our opt out rights due to cash constraints  we would incur less expense but our rights to share profits from sales in the united states would be terminated and as a result our business and future financial results could be adversely effected 
operating activities cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december   comprised primarily of a net loss of million 
significant changes in working capital consisted of decreases in other accrued liabilities  accounts payable and our liability under the government settlement of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during  we made payments to the department of justice in the aggregate amount of approximately million  including million in accelerated payments 
the declines in accounts payable can be attributed to the million in aggregate payments we made to roche under our collaboration agreement with them  which reduced our liability to them from million at december  down to million at december  the decline in other accrued liabilities reflects the decline in accrued clinical trial costs of approximately million as a result of the completion of the capacity trials early in other working capital changes included increases to inventories of approximately million 
details concerning the loss from operations can be found above in this report under the heading results of operations 
investing activities investing activities provided million in cash flows during the year ended december   primarily due to investment maturities and sales of available for sale securities totaling million  partially offset by investment purchases of million 

table of contents financing activities cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was due to the receipt of million in net proceeds from our public offering completed in february and the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock plans 
we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from sales of actimmune and proceeds from our january public offering  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  settlement with the government  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of however  this forward looking statement involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
this forward looking statement is also based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to sales of actimmune or any of our product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  our ability to partner our programs or products  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  the timing and size of the payments we may receive from roche pursuant to the collaboration agreement  and whether we must repay the principal in connection with our convertible debt obligations 
as a result  we may require additional funds beyond the proceeds received from our january public offering and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no further commitments for such fund raising activities at this time 
additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we have no commercial commitments or loans with related parties 

table of contents contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities  such as milestone payments  for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions contractual obligations total after long term debt obligations government settlement operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations other research and development commitments total contractual cash obligations these amounts include accrued interest and principal amounts of both the convertible senior notes due and the convertible senior notes due the full amount was subsequently paid in february see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these amounts consist of clinical related obligations 
these amounts consist of clinical  process development and other related obligations and are cancelable upon discontinuation of the trial 
they do not include any amounts related to the collaboration agreement with roche given the inherent difficulties in the estimation process 
the operating leases for our facilities require letters of credit secured by a restricted cash balance with our bank 
the amount of each letter of credit approximates six to twelve months of operating rent payable to the landlord of each facility 
change in method of accounting for convertible debt adoption of accounting standards codification topic on january   we adopted asc  formerly fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
asc requires the issuer of convertible debt that may be settled in shares or cash upon conversion at their option  such as our convertible senior notes due march the notes that are currently outstanding  to account for their liability and equity components separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument  classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt 
the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar bond without the conversion feature 
although asc has no impact on our actual past or future cash flows  it requires us to record non cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized 
the adoption requires retrospective application  therefore  our previously reported financial statements for each of the two years in the period ended december   have been adjusted to reflect additional interest expense of million or per share  and million or per share  respectively 
the retrospective adoption of asc decreased the debt issuance costs included in other assets by an aggregate of million  decreased convertible senior notes included in long term liabilities by million and decreased total stockholders deficit by million after a charge of million to accumulated deficit on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition  if our convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity  any unamortized debt discount would result in a loss on extinguishment 
the remaining balance of the unamortized debt discount at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
it updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc  which originated primarily from the guidance in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
asu will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
we are currently assessing the impact of this new accounting update to our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued update no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic measuring liabilities at fair value asu 
asu amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  of the fasb asc to provide further guidance on how to measure the fair value of a liability 
it primarily does three things sets forth the types of valuation techniques to be used to value a liability when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability and clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
this standard was effective beginning fourth quarter of and did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
effective july   we adopted the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles accounting standards codification 
this standard establishes only two levels of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  authoritative and nonauthoritative 
the fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc became the source of authoritative  nongovernmental gaap  except for rules and interpretive releases of the sec  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became nonauthoritative 
we began using the new guidelines and numbering system prescribed by the codification when referring to gaap in the third quarter of fiscal as the codification was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective april   we adopted three accounting standard updates which were intended to provide additional application guidance and enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities 
they also provide additional guidelines for estimating fair value in accordance with fair value accounting 
the first update  as codified in asc  provides additional guidelines for estimating fair value in accordance with fair value accounting 
the second accounting update  as codified in asc  changes accounting requirements for other than temporary impairment otti for debt securities by replacing the current requirement that a holder have the positive intent and ability to hold an impaired security to recovery in order to conclude an impairment was temporary with a requirement that an entity conclude it does not intend to sell an impaired security and it will not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
the third accounting update  as codified in asc  increases the frequency of fair value disclosures 
these updates were effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after june  the adoption of these accounting updates did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements see note for additional disclosures 
on january   we adopted a new accounting standard for collaborative arrangements included primarily under asc  previously referred to as eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
this guidance 
table of contents concluded that a collaborative arrangement is one in which the participants are actively involved and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the ultimate commercial success of the endeavor 
revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements are to be presented gross or net based on the criteria in previous accounting literature 
payments to or from collaborators are to be evaluated and presented based on the nature of the arrangement and its terms  the nature of the entity s business and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature 
the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements are to be disclosed along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements 
activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature  however  required disclosure under this guidance applies to the entire collaborative agreement 
this guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
the adoption of this guidance on january  did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
substantially all investments mature within approximately year from the date of purchase 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
at december   we held approximately million of student loan auction rate securities par value of million  classified as long term assets  which are substantially backed by the federal government 
beginning in february  auctions failed for the entire portfolio of our auction rate securities and have continued to fail since 
as a result our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
all of our auction rate securities are currently rated aaa  the highest rating by a rating agency  though a separate rating agency has downgraded two of our securities which we have considered in calculating fair value as of december  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record further impairment charges on these investments 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  including proceeds from our january public offering  and the results from our capacity trials  we currently anticipate the need to liquidate these investments prior to maturity or estimated time to recovery in order to execute our current business plans 
these investments were recorded at fair value as of december  based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of these securities 
given the current market environment  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change  which could result in significant changes to the fair value of 
table of contents these securities in future periods 
we used seven years as the expected holding period 
during  several of our auction rate securities with an aggregate fair value of million have been redeemed at or near par value 
the following table presents hypothetical fair values of our auction rate securities had we used different underlying terms  including up to years which approximates the actual maturity dates of the securities in millions  except percentages expected term of cash flows in years five seven ten thirty estimated fair value percentage of original par value million the table below presents the original principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages and beyond total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate convertible senior notes due average interest rate the table below presents the original principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages and beyond total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate convertible senior notes due average interest rate foreign currency market risk we purchase commercial and clinical products from bi and settle our obligations in a foreign currency 
this exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to protect against currency exchange risks on forecasted foreign currency cash payments for the purchases of actimmune from bi over the next year  we have considered instituting a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
in the past  we have hedged portions of our forecasted foreign currency cash payments with forward contracts 
when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the decline in the value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by losses in the value of the option or forward contracts designated as hedges 
conversely  when the dollar weakens  the increase in the value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts 
in  we used foreign currency forward contracts to partially mitigate this exposure  but have not entered into any new 
table of contents foreign currency forward contracts since that time 
we regularly evaluate the cost benefit of entering into such arrangements  and presently have no foreign currency hedge agreements outstanding 
global market and economic conditions in the united states  recent market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth which began in and continued into for the fiscal year ended december   continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  a declining real estate market in the us and added concerns fueled by the federal government interventions in the us financial and credit markets have contributed to instability in both united states and international capital and credit markets and diminished expectations for the us and global economy 
these conditions  combined with volatile energy prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to volatility in the markets and an economic slowdown 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of capital and credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
if volatile and adverse market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely borrow or access the capital and credit markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the economic slowdown may lead to reduced opportunities to raise sufficient additional capital to enable us to fund future operations  which would have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  the biotechnology industry has fluctuated significantly in the past and has experienced significant downturns in connection with  or in anticipation of  a deterioration in general economic conditions and we cannot accurately predict how severe and prolonged any downturn might be
