item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview to facilitate your review and understanding of this section of our report and the financial statements that follow  we are providing an overview of what management believes are the most important considerations for understanding our company and its business the key factors that drive our business and the principal associated risks 
who we are we are an investment grade rated since  publicly traded equity reit that invests in senior housing  long term care facilities and medical office buildings throughout the united states 
we strive to maximize total stockholder return by growing our asset base through a conservative  long term approach to real estate investments 
the healthcare sector is relatively recession resistant and presents unique growth potential as evidenced by favorable aging demographic trends and increasing market penetration of a rapidly growing senior population 
led by the aging baby boomer generation  the growth potential within the healthcare real estate sector will be driven by the increased use of healthcare services and  in each case  the recognized need for additional and improved healthcare facilities and services 
our management team has extensive operating backgrounds in senior housing and long term care that we believe provides us a competitive advantage in these sectors 
in  we established a full service medical office building platform comprised of a class a portfolio of facilities backed by well regarded property management services and development capabilities 
what we invest in we invest passively in the following types of geographically diversified healthcare properties senior housing assisted and independent living facilities alfs  ilfs and alzs 
this primarily private pay backed sector breaks down into three principal categories  each of which may be operated on a stand alone basis or combined with one or more of the others into a single facility or campus assisted living facilities alfs designed for frail seniors who can no longer live independently and instead need assistance with activities of daily living such as feeding  dressing and bathing but do not require round the clock skilled nursing care 
independent living facilities ilfs designed for seniors who pay for some concierge type services eg  meals  housekeeping  laundry  transportation  and social and recreational activities but require little  if any  assistance with activities of daily living 
alzheimer facilities alzs designed for those residents with significant cognitive impairment as a result of having alzheimer s or related dementia 
long term care skilled nursing facilities snfs 
this primarily government medicare and medicaid reimbursement backed sector consists of skilled nursing facilities designed for inpatient rehabilitative  restorative  skilled nursing and other medical treatment for residents who are medically stable and do not require the intensive care of an acute care or rehabilitative hospital 

table of contents continuing care retirement communities ccrcs 
these communities are designed to provide a continuum of care for residents as they age and their health deteriorates and typically combine on a defined campus integrated senior housing and long term care facilities 
medical office buildings mobs 
mobs usually house several different unrelated medical practices  although they can be associated with a large single specialty or multi specialty group 
mob tenants include physicians  dentists  psychologists  therapists and other healthcare providers  with space devoted to patient examination and treatment  diagnostic imaging  outpatient surgery and other outpatient services 
since an mob generally has several tenants under separate leases  they require day to day property management services that typically include rent collection from disparate tenants  re marketing space as it becomes vacant and  for non triple net leases  responsibility for many of the mob s associated operating expenses although many of these are  or can effectively be  passed through to the tenants as well 
mobs are generally classified as being either on campus or off campus 
on campus mobs typically are located on or immediately adjacent to an acute care hospital campus and are generally subject to a hospital ground lease 
its tenants are primarily doctors whose patients have been or will be treated at the hospital 
the relationship with a vibrant hospital tends to create stronger tenant demand  generate higher rental rates  provide higher tenant retention and discourage competitive new supply as compared to most off campus mobs that are unaffiliated with a healthcare system 
off campus mobs have become more and more prevalent as healthcare has increasingly shifted from the inpatient model to the typically less expensive outpatient model 
instead of typically being subject to a hospital ground lease with operating and use restrictions limiting the owner s control over the facility  including as a practical matter the ability to aggressively raise rents  owners of off campus mobs typically have full ownership of the facility and control over all leasing and operating decisions 
further  those affiliated with a healthcare system may also enjoy many of the same advantages as an on campus facility 
how we do it using a three prong foundation that focuses on proactive capital management  active portfolio management and quality funds from operations ffo growth  we typically invest in senior housing facilities  long term care facilities and medical office buildings as provided below 
senior housing and long term care facilities including ccrcs 
we primarily make our investments in these properties passively by acquiring an ownership interest in facilities and leasing them to unaffiliated tenants under triple net master leases that transfer the obligation for all facility operating costs insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance  capital improvements  etc 
to the tenants 
in addition  but to a much lesser extent because we view the risks of this activity to be greater due to less favorable bankruptcy treatment and other factors  from time to time  we extend mortgage loans and other financing to tenants  generally at higher rates than we charge for rent on our owned facilities to compensate us for the additional risk 
medical office buildings mobs 
we generally lease medical office buildings to multiple tenants under separate non triple net leases  where we are responsible for many of the associated operating expenses although many of these are  or can effectively be  passed through to the tenants  and to single tenants under triple net master leases like those referred to above 
until  we primarily made our multi tenant mob investments in mobs through joint ventures with specialists in this sector that would manage the venture and provide property management services 
since  we have expanded our capabilities by executing on our strategic initiative to establish a full service mob platform through a multi faceted transaction with pacific medical buildings llc 
we acquired from pacific medical buildings llc and certain of its affiliates interests in class a mobs for million in and two class a mobs for million in february these mobs comprise approximately million square feet and are located in california  nevada  arizona and oregon 
we also entered into an agreement pursuant to which we currently have the right  but not the obligation  to acquire up to approximately billion of mobs to be developed by pmb llc through april finally  we acquired from pmb a interest in pmb real estate services llc pmbres  a full service property management company 
pmbres 
table of contents provides property and asset management services for mobs  square feet  of which we own or have an ownership interest in 
how we measure our progress funds from operations and total stockholder return we believe that ffo is an important non gaap supplemental measure of operating performance because it excludes the effect of depreciation and gains losses from sales of facilities both of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance 
additionally  ffo is widely used by industry analysts as a measure of operating performance for equity reits 
we therefore discuss ffo  although it is a measurement that is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states it does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
in addition to ffo  we also believe total stockholder return to be a significant measure of our progress 
total stockholder return means  with respect to the company a the change in the market price of its common stock as quoted on the principal market on which it is traded during the performance period plus reinvested dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the common stock during the performance period  divided by b the market price of the common stock at the beginning of the performance period 
what we have accomplished over the last three years we have enjoyed numerous successes since the end of  perhaps the most notable of which are as follows investments 
we invested  directly and through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures  billion in the last three years  growing our gross investments in real estate from billion at the end of to billion at the end of during this period  we strategically diversified our asset base through investments in an mob platform and facilities representing of our investments at the end of coupled with our capital and portfolio management initiatives  over the past three years this growing asset base enabled us to accomplish the following quality  recurring ffo growth we increased our adjusted ffo per share over from per share in to per share in growing dividend we increased our cash dividend from per share in to per share in total stockholder return according to thomson reuters  we provided total stockholder return over the past three years compared to a total stockholder return provided by the companies within the healthcare sector of the nareit index  a negative total stockholder return provided by the companies comprising the nareit index and a negative total stockholder return provided by the companies comprising the s p index 
capital more flexible and diverse structure and conservative balance sheet 
our overall capital goal has been to balance the debt and equity components of our capital structure  increase our sources of capital  enhance our credit statistics  preserve and strengthen our investment grade credit ratings moody s investors service baa  standard poor s ratings service bbb and fitch ratings bbb and continue to protect our dividend 
in addition  in response to the crises in the capital and credit markets  in  we improved our liquidity 
we believe we have accomplished all of these goals  with the following items being particularly noteworthy over the past three years conservative leverage we reduced our debt to equity ratio on an undepreciated book basis from at the end of to at the end of  which ranked us at the top of all investment grade reits according to research provided by jp morgan securities and snl real estate through november 

table of contents multiple capital sources we added the following to our existing million credit facility and traditional marketed debt and equity capital sources at the market equity offering we implemented a program in under which we periodically issue equity with a targeted price greater than the volume weighted average price  subject to fees of under 
over the past three years  we have issued approximately million shares of common stock under this program  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
institutional joint venture capital we formed a joint venture in january with a state pension fund investor to provide an additional capital source 
the joint venture has invested million in assisted and independent living facilities  skilled nursing facilities and continuing care retirement communities  including million in facilities acquired by the joint venture from us  and has an approved capacity to invest up to million in these property types 
asset management capital in addition to the above sales to the institutional joint venture  in  we sold skilled nursing facilities primarily located in texas with an average age of years for million an capitalization rate on our rent  resulting in a gain on sale of million and invested a total of million at an average starting rate of in newer skilled nursing facilities located in multiple states 
in  we sold to emeritus senior housing assets previously leased to them for million a capitalization rate on our rent  resulting in a gain on sale of million and retained the net proceeds to bolster our liquidity 
enhanced credit statistics we increased our adjusted fixed charge coverage from x at the end of to x at the end of  which ranked us at the top of all investment grade reits according to research provided by jp morgan securities and snl real estate through november 
enhanced credit ratings in  both moody s and fitch upgraded us to baa and bbb  respectively  and s p bbb changed our outlook from stable to positive 
dividend secure and growing we maintained our dividend coverage ratio dividends per share divided by recurring diluted ffo per share at about  while our dividend increased 
maximized liquidity retained million in cash and full availability on our million credit line at the end of portfolio management implemented sophisticated program 
since the end of  we have continued to dramatically upgrade our portfolio management program by enhancing the proprietary software system we developed  adding four dedicated portfolio management personnel and proactively anticipating and responding to potential problem areas 
we believe we now have one of the most sophisticated portfolio management programs in our industry 
focus and outlook for consistent with the strengthening economy and capital markets  our strategic objective priority has shifted from liquidity preservation and balance sheet management to investment growth 
our financial strength allows flexibility to create and exploit growth opportunities related to our core acquisition business assisted living  skilled nursing  medical office as well as new development projects in healthcare real estate 
with the cost and availability of credit becoming more attractive  coupled with our million in cash and the full availability of our million credit facility at the end of  we believe we have adequate liquidity to address our business commitments over the next two years while also growing our business at a measured pace 
our plans for growth require efficient access to the capital and credit markets 
so long as capital continues to be available at an acceptable cost  we expect to be able to make further investments through quality acquisitions and development projects 
in  given the unprecedented disruptions to our economy in general and the capital markets in particular  generating meaningful growth in net income and ffo proved difficult 
in  we anticipate the early stages of a protracted economic recovery with more liquid and less volatile capital markets 
if the economic recovery holds  our primary focus for will return to continuing to improve our net income and ffo on an absolute and per share basis and further diversifying and upgrading our portfolio  while also continuing to explore alternative capital 
table of contents sources  investment structures  joint ventures and property types that would enable us to compete more effectively in the markets in which we invest 
if deflationary pressures continue to abate  we expect the rent escalators generally between and contained in many of our leases will be a source of meaningful built in internal net income and ffo growth 
however  since most of these escalators are tied to annual increases in the consumer price index  if that index starts trending negatively again as it did for most of  we are likely to see much less  if any  internal growth from these rent escalators as long as deflationary conditions continue 
investment growth appears possible as the unprecedented adverse capital markets and economic conditions and the resulting tighter credit conditions and slower growth that evolved in and continued through much of appear to be abating 
however  there still exists a wide range of directly conflicting outcomes possible for a small misstep in federal monetary policy could mean the difference between higher inflation and deflation 
we could slip back into a recession  if our economic recovery loses steam 
if a double dip recession occurs  we could return to the environment we saw in and much of where the systemic impact of energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy any or all of which may make it more difficult for some or many of our tenants to pay their rent 
our growth plans could be diminished  our financial position weakened and our ability to make distributions limited if we revert to an environment dominated by deteriorating general economic conditions or other factors leading to any of our major senior housing or other tenants being unable to meet their obligations to us 
we have no operational control over our tenants 
serious tenant financial problems could lead to more extensive restructurings or tenant disruptions than we currently expect 
this could be unique to a particular tenant or it could be industry related  such as continuing reduced occupancies for our assisted and independent living facilities due to severely distressed housing and credit markets  sustained unemployment or reduced federal or state governmental reimbursement levels in the case of our skilled nursing facilities with many states already facing severe budget deficits 
notwithstanding the amplified uncertainty that exists in the economy and capital markets  our focus for will be to make quality  accretive investments in existing healthcare assets as well as new development projects when opportunities arise 
simultaneously  we intend to plan for a range of possible outcomes that exist for through conservative capital management  proactive portfolio management and relevant enterprise risk management 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity  the capital and credit markets and the performance of our tenants  using our unique operating backgrounds to proactively identify and address potential problems that may develop 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different  it is possible that different accounting would have been applied  resulting in different presentation of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting estimates 
principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nhp  its wholly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures that are controlled through voting rights or other means 
we apply the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  consolidation asc  for arrangements with variable interest entities vies and would consolidate those vies where we are the primary beneficiary 
all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 

table of contents our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie involves the consideration of various factors including  but not limited to  the form of our ownership interest  our representation on the entity s governing body  the size of our investment  estimates of future cash flows  our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture  if applicable 
our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity or determine the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements 
we apply the provisions of asc topic  investments equity method and joint ventures  to investments in joint ventures 
investments in entities that we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of the entity s earnings or losses is included in our operating results 
revenue recognition rental income from operating leases is recognized in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  leases  and asc topic  revenue recognition 
our leases generally contain annual escalators 
many of our leases contain non contingent rent escalators for which we recognize income on a straight line basis over the lease term 
recognizing income on a straight line basis requires us to calculate the total non contingent rent to be paid over the life of a lease and to recognize the revenue evenly over that life 
this method results in rental income in the early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received  creating a straight line rent receivable asset included in the caption other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
at some point during the lease  depending on its terms  the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straight line rent which results in the straight line rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term 
we assess the collectability of straight line rents in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and our reserve policy and defer recognition of straight line rent if its collectability is not reasonably assured 
certain leases contain escalators contingent on revenues or other factors  including increases based on changes in the consumer price index 
such revenue increases are recognized as the related contingencies are met 
our assessment of the collectability of straight line rents is based on several factors  including the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the facility  the historical payment pattern of the tenant  the type of facility and whether we intend to continue to lease the facility to the current tenant  among others 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not receive the rent payments due in the future  we defer recognition of the straight line rental income and  depending on the circumstances  we will provide a reserve against the previously recognized straight line rent receivable asset for a portion  up to its full value  that we estimate may not be recoverable 
if we change our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectability of future rent payments required by a lease  we may adjust our reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue recognized  and or to increase or reduce the reserve against the existing straight line rent receivable balance 
we evaluate the collectability of the straight line rent receivable balances on an ongoing basis and provide reserves against receivables we believe may not be fully recoverable 
the ultimate amount of straight line rent we realize could be less than amounts currently recorded 
land  buildings and improvements and depreciation and useful lives of assets we record properties at cost and use the straight line method of depreciation for buildings and improvements over their estimated remaining useful lives of up to years  generally to years depending on factors including building type  age  quality and location 
we review and adjust useful lives periodically 
we allocate purchase prices of properties in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  business combinations asc  which require that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
asc also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
certain transaction costs that have historically been capitalized as acquisition costs are expensed for business combinations completed on or after 
table of contents january   which may have a significant impact on our future results of operations and financial position based on historical acquisition costs and activity levels 
the allocation of the cost between land  building and  if applicable  equipment and intangible assets and liabilities  and the determination of the useful life of a property are based on management s estimates  which are based in part on independent appraisals or other consultants reports 
for our triple net leased facilities  the allocation is made as if the property were vacant  and a significant portion of the cost of each property is allocated to buildings 
this amount generally approximates of the total property value 
historically  we have generally acquired properties and simultaneously entered into a new market rate lease for the entire property with one tenant 
for our multi tenant medical office buildings  the percentage allocated to buildings may be substantially lower as allocations are made to assets such as lease up intangible assets  above market tenant and ground lease intangible assets and in place lease intangible assets collectively intangible assets included on our consolidated balance sheets and or below market tenant and ground lease intangible liabilities included in the caption accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on equipment and lease costs using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of up to five years or the lease term  whichever is appropriate 
we amortize intangible assets and liabilities over the remaining lease terms of the respective leases to real estate amortization expense or medical office building operating rent  as appropriate 
we review and adjust useful lives periodically 
if we do not allocate appropriately between land and building or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our assets  our computation of depreciation and amortization will not appropriately reflect the usage of the assets over future periods 
if we overestimate the useful life of an asset  the depreciation expense related to the asset will be understated  which could result in a loss if the asset is sold in the future 
asset impairment we review our long lived assets individually on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  property  plant and equipment asc 
indicators may include  among others  a tenant s inability to make rent payments  operating losses or negative operating trends at the facility level  notification by a tenant that it will not renew its lease  or a decision to dispose of an asset or adverse changes in the fair value of any of our properties 
for operating assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we compare the undiscounted cash flows from the expected use of the property to its net book value to determine if impairment exists 
the evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected use of the property is highly subjective and is based in part on various factors and assumptions  including  but not limited to  historical operating results  available market information and known trends and market economic conditions that may affect the property  as well as  estimates of future operating income  occupancy  rental rates  leasing demand and competition 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is higher than the current net book value  we conclude no impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is lower than its current net book value  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value 
to the extent we decide to sell an asset  we recognize an impairment loss if the current net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value less selling costs 
we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture may exceed the fair value 
if it is determined that a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary and is below its carrying value  an impairment is recorded 
the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment 
our estimates consider all available evidence including  as appropriate  the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates  general economic conditions and trends and other relevant factors 
the above analyses require us to determine whether there are indicators of impairment for individual assets or investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows from operating assets and to determine the fair value of assets that are impaired or held for sale 
if our assumptions  projections or estimates regarding an asset change in the future  we may have to record an impairment charge to reduce or further reduce the net book value of such individual asset or investment in unconsolidated joint venture 

table of contents collectability of receivables we evaluate the collectability of our rent  mortgage loans and other receivables on a regular basis based on factors including  among others  payment history  the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  the operations and operating trends of the underlying collateral  if any  the asset type and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be recovered 
this analysis requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating a receivable may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the receivable that may not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectability of a receivable change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the carrying value of the receivable 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our compliance with reit requirements 
our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws  and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized 
adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal and state tax authorities  ii our ability to qualify as a reit  iii the potential for built in gain recognized related to prior tax free acquisitions of c corporations  and iv changes in tax laws 
adjustments required in any given period are included in income  other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations  which would be adjusted through goodwill 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb updated asc to require ongoing analyses to determine whether an entity s variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie  making it the primary beneficiary  based on whether the entity i has the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance  including whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure the vie operates as designed  and ii has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
enhanced disclosures regarding an entity s involvement with variable interest entities are also required under the provisions of asc these requirements are effective january  the adoption of these requirements is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu adds new requirements for disclosures of significant transfers into and out of levels  and of the fair value hierarchy  the reasons for the transfers and the policy for determining when transfers are recognized 
asu also adds new requirements for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross rather than net basis relating to the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of level recurring fair value measurements 
it also clarifies the level of disaggregation to require disclosures by class rather than by major category of assets and liabilities and clarifies that a description of inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value is required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements classified as level or asu is effective january  except for the requirements to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis which are effective january  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

discontinued operations income increased million in as compared to discontinued operations income of million for was comprised of gains on sale of million and rental income of million  offset in part by depreciation and amortization of million and interest expense of million 
discontinued operations income of million for was comprised of gains on sale of million  rental income of million and interest and other income of million  offset in part by depreciation and amortization expense of million and interest expense of million 
we expect to have future sales of facilities or reclassifications of facilities to assets held for sale  and the related income or loss would be included in discontinued operations unless the facilities were transferred to an entity in which we maintain an interest 
other factors that affect our business leases and mortgage loans our leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
if facility revenues and or the consumer price index do not increase  our revenues may not increase 
rent levels under renewed leases will also 
table of contents impact revenues 
excluding multi tenant medical office buildings  as of december   we had leases on facilities expiring in tenant purchase option exercises would decrease rental income 
we believe our tenants may exercise purchase options on assets with option prices totaling approximately million during acquisitions we may make acquisitions during  although we cannot predict the quantity or timing of any such acquisitions as we continue to be confronted with uncertainty surrounding the future of the capital markets and general economic conditions 
if we make additional investments in facilities  depreciation and or interest expense would also increase 
we expect any such increases to be at least partially offset by associated rental or interest income 
while additional investments in healthcare facilities would increase revenues  facility sales or mortgage repayments would serve to offset revenue increases and could reduce revenues 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash provided by operating activities during increased million  or  as compared to this was primarily due to revenue increases from our owned facilities and mortgage and other loans as a result of acquisitions  rent increases and funding of mortgage and other loans during and and increased intangible assets in  offset in part by the payment of certain amounts included in the caption accounts payable and accrued liabilities during and increased intangible lease liabilities related to our multi tenant medical office buildings in there have been no significant changes in the underlying sources and uses of cash provided by operating activities 
investing activities during  we funded million in expansions  construction and capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with existing lease provisions

the total value of this agreement was increased and the expiration date of this agreement was extended as a result of the termination of the contribution agreement described above with respect to six properties after the conditions for us to close on such properties were not satisfied

common stock dividends are paid at the discretion of our board of directors and are dependent upon various factors  including our future earnings  our financial condition and liquidity  our capital requirements and applicable legal and contractual restrictions 
on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
this dividend will be paid on march  to stockholders of record on february  at december   we had a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec under which we may issue securities including debt  convertible debt  common and preferred stock and warrants to purchase any of these securities 
on january   we filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec under which we may issue securities including debt  convertible debt  common and preferred stock and warrants to purchase any of these securities

we invest in various short term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income 
these investments may include either directly or indirectly obligations of the us government or its agencies  obligations including certificates of deposit of banks  commercial paper  money market funds and other highly rated short term securities 
we monitor our investments on a daily basis and do not believe our cash and cash equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss 
however  given the recent market volatility  there can be no assurances that future losses of principal will not occur 
recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slow growth 
while there are current signs of a strengthening and stabilizing economy and more liquid and attractive capital markets  there are continued concerns about the uncertainty over whether our economy will again be adversely impacted by inflation  deflation or stagflation  and the systemic impact of rising unemployment  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of capital  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us  resulting in a return to illiquid credit markets and widening credit spreads 
we had million available under our credit facility at december   and we have no current reason to believe that we will be unable to access the facility in the future 
however  continued concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of borrowers specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and  in some cases  cease to provide  funding to borrowers 
if we were unable to access our credit facility  it could result in an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
in addition  continued turbulence in market conditions may adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants 
at december   we had approximately million of indebtedness that matures in on february   we exercised a month extension option on a million loan that was scheduled to mature in april additionally  some of our senior notes can be put to us prior to the stated maturity date  however  there are no such senior notes that we may be required to repay in or if these recent market conditions continue or do not fully abate  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our tenants  to timely refinance maturing liabilities 
table of contents and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement of libor or other indexes 
if the recent market turbulence continues  there could be a rise in interest rates which could reduce our profitability or adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations 
our plans for growth require regular access to the capital and credit markets 
if capital is not available at an acceptable cost  it will significantly impair our ability to make future investments as acquisitions and development projects become difficult or impractical to pursue 
we anticipate the possible sale of certain facilities  primarily due to purchase option exercises 
in addition  mortgage loans receivable might be prepaid 
in the event that there are facility sales or mortgage loan receivable repayments in excess of new investments  revenues may decrease 
we anticipate using the proceeds from any facility sales or mortgage loans receivable repayments to provide capital for future investments  to reduce any outstanding balance on our credit facility or to repay other borrowings as they mature 
any such reduction in debt levels would result in reduced interest expense that we believe would partially offset any decrease in revenues 
we believe the combination of cash on hand  the ability to draw on our million credit facility and the ability to sell securities under the shelf registration statement  as well as our unconsolidated joint venture with a state pension fund investor  provide sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments  maintain our current dividend level and repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity  for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements the only off balance sheet financing arrangements that we currently utilize are the unconsolidated joint ventures discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements

we provide mortgage loans to tenants of healthcare facilities as part of our normal operations  which generally have fixed rates  and all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
we utilize debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  we have made short term borrowings on our credit facility to fund our acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
at our option  borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at the prime rate at december  or applicable libor plus at december  
on march   our credit rating from fitch ratings was upgraded to bbb from bbb  and on april   our credit rating from moody s was upgraded to baa from baa as a result  the spread over libor decreased from to 
at december  and december   we did not have any borrowings under our credit facility 
additionally  a portion of our secured debt has variable rates 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
we generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
any future interest rate increases will increase the cost of borrowings on our credit facility and any borrowings to refinance long term debt as it matures or to finance future acquisitions 
holding the variable rate debt balance at december  constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
the table below details the principal amounts and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates as of december  certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity 
maturity date total book thereafter value fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate unsecured senior credit facility average interest rate total book value of mortgage loans excludes deferred gains and discounts of million
