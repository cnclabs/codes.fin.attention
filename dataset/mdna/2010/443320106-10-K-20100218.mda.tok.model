rent paid under this agreement totaled million for the year ended december  the annual lease payments escalate by less than per year 
minimum annual rental commitments  as of december   under non cancelable operating leases  principally for real estate  containers and equipment are payable as follows in thousands and thereafter deferred compensation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan the plan  participants can elect to defer certain compensation 
payments under the plan are due as follows in thousands and thereafter critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
in certain circumstances  those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and estimates 
allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable in the normal course of business  we extend credit to customers after a review of each customer s credit history 
an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts has been established through an analysis of the accounts receivable aging  an assessment of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation based on current economic conditions 
to be more specific  we reserve a portion of every account balance that has aged over one year  a portion of receivables for customers in bankruptcy and certain account balances specifically identified as uncollectible 
on an annual basis  we perform a hindsight analysis to determine our experience in collecting account balances over one year old and account balances in bankruptcy 
we then use this hindsight analysis to establish our reserves for receivables over one year and in bankruptcy 
in establishing a reserve for certain account balances specifically identified as uncollectible  we consider the aging of the customer receivables  the customer s current and projected financial results  the customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook and the general economic conditions 
the company s level of reserves for its customer accounts receivable fluctuate depending upon all the factors mentioned above 
however  we do not expect the reserve for uncollectible accounts to change significantly relative to our accounts receivable balance 
historically  our reserve for uncollectible accounts has approximated actual accounts written off 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is reported on the balance sheet in net accounts receivable 
recoveries of receivables previously charged off are recorded when received 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue and related transportation costs are recognized based on relative transit time 
further  we report revenue on a gross basis because we are the primary obligor and are responsible for providing the service desired by the customer 
the customer views us as responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the service 
service requirements may include  for example  on time delivery  handling freight loss and damage claims  setting up appointments for pick up and delivery and tracing shipments in transit 
we have discretion in setting sales prices and as a result  our earnings vary 
in addition  we have the discretion to select our vendors from multiple suppliers for the services ordered by our customers 
finally  we have credit risk for our receivables 
these three factors  discretion in setting prices  discretion in selecting vendors and credit risk  further support reporting revenue on the gross basis 
provision for income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income projections with the exception of million related to state tax net operating losses for which a valuation allowance has been established 
in the event the probability of realizing the remaining deferred tax assets do not meet the more likely than not threshold in the future  a valuation allowance would be established for the deferred tax assets deemed unrecoverable 
tax liabilities are recorded when  in management s judgment  a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition as prescribed by the guidance 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold  a tax liability may be recorded depending on management s assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled 
valuation of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles we review goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired if its fair value is less than its carrying value 
goodwill impairment is indicated if the fair value of the reporting unit is less that its carrying value 
an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill 
we utilize a third party independent valuation firm to assist in performing the necessary valuations to be used in the impairment testing 
these valuations are based on a market comparable approach  a discounted cash flow approach or a combination of both approaches 
the fair value measurement is determined based on assumptions that a market participant would use including expectations regarding future operating performance which are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans  discount rates  control premiums and other factors which are subjective in nature 
as of december   reasonable variations in these assumptions do not have a significant impact on the results of the goodwill impairment test 
actual cash flows from operations could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance and economic conditions 
valuation of finite lived intangibles and fixed assets we evaluate the potential impairment of finite lived intangible assets and fixed assets when impairment indicators exist 
if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
equipment we operate tractors and utilize containers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements 
in addition  we rent equipment from third parties and various railroads under short term rental arrangements 
equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life 
we had no equipment under capital lease arrangements as of december  or our equipment leases have five to seven year terms and in some cases contain renewal options 
stock based compensation share based compensation includes the restricted stock awards expected to vest based on the grant date fair value 
compensation expense is amortized straight line over the vesting period and is included in salaries and benefits 
fair value measurement in september  the fasb issued guidance in the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification 
this guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb deferred the effective date of this guidance for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for those items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we adopted the guidance effective january  for all financial assets and liabilities 
as of january   we adopted the guidance for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
there is no impact on our financial statements as of december  new pronouncements in december  the fasb issued guidance in the business combinations topic of the codification 
this guidance requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values including contingent consideration 
in addition  this guidance changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from preacquisition contingencies and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
the guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we adopted this guidance effective january  any impact would be on future acquisitions 
in april  the fasb issued guidance in the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the codification on the determination of the useful life of an intangible asset 
this guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted this guidance effective january  and it had no impact on our financial statements 
the fasb issued guidance in the subsequent events topic of the codification in may the guidance is intended to establish general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
we adopted this guidance effective for the quarter ending june  the adoption of this guidance had no impact on our financial statements as of december   other than the additional disclosure 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation  codified primarily in the consolidation topic of the fasb asc 
this guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
in addition  this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a company s involvement with a variable interest entity 
the company adopted this guidance effective january   as required 
the effect of adopting this standard was not significant 
outlook  risks and uncertainties business combinations divestitures we believe that any future acquisitions that we may make could significantly impact financial results 
financial results most likely to be impacted include  but are not limited to  revenue  gross margin  salaries and benefits  selling general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  net income and our debt level 
revenue we believe that the performance of the railroads and a severe or prolonged slow down of the economy are the most significant factors that could negatively influence our revenue growth rate 
should there be further consolidation in the rail industry causing a service disruption  we believe our intermodal business would likely be negatively impacted 
should there be a significant service disruption  we expect that there may be some customers who would switch from using our intermodal service to other transportation services 
we expect that these customers may choose to continue to utilize other services even when intermodal service levels are restored 
other factors that could negatively influence our growth rate include  but are not limited to  the elimination of fuel surcharges  the entry of new competitors  customer retention  inadequate drayage service and inadequate equipment supply 
gross margin we expect fluctuations in gross margin as a percentage of revenue from quarter to quarter caused by various factors including  but not limited to  changes in the transportation business mix  insurance costs  trailer and container capacity  vendor pricing  fuel costs  intermodal industry growth  intermodal industry service levels  accessorials  competitive pricing and accounting estimates 
salaries and benefits we estimate that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between volume increases and changes in levels of staffing 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses  changes in customer requirements  changes in our operating structure  how well we perform against our eps goals  and changes in railroad intermodal service levels which could result in a lower or higher cost of labor per move 
general and administrative we believe there are several factors that could cause general and administrative expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue 
as customer expectations and the competitive environment require the development of web based business interfaces and the restructuring of our information systems and related platforms  we believe there could be significant expenses incurred  some of which would not be capitalized 
other factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expense to fluctuate include  but are not limited to  changes in insurance premiums  bad debt expenses and outside services expense 
depreciation and amortization we estimate that depreciation and amortization of property and equipment in will approximate impairment of property and equipment  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on an ongoing basis  we assess the realizability of our assets 
if  at any point during the year  management determines that an impairment exists  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced by the estimated impairment with a corresponding charge to earnings which management estimates could have a material adverse impact on earnings 
other income expense factors that could cause a change in interest income include  but are not limited to  change in interest rates  change in investments  funding working capital needs  funding capital expenditures  funding an acquisition and buying back stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our bank line of credit which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have no significant exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes 
no derivative financial instruments were outstanding as of december  and we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of december  and  the company had no outstanding obligations under its bank line of credit arrangement
