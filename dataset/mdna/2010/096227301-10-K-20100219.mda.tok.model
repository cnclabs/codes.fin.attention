in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview bluefly  inc is a leading internet retailer that sells over brands of designer apparel  accessories and home furnishings at discounts of up to off of retail value 
we launched our web site in september our net sales decreased approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  our gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from in the increase in gross margin was primarily related to an increase in improved product margins and a decrease in inventory reserves  in connection with the increase in improved product margins  caused by a shift in our merchandise mix 
our gross profit decreased by approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to a decrease in net sales 
total marketing expenses including staff related costs decreased by to  for the year ended december  from  for year ended december  we decreased our spending in marketing excluding staff related costs by to  for the full year from  for the full year this decrease consisted primarily of a decrease in fixed costs relating to offline programs of approximately and a decrease in variable costs related to online programs 
the decreased spending resulted from a planned decrease in inventory purchases in response to the overall decline in consumer spending 
inventory spending decreased approximately compared to marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  during  offline advertising expenses decreased  which caused the mix of marketing expenditures to shift toward online media 
management determined that online marketing programs were more efficient and more easily measurable 
we incurred an operating loss of  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the improvement in operating loss was primarily a result of decreases in variable operating fulfillment expenses  marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
we believe that the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to our planned decrease in inventory purchases in response to the overall decline in consumer spending 
our reserve for returns and credit card chargebacks for the year ended december  decreased to compared to and of gross sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
historically  our merchandise mix had been shifting towards higher end products  which tended to drive return rates higher 
during  we refined our merchandising mix to shift towards more contemporary merchandise and we believe this resulted in a decrease in the return rate 
additionally  we believe that the reduction in return rate was partially caused by customers making fewer impulse purchases  which are generally more likely to be returned 
a portion of our inventory includes merchandise on a pack and hold basis  where we either purchased with the intention of holding for the appropriate season or were unable to sell through in its entirety in a prior season and have determined to hold for the next selling season  subject in some cases to appropriate mark downs 
while we have historically increased the amount of inventory purchased on a pack and hold basis  we have made increased selective purchases of inventory in order to take advantage of opportunities in the current economic environment 
we recorded total share based compensation expenses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents at december   we had an accumulated deficit of  the net losses and accumulated deficit resulted primarily from the costs associated with developing and marketing our web site and building our infrastructure  as well as non cash beneficial conversion charges resulting from decreases in the conversion price of our preferred stock and the payment of dividends to holders of preferred stock 
critical accounting policies management estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions include the adequacy of the allowances for sales returns  recoverability of inventories  useful lives of property and equipment  the realization of deferred tax assets  and the calculations related to stock based compensation 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
in addition  we currently estimate that we will have adequate liquidity to fund operations beyond december  such estimate is based on projected revenues  expenses and timing of various payments 
should unforeseen events occur or should actual results differ from current estimates  we may be unable to meet payment obligations as they come due which would have a material adverse impact on our operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete and revenue is measurable 
gross sales consist primarily of revenue from product sales and shipping and handling charges and are net of promotional discounts 
net sales represent gross sales  less provision for returns  credit card chargebacks  and adjustments for uncollected sales taxes 
revenue is recognized when all the following criteria are met a customer executes an order 
the product price and the shipping and handling fee have been determined 
credit card authorization has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
the product has been shipped and received by the customer 
deferred revenue  which consists primarily of goods shipped to customers but not yet received and customer credits is classified as current liabilities on our balance sheets 
shipping and handling billed to customers are classified as revenue and freight cost incurred in connection with purchasing merchandise is classified as cost of goods sold 
provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts we now permit returns for any reason within days of the sale 
accordingly  we establish a reserve for estimated future returns and bad debt at the time of shipment based primarily on historical data 
we perform credit card authorizations and check the verification of our customers prior to shipment of merchandise 
however  our future return and bad debt rates could differ from historical patterns  and  to the extent that these rates increase significantly  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
for the years ended december   and  our returns reserves were  and  respectively  of gross sales 
actual charges have not varied materially from historical percentages 
inventory valuation inventories  which consist of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information  about the saleability of such merchandise and the selling price  among other factors 
based upon this evaluation  we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and establish a reserve for such merchandise 
deferred tax valuation allowance we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the 
table of contents effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is realized in income or loss in the period that included the enactment date 
we have assessed the future taxable income and determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
effective january   we adopted authoritative guidance relating to uncertainty in income taxes 
it prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that they have taken or expect to take on a tax return 
as of december  and  the only tax jurisdiction to which we are subject to is the united states 
open tax years relate to years in which unused net operating losses were generated 
as of the adoption of this authoritative guidance  our open tax years extend back to in the event that we conclude that we are subject to interest and or penalties arising from uncertain tax positions  we will present interest and penalties as a component of income taxes 
no amounts of interest or penalties were recognized in our statements of operations or balance sheets upon adoption of this authoritative guidance or as of and for the years ended december  and stock based compensation authoritative guidance relating to stock based compensation requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected forfeitures 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statements of operations data for the years ended december st 
all data is in thousands except as indicated below as a of as a of as a of net sales net sales net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and fulfillment expenses marketing expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses operating loss interest expense income  net net loss we also measure and evaluate ourselves against certain other key operational metrics 
the following table sets forth our actual results based on these other metrics for the years ended december st  as indicated below average order size including shipping handling new customers added during the year based on unique email addresses 
table of contents in addition to the financial statement items and metrics listed above  which are non gaap financial measurements  we also report gross sales  another non gaap financial measurement 
we define gross sales as the total dollar amount of orders received by customers including shipping and handling net of customer credits  but before any reserves are taken for returns or bad debt 
we believe that the presentation of gross sales is useful to investors because it provides an alternative measure of the total demand for the products sold by us and it provides a basis upon which to measure the percentage of total demand that is reserved for both returns and bad debt 
management uses the gross sales measure for these same reasons 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales gross sales for the year ended december  decreased by approximately to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross sales was primarily attributable to our planned decrease in inventory purchases in response to the overall decline in consumer spending and our streamlined business plan prior to our recent private placement

the decrease in this provision as a percentage of gross sales resulted from a reduction in the return rate  which was  in part  caused by a shift in our merchandise mix 
in addition  we believe that the reduction in return rate was partially caused by customers making fewer impulse purchases  which are generally more likely to be returned
