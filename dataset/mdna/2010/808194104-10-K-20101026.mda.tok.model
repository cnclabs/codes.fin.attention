such net operating losses are offset against the foreign dividend income  which would otherwise generate us taxable income 
the dividend income from foreign subsidiaries also generates foreign tax credits  which either partially offset the tax on any us taxable income remaining after the offset of the net operating losses  or are carried forward 
for the current year  the us tax liability associated with foreign dividends could not entirely be offset by foreign tax credits due to certain historical tax attributes of ico
