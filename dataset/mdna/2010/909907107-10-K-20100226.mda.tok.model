item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements congress passed the private securities litigation act of to encourage corporations to provide investors with information about the company s anticipated future financial performance  goals  and strategies 
the act provides a safe haven for such disclosure  in other words  protection from unwarranted litigation if actual results are not the same as management expectations 
united desires to provide its shareholders with sound information about past performance and future trends 
consequently  any forward looking statements contained in this report  in a report incorporated by reference to this report  or made by management of united in this report  in any other reports and filings  in press releases and in oral statements  involve numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by 
table of contents united s statements for a variety of factors including  but not limited to changes in economic conditions  business conditions in the banking industry  movements in interest rates  competitive pressures on product pricing and services  success and timing of business strategies  the nature and extent of governmental actions and reforms  and rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards 
introduction the following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in financial condition and the results of operations of united and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated below 
this discussion and the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements include the accounts of united bankshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  unless otherwise indicated 
management has evaluated all significant events and transactions that occurred after december   but prior to february   the date these financial statements were issued  for potential recognition or disclosure required in these financial statements 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this document 
application of critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments  which are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors  are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses  the valuation of investment securities and the related other than temporary impairment analysis  the accounting for and the valuation of derivative instruments  and the calculation of the income tax provision to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by united are presented in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the lending portfolio 
determining the allowance for credit losses requires management to make forecasts of losses that are highly uncertain and require a high degree of judgment 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million and is subject to periodic adjustment based on management s assessment of current probable losses in the loan portfolio 
such adjustment from period to period can have a significant impact on united s consolidated financial statements 
to illustrate the potential effect on the financial statements of our estimates of the allowance for loan losses  a increase in the allowance for loan losses would have required million in additional allowance funded by additional provision for credit losses  which would have negatively impacted the year of net income by approximately million  or diluted per common share 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and the appropriate provision for credit losses is based upon a quarterly evaluation of the loan portfolio and lending related commitments 
this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates  including estimates related to the amounts and timing of future cash flows  value of collateral  losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which are susceptible to constant and significant change 
the allowance allocated to specific credits and loan pools grouped by similar risk characteristics is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary based upon subsequent changes in circumstances 
in determining the components of the allowance for credit losses  management considers the risk arising in part from  but not limited to  charge off and delinquency trends  current economic and business conditions  lending policies and procedures  the size and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  concentrations of credit  and other various factors 
the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses is described in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the factors leading to changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the provision for credit losses section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial 
table of contents condition and results of operations md a 
as discussed in the md a  the increase in the allowance for credit losses in as compared to can be directly attributed to the current economic environment 
for a discussion of concentrations of credit risk  see item  under the caption of loan concentrations in this form k 
accounting estimates are used in the presentation of the investment portfolio and these estimates impact the presentation of united s financial condition and results of operations 
united classifies its investments in debt and equity securities as either held to maturity or available for sale 
securities held to maturity are accounted for using historical costs  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
securities available for sale are accounted for at fair value  with the net unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax effects  presented as a separate component of stockholders equity 
when available  fair values of securities are based on quoted prices or prices obtained from third party vendors 
third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data 
prices obtained from third party vendors that do not reflect forced liquidation or distressed sales are not adjusted by management 
where prices reflect forced liquidation or distressed sales  as is the case with united s portfolio of pooled trust preferred securities  management estimates fair value based on a discounted cash flow methodology using appropriately adjusted discount rates reflecting nonperformance and liquidity risks 
due to the subjective nature of this valuation process  it is possible that the actual fair values of these securities could differ from the estimated amounts  thereby affecting united s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the potential impact to united s financial position  results of operations or cash flows for changes in the valuation process cannot be reasonably estimated 
if the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost  the investment is considered impaired and management evaluates whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
if such an event or change has occurred  management must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie  temporary or other than temporary in order to apply the appropriate accounting treatment 
if united intends to sell  or is more likely than not will be required to sell an impaired debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings 
the amount recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if united does not intend to sell  and is not more likely than not they will be required to sell the impaired debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is separated into the following the amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and the amount related to all other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
given the recent disruptions in the financial markets  the decision to recognize other than temporary impairment on investment securities has become more difficult as complete information is not always available and market conditions and other relevant factors are subject to rapid changes 
therefore  the other than temporary impairment assessment has become a critical accounting policy for united 
for additional information on management s consideration of investment valuation and other than temporary impairment  see note b and note r  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management activities to protect the value of certain assets and liabilities against adverse price or interest rate movements 
all derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
united considers derivative instruments to be a critical accounting policy due to the complexity and judgment associated with the implementation of the accounting guidance and because carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility 
the accounting policies utilized by the company to record derivatives reflect the guidance in the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification and other related accounting guidance 
in accordance with the guidance  all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are provided by third parties 
accounting for changes in the fair value of a particular derivative differs depending on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
at december   united has one derivative designated as a cash flow hedge and three derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance  as well as to assess hedge effectiveness  identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items 
at december   united also has three derivatives not included in hedge relationships 
such derivatives consist of interest rate swaps used for interest rate management purposes and derivatives executed with commercial banking customers to facilitate their interest rate management strategies 
gains and losses on other derivative financial instruments are included in noninterest income and noninterest expense  respectively 
management believes that its methods of addressing these 
table of contents judgmental areas and applying the guidance are in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry practices 
interpretations of the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification and related guidance continue to change and evolve 
future interpretations could result in material changes to united s accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities 
although such changes may not have a material effect on financial condition  they could have a material adverse effect on united s results of operations in the period they occur 
however  the potential impact to united s operating results for such changes cannot be reasonably estimated 
additional information relating to united s use of derivatives is included in note n  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united s calculation of income tax provision is inherently complex due to the various different tax laws and jurisdictions in which we operate and requires management s use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
the current income tax liability also includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions as required in asc topic  income taxes 
changes to the estimated accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates  implementation of new business strategies  resolution of issues with taxing authorities and recently enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance 
these changes can be material to the company s operating results for any particular reporting period 
the analysis of the income tax provision requires the assessments of the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions  filing positions  filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other information 
united strives to keep abreast of changes in the tax laws and the issuance of regulations which may impact tax reporting and provisions for income tax expense 
united is also subject to audit by federal and state authorities 
because the application of tax laws is subject to varying interpretations  results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from united s estimates and provisions 
united continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of probable exposure based on current facts and circumstances 
the potential impact to united s operating results for any of the changes cannot be reasonably estimated 
see note j  notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding united s asc topic disclosures 
any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is further discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
use of fair value measurements united determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in asc topic  whereby the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
asc topic establishes a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs in the methodology for determining fair value are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market based information obtained from independent sources level or level  while unobservable inputs reflect management s estimate of market data level 
for assets and liabilities that are actively traded and have quoted prices or observable market data  a minimal amount of subjectivity concerning fair value is needed 
prices and values obtained from third party vendors that do not reflect forced liquidation or distressed sales are not adjusted by management 
when quoted prices or observable market data are not available  management s judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
at december   approximately of total assets  or million  consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value 
of this total  approximately or million of these financial instruments used valuation methodologies involving observable market data  collectively level and level measurements  to determine fair value 
approximately or million of these financial instruments were valued using unobservable market information or level measurements 
most of these financial instruments valued using unobservable market information were pooled trust preferred investment securities classified as available for sale 
at december   only million or less than of total liabilities were recorded at fair value 
this entire amount was valued using methodologies involving observable market data 
united does not believe that any changes in the unobservable inputs used to value the financial instruments mentioned above would have a material impact on united s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
see note r for additional information regarding asc topic and its impact on united s financial statements 

table of contents compared to financial condition summary united s total assets as of december  were billion which was a decline of million or from december  the decrease was primarily the result of decreases in investment securities and portfolio loans of million or and million or  respectively 
partially offsetting these decreases to total assets was a million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease in total assets is reflected in a corresponding decrease in total liabilities of million or from year end the decrease in total liabilities was due mainly to a reduction of million or in borrowings while accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased million or 
deposits increased million or from year end shareholders equity increased million or from year end the following discussion explains in more detail the changes in financial condition by major category 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at december  increased million or from year end as united placed its excess cash in an interest bearing account with the federal reserve 
of this total increase  interest bearing deposits with other banks increased million due mainly to the cash placed at the federal reserve while cash and due from banks decreased million or and federal funds sold decreased million or 
during the year of  net cash of million and million was provided by operating activities and investing activities  respectively 
net cash of million was used in financing activities 
further details related to changes in cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
securities total investment securities decreased million or from year end securities available for sale declined million or 
this change in securities available for sale reflects million in sales  maturities and calls of securities  million in purchases  and a slight increase of thousand in market value 
securities held to maturity decreased million or from year end due to calls and maturities of securities 
other investment securities were relatively flat  only declining thousand or less than from year end due to an other than temporary impairment charge of thousand on an investment security during the second quarter of the following is a summary of available for sale securities at december in thousands us treasury and other us government agencies and corporations states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities marketable equity securities corporate securities total available for sale securities  at amortized cost total available for sale securities  at fair value 
table of contents the following is a summary of held to maturity securities at december in thousands us treasury and other us government agencies and corporations states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities corporate securities total held to maturity securities  at amortized cost total held to maturity securities  at fair value gross unrealized losses on investment securities were million at december  securities in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more at december  consisted primarily of mortgage backed and corporate securities 
the unrealized loss on mortgage backed securities portfolio relates primarily to aaa securities of various private label issuers 
the unrealized loss on corporate securities was mainly related to single issue trust preferred securities and trust preferred collateralized debt obligations 
as of december   united s corporate securities had an amortized cost of million  with an estimated fair value of million 
the portfolio consisted primarily of million in pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of million and million in single issue trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of million 
in addition to the trust preferred securities  the company held positions in various other securities with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million  none of which were individually significant 
the pooled trust preferred securities consisted of positions in different securities 
the underlying issuers in the pools were primarily financial institutions and to a lesser extent  insurance companies 
the company has no exposure to real estate investment trusts reits in its investment portfolio 
the company owns both senior and mezzanine tranches in pooled trust preferred securities  however  the company does not own any income notes 
the senior and mezzanine tranches of trust preferred collateralized debt obligations generally have some protection from defaults in the form of over collateralization and excess spread revenues  along with waterfall structures that redirect cash flows in the event certain coverage test requirements are failed 
generally  senior tranches have the greatest protection  with mezzanine tranches subordinated to the senior tranches  and income notes subordinated to the mezzanine tranches 
senior tranches represent million of the company s pooled securities  while mezzanine tranches represent million 
of the million in mezzanine tranches  million are now in the senior position as the senior notes have been paid to a zero balance 
as of december   million of the pooled trust preferred securities were investment grade  while million were split rated with one investment grade rating and one below investment grade rating  and million were below investment grade 
in terms of capital adequacy  the company allocates additional risk based capital to the below investment grade securities 
of the million in single issue trust preferred securities at december   million or were investment grade  million or were unrated  million or were split rated  and million or were below investment grade 
the three largest exposures accounted for of the million 
these included wells fargo at million  suntrust bank at million and peoples bancorp  inc at million 
all single issue trust preferred securities are currently receiving full scheduled principal and interest payments 
management recognized net other than temporary impairment charges totaling million on both single issue trust preferred securities and pooled trust preferred securities during other than these securities  management does not believe that any other individual security with an unrealized loss as of december  is other than temporarily impaired 
united believes the decline in value resulted from changes in market interest rates  credit spreads and liquidity  not an adverse change in the expected contractual cash flows 
based on a review of each of the securities in the investment portfolio  management concluded that is was not probable that it would be unable to realize the cost basis investment and appropriate interest payments on such securities 
united has the intent and the ability to hold these securities until such time as the value recovers or the securities mature 
however  united acknowledges that any impaired securities may be sold in future periods in response to significant  unanticipated changes in asset liability management decisions  unanticipated future market movements or business plan changes 

table of contents more information relating to investment securities is presented in note b  notes to consolidated financial statements 
loans loans held for sale increased million as loan originations exceeded loan sales in the secondary market during the year of portfolio loans  net of unearned income  decreased million or from year end due mainly to a decrease in commercial loans not secured by real estate of million or 
single family residential real estate loans and construction loans declined million or and million or  respectively 
commercial real estate loans decreased million or while other real estate loans increased million or  respectively 
consumer loans decreased million or

table of contents other assets other assets increased million or from year end due mainly to increases of million in prepaid fdic assessments due to a required three year prepayment of premiums  million in oreo due to increased foreclosures as a result of the current economic conditions  million in the prepaid pension assets due to a contribution payment of million in the third quarter of  million in deferred tax assets  million in income taxes receivable and million in the cash surrender values of bank owned life insurance policies 
the increase in income taxes receivable for the year of was due to a tax benefit associated with net operating loss carryforwards and a positive adjustment to income taxes as a result of a concluded state tax examination 
partially offsetting these increases from year end were decreases in core deposit intangibles of million due to amortization and derivatives assets of million due to a change in fair value 
deposits deposits represent united s primary source of funding 
total deposits at december  increased million or from year end in terms of composition  noninterest bearing deposits increased million or while interest bearing deposits increased million or from december  the increase in noninterest bearing deposits was due mainly to increases in commercial noninterest bearing deposits of million or  personal noninterest bearing deposits of million or and official checks of million or 
the increase in interest bearing deposits was due mainly to an increase in time deposits over  of million or 
most of this increase was due mainly to a shift in certificate of deposit account registry service cdars balances from certificate of deposits under  as a result of the increase in the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage from  to  interest bearing money market accounts mmdas increased million or 
in addition  regular savings balances increased million or and interest bearing checking deposits increased million or

accrued expenses and other liabilities accrued expenses and other liabilities at december  decreased million or from year end mainly as a result of decreases of million in derivative liabilities due to a change in fair value and million in interest payable due to a decline in borrowings and interest rates on certificate of deposits 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in deferred compensation of million and income taxes payable of million 

table of contents shareholders equity shareholders equity at december  increased million or from december  as united continued to balance capital adequacy and the return to shareholders 
the increase in shareholders equity was due mainly to increases in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income 
retained earnings increased due to earnings net of dividends declared which equaled million for the year of accumulated other comprehensive income increased million due mainly to an increase of million in united s pension benefit obligation  net of deferred income taxes and the amortization of pension costs of million  net of deferred income taxes 
the fair value of united s cash flow hedge increased million  net of deferred income taxes while the fair value of united s available for sale investment portfolio increased thousand  net of deferred income taxes 
earnings summary net income for the year was million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for the year of these results for the year of included noncash before tax other than temporary impairment charges of million on certain investment securities  a credit loss provision of million for three loans with fraudulent collateral made to three affiliated companies of a commercial customer and an additional expense of million for a special fdic assessment 
results for the year of also included an income tax benefit of million associated with net operating loss carryforwards and a positive adjustment to income tax expense as a result of a concluded tax examination as well as an additional positive tax adjustment of thousand due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for examinations of certain years 
results for the year of included noncash before tax other than temporary impairment charges of million on certain investment securities 
also included in the results for the year of was a positive tax adjustment of million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for examinations of certain years and a thousand before tax gain related to visa s initial public offering and the partial redemption of visa shares held by united

the provision for credit losses was million for the year as compared to million for the year of noninterest income was million for the year of  down million or when compared to the year of included in noninterest income for the year of and were the previously mentioned noncash before tax other than temporary impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
noninterest expense was million  an increase of million or for the year of when compared to income tax expense for the year of was million as compared to million for the year of during the third quarter of  united reduced its income tax reserve by thousand due to the expiration of the statue of limitations for examinations of certain years as compared to million in the third quarter of during the first quarter of  united recorded a benefit associated with net operating loss carryforwards and a positive adjustment to income tax expense as a result of a concluded tax examination 
the total income tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of related to these two events was million 
as a result of these tax adjustments  united s effective tax rate was approximately and for years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to for the following discussion explains in more detail the results of operations by major category 

table of contents net interest income net interest income represents the primary component of united s earnings 
it is the difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense incurred to fund these assets 
net interest income is impacted by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in market interest rates 
such changes  and their impact on net interest income in and  are presented below 
net interest income for the year of was million  a decrease of million or from the year of the million decrease in net interest income occurred because total interest income declined million while total interest expense only declined million from the year of for the purpose of this remaining discussion  net interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
the tax equivalent basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
although this is a non gaap measure  united s management believes this measure is more widely used within the financial services industry and provides better comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
united uses this measure to monitor net interest income performance and to manage its balance sheet composition 
tax equivalent net interest income for the year of was million  a decrease of million or from the year of the net interest margin for the year of was  down basis points from a net interest margin of during the same period last year 
tax equivalent interest income for the year of was million  a million or decrease from the year of this decrease in tax equivalent interest income was primarily attributable to a decrease of basis points in the yield on average earning assets due to a decrease in market interest rates 
the average yield on net loans was for the year of  down basis points from for the year of while the average yield on investment securities was for the year of  a decrease of basis points from for the year of in addition  average earning assets were relatively flat from the year of  declining million or less than as average investment securities decreased million or 
average net loans were virtually flat from the year of  increasing million or less than 
interest expense for the year of was million  a decrease of million or from the year of the decrease in interest expense for the year of was mainly due to a decrease of basis points in the cost of funds from the year of as a result of lower market interest rates during the average cost of interest bearing deposits was for the year of  down basis points from for the year of while the average cost of short term borrowings was for the year of  a decrease of basis points from for the year of the average cost of long term borrowings was for the year of  a decrease of basis points from for the year of as a result of a decrease in market interest rates and the prepayment of higher rate fhlb advances in average interest bearing deposits increased million or while average short term borrowings decreased million or 
average long term borrowings were relatively flat from the year of  increasing million or less than

provision for credit losses at december   nonperforming loans were million or of loans  net of unearned income compared to nonperforming loans of million or of loans  net of unearned income at december  the increase in nonperforming loans since year end is indicative of the decline in economic conditions during these nonperforming loans are not of one particular portfolio  but rather represent several customer segments 
higher unemployment levels  economic fears  and declines in real estate values have impacted the performance of both consumer and commercial portfolios 
the components of nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  but have not been put on a nonaccrual basis and loans whose terms have been restructured for economic or legal reasons due to financial difficulties of the borrowers 
loans past due days or more were million at december   an increase of million or from million at year end at year end  nonaccrual loans were million  an increase of million or from million at year end restructured loans were million at year end as compared to no restructured loans at year end the increase in loans past due days or more  nonaccrual loans and restructured loans since year end was primarily the result of the deterioration in economic conditions during the loss potential on

the following table summarizes nonperforming assets for the indicated periods 
december in thousands nonaccrual loans loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  and are still accruing interest restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans are designated as impaired when  in the opinion of management  the collection of principal and interest in accordance with the loan contract is doubtful 
at december   impaired loans were million  which was an increase of million or from the million in impaired loans at december  this slight increase in impaired loans was due mainly to increased impairments associated with loans in the company s commercial and real estate construction and development portfolios primarily as a result of the current economic conditions 
based on current information and events  united believes it is probable that the borrowers will not be able to repay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements 
the loss potential on these loans has been properly evaluated and allocated within the company s allowance for loan losses 
for further details on impaired loans  see note c  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united maintains an allowance for loan losses and an allowance for lending related commitments 
the combined allowances for loan losses and lending related commitments are referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was million as compared to million at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million as compared to million at december  as a percentage of loans  net of unearned income  the allowance for loan losses was at december  and of loans  net of unearned income at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans or coverage ratio was and at december  and december   respectively 
the coverage ratio for united s federal reserve peer group was at september  for united  this ratio decreased as a result of an million or increase in nonperforming loans during the year of adjustments to risk grades and qualitative risk factors within the allowance for loan loss analysis were based on delinquency and loss trends of such loans and resulted in increased allowance allocations of million or 
however  this increase was not to the same degree as the overall increase in nonperforming loans 
the company s detailed methodology and analysis did not indicate a corresponding increase in the allowance for loan losses primarily because of the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral of loans considered impaired 

table of contents for the years ended december  and  the provision for credit losses was million and million  respectively 
net charge offs were million for the year of as compared to net charge offs of million for the year of the increase in the provision for credit losses for the year of was due mainly to the previously mentioned provision of million for loans with fraudulent collateral made to three affiliated companies of a commercial customer as well as a continued decline in credit quality in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were for the year of which compares favorably to united s most recently reported federal reserve peer group banking companies net charge offs to average loans percentage was for the first nine months of the following table summarizes united s credit loss experience for each of the five years ended december dollars in thousands balance of allowance for credit losses at beginning of year allowance of purchased company at date of acquisition loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate real estate construction consumer and other total charge offs recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate real estate construction consumer and other total recoveries net loans charged off provision for credit losses balance of allowance for credit losses at end of year loans outstanding at the end of period gross  continuing operations average loans outstanding during period net of unearned income net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding allowance for credit losses  continuing operations as a percentage of nonperforming loans excludes loans held for sale 
united evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and its loan administration policies are focused upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
united s process for evaluating the allowance is a formal company wide process that focuses on early identification of potential problem credits and procedural discipline in managing and accounting for those credits 
this process determines the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses  allocation among loan types and lending related commitments  and the resulting provision for credit losses 

table of contents allocations are made for specific commercial loans based upon management s estimate of the borrowers ability to repay and other factors impacting collectibility 
other commercial loans not specifically reviewed on an individual basis are evaluated based on historical loss percentages applied to loan pools that have been segregated by risk 
allocations for loans other than commercial loans are made based upon historical loss experience adjusted for current environmental conditions 
the allowance for credit losses includes estimated probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet fully manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  a portion of the allowance accounts for the inherent imprecision in the allowance for credit losses analysis 
the following table presents the allocation of united s allowance for credit losses for each of the five years ended december in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate real estate construction consumer and other lending related commitments allowance for estimated imprecision total the following is a summary of loans outstanding as a percent of total loans at december commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer total united s formal company wide review of the allowance for loan losses at december  produced increased allocations in three of the four loan categories 
the components of the allowance allocated to commercial loans increased by million due to the impact of downward risk grade migration  increasing delinquency and loss trends that resulted in higher loss rates being applied to loan pool subsets within the portfolio 
real estate loan pool allocations increased million also as a result of increases in historical loss rates and to recognize the loss inherent with respect to declining market values and its effect upon residential exposure in selected markets within united s washington  dc metropolitan area shenandoah valley footprint 
the real estate construction loan pool allocations increased million in comparison with the december  year end primarily due to increased historical loss rates and a million increase in specific allocations for impaired loans offset somewhat by lower outstanding loan balances 
the components of the allowance allocated to consumer loans decreased by million due to the refinement of the methodology related to the allocation for overdraft losses as the credit quality of the consumer loan portfolio has remained consistent with the prior year 
the allowance for lending related commitments at december  was relatively flat from december   increasing by only thousand 
an allowance is established for probable credit losses on impaired loans via specific allocations 
nonperforming commercial loans and leases are regularly reviewed to identify impairment 
a loan or lease is impaired when  based on current 
table of contents information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts contractually due 
measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates  and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates 
impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan s effective rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the selected measure is less than the recorded investment in the loan  an impairment has occurred 
the allowance for impaired loans was million at december  and million at december  compared to the prior year end  this element of the allowance increased by million primarily due to increased real estate construction and development loan pool specific allocations 
an allowance is also recognized for imprecision inherent in loan loss migration models and other estimates of loss 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending related commitments  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its methodology for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors to identify and quantify probable losses in the portfolio  the process includes subjective elements and is therefore susceptible to change 
this estimate for imprecision has been established to recognize the variance  within a reasonable margin  of the loss estimation process 
the estimate for imprecision decreased at december  by million to million 
this represents of the company s total allowance for credit losses and in as much as this variance approximates a pre determined narrow parameter  the methodology has confirmed that the company s allowance for credit losses is at an appropriate level 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses on existing loans and lending related commitments based on information currently available 
united s loan administration policies are focused on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio in terms of loan approval and credit quality 
the commercial loan portfolio is monitored for possible concentrations of credit in one or more industries 
management has lending limits as a percentage of capital per type of credit concentration in an effort to ensure adequate diversification within the portfolio 
most of united s commercial loans are secured by real estate located in west virginia  southeastern ohio  virginia and maryland and the district of columbia 
it is the opinion of management that these commercial loans do not pose any unusual risks and that adequate consideration has been given to these loans in establishing the allowance for credit losses 
management is not aware of any potential problem loans  trends or uncertainties  which it reasonably expects  will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources which have not been disclosed 
additionally  management has disclosed all known material credits  which cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment schedules 
other income other income consists of all revenues  which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets 
noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving united s profitability 
recognizing the importance  management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced 
noninterest income was million for the year of  down million or from the year of included in noninterest income for the year of were noncash  before tax  other than temporary impairment charges of million on investment securities including an million on a single issue trust preferred security  million on a certain trup cdo and thousand on one security carried at cost 
noninterest income for the year of was million which included noncash  before tax other than temporary impairment charges on investment securities totaling million and a thousand gain related to visa s initial public offering and the partial redemption of visa shares held by united 
the noncash  before tax  other than temporary impairment charges of million consisted mainly of charges of million on a corporate debt holding and thousand on certain marketable equity securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for more than six months 
excluding the results of the investment security transactions  noninterest income for the year of would have decreased million or from the year of revenue from trust income and brokerage commissions decreased million or due to a decrease in the value of the trust assets under management 
united continues its efforts to broaden the scope and activity of its trust and brokerage 
table of contents service areas  especially in the northern virginia market  to provide additional sources of fee income that complement united s traditional banking products and services 
the northern virginia market provides a relatively large number of potential customers with high per capita incomes 
fees from deposit services were million for the year of  an increase of million or as compared to the year of due mainly to the high performance checking program 
in particular  check card fees increased thousand  insufficient funds nsf fees increased thousand and account analysis fees increased thousand during the year of for the year  income from bank owned life insurance policies decreased thousand or due mainly to a decrease in cash surrender values while fees from bankcard transactions decreased million or compared to the year of due to a lower volume of spending by consumers as a result of the current economic conditions 
mortgage banking income increased thousand or due to increased mortgage loan sales in the secondary market during the year of as compared to mortgage loan sales were million in as compared to million in other income decreased million or for the year of as compared to last year s income 
this decrease in other income is due mainly to a decrease of million in the fair value of certain derivative financial instruments not in a hedging relationship with a similar amount of expense related to a decline in the fair value of derivative financial instruments included in other expense 
other expense just as management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced  it strives to improve the efficiency of its operations to reduce costs 
other expense includes all items of expense other than interest expense  the provision for credit losses and income tax expense 
noninterest expense for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of employee compensation for the year of decreased million or from the year of due largely to less commissions and incentives expense 
also included in employee compensation was expense for stock options of thousand for the year of as compared to thousand for the year of employee benefits expense increased million or 
specifically within employee benefits expense was an increase in pension expense of million due to a decline in the fair value of the plan assets 
united uses certain valuation methodologies to measure the fair value of the plan assets which are presented in note k  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the funded status of united s pension plan is based upon the fair value of the plan assets compared to the projected benefit obligation 
the determination of the projected benefit obligation and the associated periodic benefit expense involves significant judgment and estimation of future employee compensation levels  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
if united assumes a increase or decrease in the estimation of future employee compensation levels while keeping all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost associated with the pension plan would increase and decrease by approximately thousand and thousand  respectively 
if united assumes a increase or decrease in the discount rate while keeping all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost associated with the pension plan would decrease and increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
if united assumes a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets while keeping all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost associated with the pension plan would decrease and increase by approximately thousand 
net occupancy expense increased thousand or for the year of as compared to the year of the higher net occupancy expense for was due mainly to additional building rental expense and real property taxes 
equipment expense  including other real estate owned oreo costs  increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of the increase from was due mainly to an increase in losses from sales and deterioration in property values associated with oreo 
data processing expense increased thousand or for the year of as compared to the year of bankcard processing fees decreased million or due to decreased transactions as a result of less consumer spending for the year of as compared to last year 

table of contents fdic insurance expense increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of the increase was due mainly to the additional expense of million in the second quarter of for a special assessment by the fdic as well as higher premiums to increase the insurance fund for banks 
other expenses decreased million or for the year of as compared to the year of due mainly to a decrease of million in the fair value of certain derivative financial instruments not in a hedging relationship with a similar amount of income related to a decline in the fair value of derivative financial instruments included in other income 
in addition  several general operating expenses declined for the year of as compared to the previous year 
in particular  advertising expense decreased million  telephone expense decreased million and core deposit intangibles amortization decreased thousand 
united s efficiency ratio was for the year of which was comparable to for the year of income taxes for the year ended december   income taxes were million  compared to million for during the third quarter of  united reduced its income tax reserve for uncertainties by thousand as compared to a reduction of million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for examination of certain years 
during the first quarter of  united recorded a benefit associated with the reversal of an allowance for net operating loss carryforwards and a positive adjustment to income tax expense as a result of a concluded tax examination 
the total income tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of related to these two events was million 
as a result of these tax adjustments  united s effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for further details related to income taxes  see note j  notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of january   the state of west virginia changed its method of taxation to a unitary combined reporting of income for corporations taxable in west virginia 
a unitary business is defined as a commonly controlled group of businesses 
combined reporting is a tax reporting method where all of the members of a unitary group are required to determine their net income based on the activities of the unitary group as a whole 
the resulting impact to united will be an increase in state income tax expense of approximately to in the effective tax rate

tax equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of million or 
table of contents from the fourth quarter of this decrease in tax equivalent net interest income was primarily attributable to a decline in average earning assets of million or for the fourth quarter of average net loans declined million or for the fourth quarter of while average investments decreased million or due mainly to an increase in maturities and calls of securities from the fourth quarter of average short term investments did increase million as a result of united placing its excess cash in an interest bearing account with the federal reserve 
in addition  the average yield on earning assets declined basis points for the fourth quarter of as compared to the same quarter in partially offsetting these decreases to tax equivalent net interest income was a decrease of basis points in the fourth quarter of average cost of funds 
the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  down basis points from a net interest margin of for the fourth quarter of for the quarters ended december  and  the provision for credit losses was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for credit losses from the fourth quarter of was a result of an increase in the december  allowance for loan losses to account for further credit deterioration in the fourth quarter of net charge offs were million for the fourth quarter of as compared to million for the fourth quarter of noninterest income for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of million from the fourth quarter of included in noninterest income for the fourth quarter of and were the noncash  before tax  other than temporary impairment charges of million and million  respectively  on certain investment securities 
excluding the results of the noncash  before tax  other than temporary impairment charges as well as net gains and losses from sales and calls of investment securities  noninterest income would have decreased million or 
this decrease for the fourth quarter of was due primarily to a decrease in income from derivatives not in hedge relationships of million due to a change in fair value 
a similar amount of expense related to the change in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments is included in other expense in the income statement 
in addition  revenue from trust and brokerage services decreased thousand due mainly to a decrease in the value of the trust assets under management 
partially offsetting these declines were increases of thousand and thousand  respectively  in income from bank owned life insurance policies due to an increase in the cash surrender values and fees from deposit services due mainly to the high performance checking program 
noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of million or from the fourth quarter of due primarily to the decrease of million in expense from derivatives not in hedge relationships due to a change in fair value 
in addition  employee compensation declined thousand due to less commissions and incentives expense 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in employee benefits due to a million increase in expense associated with united s employee pension plan 
also  equipment expense  including other real estate owned oreo costs  increased thousand due mainly to increased losses from sales and declines in fair values of oreo properties while data processing expense increased thousand 
additional quarterly financial data for and may be found in note t  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of inflation united s income statements generally reflect the effects of inflation 
since interest rates  loan demand and deposit levels are impacted by inflation  the resulting changes in the interest sensitive assets and liabilities are included in net interest income 
similarly  operating expenses such as salaries  rents and maintenance include changing prices resulting from inflation 
one item that would not reflect inflationary changes is depreciation expense 
subsequent to the acquisition of depreciable assets  inflation causes price levels to rise  therefore  historically presented dollar values do not reflect this inflationary condition 
with inflation levels at relatively low levels and monetary and fiscal policies being implemented to keep the inflation rate increases within an acceptable range  management expects the impact of inflation would continue to be minimal in the near future 
the effect of regulatory policies and economic conditions united s business and earnings are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to 
table of contents influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
united s business and earnings are also affected by general and local economic conditions 
for most of and  certain credit markets experienced difficult conditions and volatility 
downturns in the credit market can cause a decline in the value of certain loans and securities  a reduction in liquidity and a tightening of credit 
a downturn in the credit market often signals a weakening economy that can cause job losses and thus distress on borrowers and their ability to repay loans 
uncertainties in credit markets and the economy present significant challenges for the financial services industry 
regulatory policies and economic conditions have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future  however  united cannot accurately predict the nature  timing or extent of any effect such policies or economic conditions may have on its future business and earnings 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet arrangements united has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 
the table below presents  by payment date  significant known contractual obligations to third parties as of december  total payments due by period in thousands total one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years deposits without a stated maturity time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings operating leases excludes interest 
includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
the interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon interest rates in effect at december  the interest to be paid on variable rate obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates  which materially affect the contractual obligation amounts to be paid 
excludes carrying value adjustments such as unamortized premiums or discounts 
as of december   united recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  of million 
this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that united has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  this estimated liability is excluded from the contractual obligations table 
united also enters into derivative contracts  mainly to protect against adverse interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities  under which it is required to either pay cash to or receive cash from counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value and not notional value on the consolidated balance sheet 
because the derivative contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  they are excluded from the preceding table 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note n  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
united s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for the loan 
table of contents commitments and standby letters of credit is the contractual or notional amount of those instruments 
united uses the same policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the following tables detail the amounts of significant commitments and letters of credit as of december  in thousands amount commitments to extend credit revolving open end secured by residential credit card and personal revolving lines commercial total unused commitments financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total letters of credit commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses  generally within one year  and may require the payment of a fee 
further discussion of commitments is included in note m  notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity in the opinion of management  united maintains liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and the credit needs of its customers 
like all banks  united depends upon its ability to renew maturing deposits and other liabilities on a daily basis and to acquire new funds in a variety of markets 
a significant source of funds available to united is core deposits 
core deposits include certain demand deposits  statement and special savings and now accounts 
these deposits are relatively stable and they are the lowest cost source of funds available to united 
short term borrowings have also been a significant source of funds 
these include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as well as advances from the fhlb 
repurchase agreements represent funds that are obtained as the result of a competitive bidding process 
liquid assets are cash and those items readily convertible to cash 
all banks must maintain sufficient balances of cash and near cash items to meet the day to day demands of customers and united s cash needs 
other than cash and due from banks  the available for sale securities portfolio and maturing loans are the primary sources of liquidity 
the goal of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding that enables united to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and meet united s cash needs 
liquidity is managed by monitoring funds availability from a number of primary sources 
substantial funding is available from cash and cash equivalents  unused short term borrowings  and a geographically dispersed network of branches providing access to a diversified and substantial retail deposit market 
short term needs can be met through a wide array of outside sources such as correspondent and downstream correspondent federal funds and utilization of federal home loan bank advances 
other sources of liquidity available to united to provide long term as well as short term funding alternatives  in addition to fhlb advances  are long term certificates of deposit  lines of credit  borrowings that are secured by bank premises or stock of united s subsidiaries and issuances of trust preferred securities 
in the normal course of business  united through its asset liability committee evaluates these as well as other alternative funding strategies that may be utilized to meet short term and long term funding needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of united s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within united s policy guidelines 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposures due to changes in economic conditions  interest rate levels and customer preferences 
interest rate risk management considers interest rate risk to be united s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in united s net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
united s earnings are largely dependent on the effective management of interest rate risk 

table of contents management of interest rate risk focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits 
united s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk to maintain an acceptable level of change to net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
policy established for interest rate risk is stated in terms of the change in net interest income over a one year and two year horizon given an immediate and sustained increase or decrease in interest rates 
the current limits approved by the board of directors are structured on a staged basis with each stage requiring specific actions 
united employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its exposure to changing interest rates 
one such technique utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes executive management projections for activity levels in product lines offered by united 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
rate scenarios could involve parallel or nonparallel shifts in the yield curve  depending on historical  current  and expected conditions  as well as the need to capture any material effects of explicit or embedded options 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management s strategies 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as those assets or liabilities that mature or are repriced within a designated time frame 
the principal function of managing interest rate risk is to maintain an appropriate relationship between those assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changing market interest rates 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for specified periods of time is known as the gap 
earnings simulation analysis captures not only the potential of these interest sensitive assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
moreover  earnings simulation analysis considers the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet items and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
united closely monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities on an on going basis and projects the effect of various interest rate changes on its net interest margin 
the following table shows united s estimated consolidated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  and change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income december  december  given an immediate  sustained basis point upward shock to the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated that net interest income for united would increase by over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of as of december  a basis point immediate  sustained upward shock in the yield curve would increase net interest income by an estimated over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of as of december  a basis point immediate  sustained downward shock in the yield curve would increase net interest income by an estimated over one year as of december  as compared to a decrease of over one year as of december  with the federal funds rate at at december  and  management believed a basis point immediate  sustained decline in rates was highly unlikely 
this analysis does not include the potential increased refinancing activities  which should lessen the negative impact on net income from falling rates 
while it is unlikely market rates would immediately move or basis points upward or downward on a sustained basis  this is another tool used by management and the board of directors to gauge interest rate risk 
all of these estimated changes in net interest income are and were within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 

table of contents to further aid in interest rate management  united s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the use of fhlb advances provides united with a low risk means of matching maturities of earning assets and interest bearing funds to achieve a desired interest rate spread over the life of the earning assets 
in addition  united uses credit with large regional banks and trust preferred securities to provide funding 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  united may use derivative instruments to protect against adverse price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities and on future cash flows 
these derivatives commonly consist of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  collars  futures  forward contracts  written and purchased options 
interest rate swaps obligate two parties to exchange one or more payments generally calculated with reference to a fixed or variable rate of interest applied to the notional amount 
united accounts for its derivative activities in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
extension risk a key feature of most mortgage loans is the ability of the borrower to repay principal earlier than scheduled 
this is called a prepayment 
prepayments arise primarily due to sale of the underlying property  refinancing  or foreclosure 
in general  declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments  and rising interest rates tend to slow prepayments 
like other fixed income securities  when interest rates rise  the value of mortgage related securities generally decline 
the rate of prepayments on underlying mortgages will affect the price and volatility of mortgage related securities and may shorten or extend the effective maturity of the security beyond what was anticipated at the time of purchase 
if interest rates rise  united s holdings of mortgage related securities may experience reduced returns if the borrowers of the underlying mortgages pay off their mortgages later than anticipated 
this is generally referred to as extension risk 
at december   united s mortgage related securities portfolio had an amortized cost of million  of which approximately million or were fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
these fixed rate cmos consisted primarily of planned amortization class pacs  sequential pay and accretion directed vadms bonds having an average life of approximately years and a weighted average yield of  under current projected prepayment assumptions 
these securities are expected to have very little extension risk in a rising rate environment 
current models show that an immediate  sustained upward shock of basis points  the average life of these securities would only extend to years 
the projected price decline of the fixed rate cmo portfolio in rates up basis points would be  less than the price decline of a year treasury note 
by comparison  the price decline of a year current coupon mortgage backed security mbs in rates higher by basis points would be approximately 
united had approximately million in year mortgage backed securities with a projected yield of and a projected average life of years as of december  this portfolio consisted of seasoned year mortgage paper with a weighted average loan age of years and a weighted average maturity of years 
united had approximately million in year mortgage backed securities with a projected yield of and a projected average life of years on december  this portfolio consisted of seasoned year mortgage paper with a weighted average loan age of years and a weighted average maturity of years
