item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation included in this annual report 

table of contents our sales estimates for future periods are based on estimated end user demand for our products 
sales to our distribution partners would fall short of expectations if distributor inventories increase because of less than estimated end user consumption 
other factors that are beyond our control and that could affect our operating results in the future include seasonal fluctuations in our sales of infectious disease tests  which are generally highest in fall and winter  thus resulting in generally lower operating results in the second calendar quarter and higher operating results in the first  third and fourth calendar quarters  timing of the onset  length and severity of the cold and flu seasons  government and media attention focused on influenza and the related potential impact on humans from novel influenza viruses  including hn and avian flu  changes in the level of competition  such as would occur if one of our larger and better financed competitors introduced a new or lower priced product to compete with one of our products  changes in the reimbursement systems or reimbursement amounts that end users rely upon in choosing to use our products  changes in economic conditions in our domestic and international markets  such as economic downturns  decreased healthcare spending  reduced consumer demand  inflation and currency fluctuations  changes in sales levels  since a significant portion of our costs are fixed costs with the result that relatively higher sales could likely increase profitability but relatively lower sales would not reduce costs by the same proportion  and hence could cause operating losses  lower than anticipated market penetration of our new or more recently introduced products  significant quantities of our product in our distributors inventories or distribution channels  and changes in distributor buying patterns 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop or obtain proprietary technology rights  otherwise  other companies may increase their market share by selling technologically superior products that compete with our products 
our competitive position is heavily dependent on obtaining and protecting our own proprietary technology or obtaining licenses from others 
our ability to compete successfully in the diagnostic market depends on continued development and introduction of new proprietary technology and the improvement of existing technology 
if we cannot continue to develop  obtain and protect proprietary technology  our total revenue and gross profits could be adversely affected 
moreover  our current and future licenses may not be adequate for the operation of our business 
our ability to obtain patents and licenses  and their benefits  is uncertain 
we have issued patents both in the us and internationally  with expiration dates ranging from the present through approximately additionally  we have patent applications pending throughout the world 
these pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  or if issued  may not have priority over others applications or may not offer protection against competitors with similar technology 
moreover  any patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition to the us  we have patents issued in various other countries including  for example  australia  canada  japan and various european countries including france  germany  italy  spain and the united kingdom 
third parties can make  use and sell products covered by our patents in any country in which we do not have patent protection 
we also license the right to use our products to our customers under label licenses that are for research purposes only 
these licenses could be contested and  because we cannot monitor all potential unauthorized uses of our products around the world  we might not be aware of an unauthorized use and might not be able to enforce the license restrictions in a cost effective manner 
also  we may not be able to obtain licenses for technology patented by others and required to produce our products on commercially reasonable terms 

table of contents in order to remain competitive and profitable  we must expend considerable resources to research new technologies and products and develop new markets 
our failure to successfully introduce new technologies and products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we devote a significant amount of financial resources to researching and developing new technologies  new products and new markets 
the development  manufacture and sale of diagnostic products require a significant investment of resources 
moreover  no assurances can be given that our efforts to develop new technologies or products will be successful or commercially viable 
the development of new markets also requires a substantial investment of resources  such as new employees  offices and manufacturing facilities 
accordingly  we are likely to incur increased operating expenses as a result of our increased investment in sales and marketing activities  manufacturing scale up and new product development associated with our efforts to accomplish our business strategy discussed in item of this annual report 
as a result of any number of risk factors identified in this annual report  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our operational  growth and other strategic efforts 
in addition  the funds for our strategic development projects have in the past come primarily from our business operations and a working capital line of credit 
if our business slows and we become less profitable  and as a result have less money available to fund research and development  we will have to decide at that time which programs to reduce  and by how much 
similarly  if adequate financial  personnel  equipment or other resources are not available  we may be required to delay or scale back our strategic efforts 
our operations will be adversely affected if our total revenue and gross profits do not correspondingly increase or if our technology  product and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed 
furthermore  our failure to successfully introduce new products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we rely on a limited number of key distributors which account for a substantial majority of our total revenue 
the loss of any key distributor or an unsuccessful effort to directly distribute our products could lead to reduced sales 
although we have many distributor relationships in the us  the market is dominated by a small group of these distributors 
four of our distributors  which are considered to be among the market leaders  collectively accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we had sales to four separate distributors for whom sales to each exceeded of total revenue for the year ended december  these distributors were cardinal  pss  mckesson and fisher 
in addition  we rely on a few key distributors for a majority of our international sales  and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
the loss or termination of our relationship with any of these key distributors could significantly disrupt our business unless suitable alternatives were timely found or lost sales to one distributor are absorbed by another distributor 
finding a suitable alternative may pose challenges in our industry s competitive environment  and another suitable distributor may not be found on satisfactory terms 
for instance  some distributors already have exclusive arrangements with our competitors  and others do not have the same level of penetration into our target markets as our existing distributors 
if total revenue to these or any of our other significant distributors were to decrease in any material amount in the future or we are not successful in timely transitioning business to new distributors  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our operating results are heavily dependent on sales of our influenza diagnostic tests 
revenues from the sale of our influenza tests represent a significant portion of our total revenues and are expected to remain so in at least the near future 
in addition  the gross margins derived from sales of our influenza tests are significantly higher than the gross margins from our other core products 
as a result  if sales of our influenza tests decline for any reason whether as a result of market share loss or price pressure  obsolescence  a mild flu season  regulatory matters or any other reason our operating results would be materially and adversely affected on a disproportionate basis 
if we are not able to manage our growth strategy or if we experience difficulties integrating companies or technologies we may acquire after the acquisition  our earnings may be adversely affected 
our business strategy contemplates further growth in the scope of operating and financial systems and the geographical area of our operations  including further expansion outside the us  as new products are developed and commercialized or new geographical markets are entered 
as discussed elsewhere  we acquired dhi on february  we may experience difficulties integrating the operations of dhi and other companies or technologies that we may acquire with our own operations  and as a result we may not realize our anticipated benefits and cost savings within our expected time frame  or at all 
because we have a relatively small executive staff  future growth may also divert management s 
table of contents attention from other aspects of our business  and will place a strain on existing management and our operational  financial and management information systems 
furthermore  we may expand into markets in which we have less experience or incur higher costs 
should we encounter difficulties in managing these tasks  our growth strategy may suffer and our total revenue and gross profits could be adversely affected 
intellectual property risks and third party claims of infringement  misappropriation of proprietary rights or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties  and materially adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the attention of our management and other key employees 
companies in or related to our industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
there are often intellectual property risks associated with developing and producing new products and entering new markets  and we may not be able to obtain  at reasonable cost and upon commercially reasonable terms  licenses to intellectual property of others that is alleged to be part of such new or existing products 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
moreover  in the past we have been engaged in litigation with parties that claim  among other matters  that we infringed their patents 
we or our customers may be sued by other parties that claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated their proprietary rights or which may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
an adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products  limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved with such products may perform for us  increase our costs of revenue and expose us to significant liability 
as a general matter  our involvement in litigation or in any claims to determine proprietary rights  as may arise from time to time  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations for reasons such as pending litigation may of itself cause our distributors or end users to reduce purchases of our products  it may consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources  its outcome would be uncertain and a court may find any third party patent claims valid and infringed by our products issuing a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall such products from the market  redesign such products offered for sale or under development or restrict employees from performing work in their areas of expertise  governmental agencies may commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees  former employees and us relating to claims of misappropriation or misuse of another party s proprietary rights  an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability in the form of past royalty payments  penalties  special and punitive damages and future royalty payments significantly affecting our future earnings  and failure to obtain a necessary license upon commercially reasonable terms  if at all upon an adverse outcome could prevent us from selling our current products or other products we may develop 
in addition to the foregoing  we may also indemnify some customers  distributors and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
further  our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors  suppliers or customers 
we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
our contractors  suppliers and licensors may not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us  or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount  above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages 

table of contents volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  as well as our ability to access credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 
during  the global capital and credit markets experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval  characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these conditions could adversely affect the demand for our products and services and  therefore  reduce purchases by our customers  which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations  financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may limit our access to capital  and may also negatively affect our customers and our suppliers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses 
as a result  our customers needs and ability to purchase our products or services may decrease  and our suppliers may increase their prices  reduce their output or change their terms of sale 
if our customers or suppliers operating and financial performance deteriorates  or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit  our customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable owed to us  and our suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms 
any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services  or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms  may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
additionally  both state and federal government sponsored payers  as a result of budget deficits or reductions  may seek to reduce their health care expenditures by renegotiating their contracts with us 
any reduction in payments by such government sponsored payers may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
declining economic conditions may also increase our costs 
if economic conditions remain volatile  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may not achieve market acceptance of our products among physicians and other healthcare providers  and this would have a negative effect on future sales growth 
a large part of our business is based on the sale of rapid poc diagnostic tests that physicians and other healthcare providers can administer in their own facilities without sending samples to central laboratories 
clinical reference laboratories and hospital based laboratories are significant competitors of ours in connection with these rapid poc diagnostic tests and provide a majority of the diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers 
our future sales depend on  among other matters  capture of sales from these laboratories by achieving market acceptance of poc testing from physicians and other healthcare providers 
if we do not capture sales at the levels we have budgeted for  our total revenue will not grow as much as we hope and the costs we have incurred will be disproportionate to our sales levels 
we expect that clinical reference and hospital based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our poc diagnostic products in order to maintain and expand their existing dominance of the overall diagnostic testing market 
moreover  even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective or save time  physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing to poc tests 
our failure to achieve market acceptance from physicians and healthcare providers with respect to the use of our poc diagnostic products would have a negative effect on our future sales growth 
intense competition with other providers of poc diagnostic products may reduce our sales 
in addition to competition from laboratories  our poc diagnostic tests compete with similar products made by our competitors 
there are a large number of multinational and regional competitors making investments in competing technologies and products  including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies 
we also face competition from our distributors since some have created  and others may decide to create  their own products to compete with ours 
a number of our competitors have a potential competitive advantage because they have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources  and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we have 
these competitors include  among others  ima  beckman  fisher  genzyme and becton 
moreover  some competitors offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we have 
if our competitors products are more effective than ours or acquire market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing  our total revenue and profits could be materially and adversely affected 
competition also has the effect of limiting the prices we can charge for our products 
our products are highly regulated by various governmental agencies 
any changes to the existing laws and regulations may adversely impact our ability to manufacture and market our products 
the testing  manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
the fda regulates most of our products  which are currently all class i or ii devices 
the us department of agriculture regulates our veterinary products 
our future performance depends on  among other matters  our estimates as to when and at what cost we will receive regulatory approval for new products 
in addition  certain of our foreign product registrations are owned or controlled by our international distribution partners that could result in the loss of or delay in transfer of any such product registrations  thereby 
table of contents interrupting our ability to sell our products in those markets 
regulatory approval can be a lengthy  expensive and uncertain process  making the timing and costs of approvals difficult to predict 
our total revenue would be negatively affected by failures or delays in the receipt of approvals or clearances  the loss of previously received approvals or clearances or the placement of limits on the marketing and use of our products 
furthermore  in the ordinary course of business  we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
if regulators subsequently disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with these regulations  we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties  as well as product recall  seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products 
the assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to numerous government regulations in addition to fda regulation  and compliance with changes could increase our costs 
in addition to fda and other regulations described previously  numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances impact our business operations 
if these laws change or laws regulating any of our businesses are added  the costs of compliance with these laws could substantially increase our costs 
failure to comply with any future modifications of these laws or laws regulating the manufacture and marketing of our products could result in substantial costs and loss of sales or customers 
because of the number and extent of the laws and regulations affecting our industry  and the number of governmental agencies whose actions could affect our operations  it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of future legislation or regulatory developments relating to our industry 
to the extent the costs and procedures associated with meeting new requirements are substantial  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we use hazardous materials in our business that may result in unexpected and substantial claims against us relating to handling  storage or disposal 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
these regulations include federal statutes popularly known as cercla  rcra and the clean water act 
compliance with these laws and regulations is already expensive 
if any governmental authorities were to impose new environmental regulations requiring compliance in addition to that required by existing regulations  these future environmental regulations could impair our research  development or production efforts by imposing additional  and possibly substantial  costs on our business 
in addition  because of the nature of the penalties provided for in some of these environmental regulations  we could be required to pay sizeable fines  penalties or damages in the event of noncompliance with environmental laws 
any environmental violation or remediation requirement could also partially or completely shut down our research and manufacturing facilities and operations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated and exposure of individuals to these materials could result in substantial fines  penalties or damages that are not covered by insurance 
our total revenue could be affected by third party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints 
the end users of our products are primarily physicians and other healthcare providers 
use of our products would be adversely impacted if physicians do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products by their patients healthcare insurers or payers 
our total revenue could also be adversely affected by changes or trends in reimbursement policies of these governmental or private healthcare payers 
in the us  healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third party payers  principally private health insurance plans  federal medicare and state medicaid  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure 
we believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to  and will continue to lead to  increased pressures on the healthcare industry  both foreign and domestic  to reduce the cost of products and services 
given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the us in recent years  currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development 
third party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the us or foreign markets  current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payers may reduce the demand for our products or adversely impact our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 

table of contents unexpected increases in  or inability to meet  current demand for our products could require us to spend considerable resources to meet the demand or harm our customer relationships if we are unable to meet demand 
our inability to meet customer demand for our products  whether as a result of manufacturing problems or supply shortfalls  could harm our customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry 
this  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we experience unexpected increases in the demand for our products  we may be required to expend additional capital resources to meet these demands 
these capital resources could involve the cost of new machinery or even the cost of new manufacturing facilities 
this would increase our capital costs  which could adversely affect our earnings and cash resources 
if we are unable to develop necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner  our total revenue could be adversely affected 
failure to cost effectively increase production volumes  if required  or lower than anticipated yields or production problems encountered as a result of changes that we may make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand or changes in applicable laws and regulations  could result in shipment delays as well as increased manufacturing costs  which could also have a material adverse effect on our total revenue and profitability 
unexpected increases in demand for our products could also require us to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the demand 
some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and some are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
we have long term supply agreements with many of these suppliers  but these long term agreements involve risks for us  such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials and components and our reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery 
it is also possible that one or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials to us 
any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and components  and our inability to quickly and cost effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply  could have a material adverse effect on our total revenue or cost of sales and related profits 
if one or more of our products proves to be defective  we could be subject to claims of liability that could adversely affect our business 
a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injuries and otherwise 
any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim would have a material adverse effect on our profitability and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are exposed to business risk which  if not covered by insurance  could have an adverse effect on our profits 
claims may be made against us for types of damages  or for amounts of damages  that are not covered by our insurance 
for example  although we currently carry product liability insurance for liability losses  there is a risk that product liability or other claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policy 
also  if we are held liable  our existing insurance may not be renewed at the same cost and level of coverage as currently in effect  or may not be renewed at all 
further  we do not currently have insurance against many environmental risks we confront in our business 
if we are held liable for a claim against which we are not insured or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage  whether arising out of product liability matters or from some other matter  that claim could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability 
our business could be negatively affected by the loss of or the inability to hire key personnel 
our future success depends in part on our ability to retain our key technical  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify and hire additional qualified personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  both in the industry in which we operate and also in santa clara and san diego  where our headquarters and the majority of our operations are located 
further  we expect to grow our operations  and our needs for additional management and other key personnel are expected to increase 
if we are not able to retain existing key personnel  or identify and hire additional qualified personnel to meet expected growth  our business could be adversely impacted 
we face risks relating to our international sales  including inherent economic  political and regulatory risks  which could increase our costs  cause interruptions in our current business operations and stifle our growth opportunities 
our products are sold internationally  with the majority of our international sales to our customers in japan  europe and the middle east 
we currently sell and market our products by channeling products through distributor organizations and sales agents 
sales to foreign customers accounted for   and of our total revenue for the years ended 
table of contents december   and  respectively 
our international sales are subject to inherent economic  political and regulatory risks  which could increase our operating costs  cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our international growth 
these foreign risks include  among others compliance with new and changing registration requirements  our inability to benefit from registration for our products inasmuch as registrations may be controlled by a distributor  the difficulty in the transitioning of our product registrations  and tariffs or other barriers as we continue to expand into new countries and geographic regions  exposure to currency exchange fluctuations against the us dollar  longer payment cycles  generally lower average selling prices and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  reduced protection for  and enforcement of  intellectual property rights  political and economic instability in some of the regions where we currently sell our products or that we may expand into in the future  potentially adverse tax consequences  and diversion of our products to the us from products sold into international markets at lower prices 
currently  all of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in us dollars 
nonetheless  these sales are subject to currency risks  since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
these exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products  as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
in order to maintain a competitive price for our products internationally  we may have to continue to provide discounts or otherwise effectively reduce our prices  resulting in a lower margin on products sold internationally 
continued change in the values of the euro  the japanese yen and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently hedge against exchange rate fluctuations  which means that we are fully exposed to exchange rate changes 
investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if we or our independent registered public accounting firm conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring us  as a public company  to include a report of management on our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
how companies are implementing these requirements  including internal control reforms  if any  to comply with section s requirements  and how independent registered public accounting firms are applying these requirements and testing companies internal controls  remain subject to uncertainty 
the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of are ongoing 
we expect that our internal controls will continue to evolve as our business activities change 
although we seek to diligently and vigorously review our internal controls over financial reporting in an effort to ensure compliance with the section requirements  any control system  regardless of how well designed  operated and evaluated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that its objectives will be met 
if  during any year  our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated  tested or assessed  or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements  rules or regulations differently than we do  then it may issue a report that is qualified 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and effectiveness of our internal controls  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 

table of contents risks related to our common stock our stock price has been highly volatile  and an investment in our stock could suffer a significant decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated substantially in the past 
for example  as of the end of each quarter period between december  and december   the closing price of our common stock  as reported by the nasdaq global market  has ranged from a low of to a high of 
we expect our common stock to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the risk factors discussed above 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that  at times  have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the relevant companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
future sales by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock 
sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
as of december  approximately million shares of our common stock had been issued in registered offerings and million are generally tradable in the public markets without restrictions  and approximately million shares of our common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options under our various equity incentive plans at a weighted average exercise price of 
we are unable to estimate the number of shares of our common stock that may actually be resold in the public market since this will depend on the market price for our common stock  the individual circumstances of the sellers and other factors 
we also have a number of institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our common stock 
if one or more of these stockholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time  for liquidity or other reasons  the prevailing market price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
anti takeover devices may prevent a sale  or changes in the management  of the company 
we have in place several anti takeover devices  including a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a sale  or changes in the management  of the company 
for example  our bylaws require stockholders to give written notice of any proposal or director nomination to us within a specified period of time prior to any stockholder meeting 
we may also issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and on terms that our board of directors may determine in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock  and the holders of such preferred stock could have voting  dividend  liquidation and other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock 
we do not pay dividends and this may negatively affect the price of our stock 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the future price of our common stock may be adversely impacted because we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends

overview and executive summary we have a leadership position in the development  manufacturing and marketing of diagnostic testing solutions 
these diagnostic testing solutions primarily include applications in infectious diseases and reproductive and women s health 
we sell our products directly to end users and distributors  in each case  for professional use in physician offices  hospitals  clinical laboratories  reference laboratories  leading universities  retail clinics and wellness screening centers 
we market our products in the us through a network of national and regional distributors  and a direct sales force 
internationally  we sell and market primarily in japan  europe and the middle east through exclusive distributor arrangements 
a majority of our total revenues relate to three product families 
for the years ended december   and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales of our influenza  group a strep and pregnancy tests 
additionally  a significant portion of our total revenue is from a relatively small number of distributors 
approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  were related to sales through our four largest distributors 
our net revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was largely driven by increased global sales of our influenza products 
our primary objective is to expand our leadership position in the markets we serve 
our diagnostic testing solutions are designed to provide specialized results that serve various customer needs  including reduction of cost  increased test accuracy  and reduced time to result  thus creating a diagnostic continuum in the in vitro diagnostic market 
this diagnostic continuum relative to our strategy is comprised of three parts lateral flow immunoassay tests  direct fluorescent assays dfa and culture based tests  and molecular diagnostic tests 
the critical elements required to accomplish our primary objective include the following continue to focus our research and development efforts on three areas new proprietary product platform development  the creation of improved products and new products for existing markets and unmet clinical needs  and pursuit of collaborations with other companies for new and existing products and markets that advance our differentiated strategy  provide clinicians with validated studies that encompass the clinical efficacy and economic efficiency of our diagnostic tests for the professional market  continue to focus on strengthening our market and brand leadership in infectious diseases and reproductive and women s health by acquiring  developing and introducing clinically superior diagnostic solutions  drive growth by strengthening our direct sales force to assure physician and laboratorian satisfaction through direct relationships with integrated delivery networks  laboratories and hospitals  support payer evaluation of diagnostic tests and establishment of favorable reimbursement rates  continue creation of strong global alliances to assure leadership in key markets and expand our presence in emerging markets  and drive profit through further refinement of our manufacturing efficiencies and productivity improvements  with continued focus on profitable products and markets and our effort to create exceptional competency in new product development 
as a business in a highly regulated and competitive industry  we face many risks and challenges and we also have opportunities 
there are many economic and industry factors that affect our business  some of the more important factors are outlined below sales of our infectious disease products  which have collectively accounted for approximately  and of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  are subject to and significantly affected by the seasonal demands of the cold and flu seasons  sales of our products can be affected significantly by many competitive factors  including convenience  price and product performance as well as the distribution  advertising  promotion and brand name recognition of the marketer  intellectual property protection of our products is crucial to our business  the testing  manufacture and commercialization of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies  the production processes for point of care poc tests are complex  highly regulated and vary widely from product to product  and there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets over the last several years 
you should also refer to the discussion in item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report for further discussion of risks related to our business 

table of contents recent developments on february   we acquired diagnostic hybrids  inc dhi a privately held  in vitro diagnostics ivd company  based in athens  ohio  that is a market leader in the manufacturing and commercialization of fda cleared direct fluorescent ivd assays used in hospital and reference laboratories for a variety of diseases  including viral respiratory infections  herpes  chlamydia and other viral infections  and thyroid diseases 
dhi reported revenues of approximately million and million in net income for their fiscal year dhi s direct sales force serves over north american customers  and its products are sold via distributors outside the united states 
their products are offered under various brand names including  elvis  r mix  mixed fresh cells  freshcells  readycells and thyretain 
we paid approximately million in cash to acquire dhi 
outlook we do not plan for or expect the influenza pandemic of to recur in accordingly  we expect a significant decrease in our influenza test sales  related earnings and cash flows during additionally  we anticipate gross margins will trend lower for the upcoming year as a result of the product mix shift from s high level of influenza sales 
nonetheless  the acquisition of dhi builds upon and diversifies our revenue base and we expect the acquisition to lessen the effect of seasonality on our business quarter to quarter 
we will continue our focus on prudently managing our business and delivering solid financial results while at the same time continuing to introduce new products to the market and maintaining our emphasis on research and development investments for longer term growth 
finally  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new product lines and technologies  as well as  company acquisitions

we believe the increase in total revenue of our infectious disease products  for both our domestic and international markets  was largely driven by increased market penetration and increased utilization of our influenza test  while the decrease associated with our reproductive and women s health products was primarily driven by the timing of ordering patterns in the domestic market 
purchases by end users of our non seasonal products remained fairly constant for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the previous twelve months

the primary components of research and development expense are personnel and material costs associated with development of potential new technologies and processes and with products under development 
in addition  we continue to incur substantial costs related to clinical trials as well as our overall efforts under our qvb programs 
sales and marketing expense the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily related to an overall increase in sales personnel and related programs and expenses as well increased expenses associated with distribution events and trade shows  which support our leadership position and strategies to capitalize further on opportunities in poc diagnostics

cash provided by our operating activities was million for the year ended december  we had net income of million  including non cash charges of million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and property and equipment 
other changes in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to the timing of sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  an increase in accrued royalties of million due to the increase in revenue for fiscal year  and an increase in inventory of million primarily related to increased production in preparation for the upcoming flu season  which historically occurs in the first half of the year 
in addition  the increase in income taxes payable of million was primarily due to higher taxable earnings for compared to our investing activities used million during the year ended december   which was primarily for the acquisition of production and scientific equipment and building improvements 
we had investments in property  plant and equipment of million which had not been paid as of december  we are currently planning approximately million in capital expenditures over the next months

at december   we had no amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility and we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in connection with the acquisition of dhi  which closed on february   we borrowed million on our line of credit 
we also intend to continue to evaluate acquisition and technology licensing candidates 
as such  we may need to incur additional debt  or issue additional equity  to successfully complete these transactions 
cash requirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors  such as the extent to which we generate cash from operations  progress in research and development projects  competition and technological developments and the time and expenditures required to obtain governmental approval of our products 
based on our current cash position and the current assessment of future operating results  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet operating needs during the next months and the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations our facilities and certain equipment are leased under non cancelable operating leases 
our approximately  square foot san diego facility is subject to a financing arrangement with payments to december the following is a summary of our contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period less than more than total year years years years lease obligation operating lease obligations total reflects our lease obligation on the approximately  square foot san diego facility in place as of december  our future obligation under this financing arrangement is included in the table above 
reflects obligations on facilities and equipment under operating leases in place as of december  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to lease approximately  square feet of additional office space in san diego with a lease term to october in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a new operating lease at our santa clara location  including extending the term of the lease through future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
we have entered into various licensing agreements  which require royalty payments based on specified product sales 
these agreements  which have estimated expiration dates through early  encompass the majority of our products 
royalty expenses under these licensing agreements  which are charged to cost of sales  collectively totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe we will continue to incur substantial royalty expenses relating to future sales of our products 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues primarily from product sales 
these revenues are recorded net of rebates and other discounts which are estimated at the time of sale 
the rebates and other discounts are largely driven by various customer program offerings  including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
change in title to the product and recognition of revenue occur upon delivery to the customer when sales terms are free on board fob destination and at the time of shipment when the sales terms are fob shipping point and there is no right of return 
we also earn income from the licensing of technology 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee 
income earned from licensing activities is a component of total revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
stock based compensation compensation expense related to stock options granted is recognized ratably over the service vesting period for the entire option award 
the total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by estimated forfeiture rates 
the estimated fair value of each stock option was determined on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards stock awards is measured at the grant date and recognized ratably over the vesting period 
the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
a majority of the stock awards granted in were performance based and vesting was tied to achievement of predetermined revenue and or ebitda goals 
for purposes of measuring compensation expense  the amount of shares ultimately expected to vest is estimated at each reporting date based on management s expectations regarding the relevant performance criteria 
the recognition of compensation expense associated with performance based grants requires judgment in assessing the probability of meeting the performance goals  as well as defined criteria for assessing achievement of the performance related goals 
this may result in significant expense recognition or reversal in the period in which the performance goals are met or when achievement of the goals is deemed probable or may result in the reversal of previously recognized stock based compensation expense if the performance criteria are deemed not probable of being met 
the grant date of the performance based stock awards takes place when the grant is authorized and the specific achievement goals are communicated 
the communication date of the performance goals can impact the valuation and associated expense of the stock awards 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized approximately million in compensation expense associated with the performance based stock awards as the associated revenue and ebitda goals were met 
the computation of the expected option life is based on a weighted average calculation combining the average life of options that have already been exercised and post vest cancellations with the estimated life of the remaining vested and unexercised options 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the volatility of our stock has decreased in recent fiscal periods  and as a result in fiscal year  we changed our look back period in determining volatility to the third quarter of the risk free interest rate is based on the u 
s treasury yield curve over the expected term of the option 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
the estimated forfeiture rate is based on our historical experience and future expectations 

table of contents reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and adversely impact our reported results 
inventory our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand  we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and adversely impact net operating results in the future 
intangible assets intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
examples of such events or circumstances include the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  any volatility or significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of our assets  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we are required to perform periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  current tax assets and liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning opportunities 
to the extent that a determination is made to establish or adjust a valuation allowance  the expense or benefit is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the 
table of contents position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcome of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in accordance with this guidance which was adopted on january   we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of million  increasing the balance of retained earnings 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information on income taxes 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from excess tax benefits 
as of december  and  deferred tax assets do not include million and million  respectively  of these excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of our net operating loss carryforwards 
additional paid in capital would be increased up to million if such excess tax benefits are realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the fair market value of our floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december  and  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such dates 
our current investment policy with respect to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities focuses on maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity 
although we continually evaluate our placement of investments  as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were placed in certificates of deposit  commercial paper  money market or overnight funds that are highly liquid and which we believe are not subject to material market fluctuation risk 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in us dollars 
nonetheless  these sales are subject to currency risks  since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
these exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products  as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
continued change in the values of the euro  the japanese yen and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently hedge against exchange rate fluctuations  which means that we are fully exposed to exchange rate changes
