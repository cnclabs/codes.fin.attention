item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the caption risk factors in this report 
overview background we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the in licensing  development and commercialization of proprietary branded products and late stage product candidates for the treatment of diseases and disorders in the central nervous system therapeutic area 
on march   the fda notified us that it approved our nda for silenor mg and mg tablets for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance 
we have undertaken and continue to undertake activities to prepare for the commercial launch of silenor 
in addition  we continue to engage in discussions with third parties relating to the commercialization of silenor 
since our founding in  we have also entered into in license agreements for nalmefene and acamprosate 
in march  we and biotie therapies corp  or biotie  entered into an agreement to mutually terminate the license agreement 
pursuant to this agreement  biotie paid us a million termination fee 
in june  we exercised our contractual right to terminate our agreement with the university of miami for nalmefene for the treatment of nicotine dependence 
we have no further commitments under our nalmefene program 
with regards to acamprosate  we terminated the in license agreement effective january we have incurred significant losses since our inception in in december  we completed our initial public offering 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect our accumulated deficit to continue to increase for the next several years as we seek to commercialize silenor and potentially pursue development of other product candidates 
we will need to raise additional funds through strategic relationships  public or private equity or debt financings  assigning receivables or royalty rights  or other arrangements and cannot assure that the funding will be available on attractive terms  or at all 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise sufficient additional funds  we may be required to reduce or curtail our operations and costs  and we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
revenues as a development stage company  we have not generated any revenues to date  and we do not expect to generate any revenues from licensing  achievement of milestones or product sales until we enter into a strategic collaboration or are able to commercialize silenor ourselves 

table of contents license fees our license fees consist of the costs incurred to in license our product candidates 
we expense all license fees and milestone payments for acquired development and commercialization rights to operations as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future use at this time 
in march  we entered into an agreement with biotie to mutually terminate our license for nalmefene for the treatment of impulse control and substance abuse disorders 
pursuant to the termination agreement  biotie paid us a million termination fee which we included as an offset to our license fees 
in june  we exercised our contractual right to terminate our agreement with the university of miami for nalmefene for the treatment of nicotine dependence 
we have no further commitments under our nalmefene program 
research and development expenses we expense all research and development costs to operations as incurred 
to date  our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our clinical trials managed by our cros  our non clinical development program for silenor and submitting and seeking approval of our nda for silenor  regulatory expenses  drug development costs  salaries and related employee benefits  and share based compensation expense 
during  our most significant research and development costs were salaries  benefits  and share based compensation expense  costs associated with the conduct of our continuing two year carcinogenicity study for silenor  costs relating to the resubmission of the silenor nda to the fda and drug development costs pertaining to silenor 
in our most significant costs were associated with our development program for silenor  including the conduct of a voluntary standard clinical trial designed to evaluate the potential for ecg effects of doxepin  which is the active ingredient in silenor  the preparation of our nda for silenor and salaries  benefits and share based compensation expense related to research and development personnel 
during our most significant costs were associated with our development program for silenor  including the conduct of standard toxicology studies requested by the fda  and the preparation and submission of our nda for silenor as well as salaries  benefits and share based compensation expense related to research and development personnel 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects and many resources are not attributable to specific projects 
accordingly  we do not account for our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
we use external service providers to conduct our non clinical studies and clinical trials and to manufacture the product candidates used in our studies 
these external costs are accounted for on a project basis 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the drug development process with respect to product candidates we may develop  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development for potential commercialization 
non clinical and clinical development timelines  the probability of success and the costs of development of product candidates vary widely 
the lengthy process of completing non clinical testing  seeking regulatory approval  and conducting clinical trials requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in obtaining regulatory approval  or completing non clinical testing or clinical trials for silenor or any future product candidates  would cause our research and development expense to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we expect our research and development expenses to remain a significant component of our operating expenses in the future as we continue our non clinical studies and conduct post approval development work for silenor and potentially pursue development of other product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether silenor will be subject to a future collaboration or other strategic transaction  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangement would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of silenor or any related collaboration agreement  if at all 
marketing  general and administrative expenses our marketing  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  share based compensation expense  advertising and market research costs  insurance and facility costs  and professional fees related to our marketing  administrative  finance  human resources  legal and internal systems support functions 
because our nda for silenor has recently been approved by the fda  we would expect our marketing  general and administrative expenses to increase as we add personnel and prepare for the potential commercial launch of silenor 

table of contents we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether silenor will be subject to a future collaboration or other strategic transaction  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangement would affect our commercialization plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of silenor or any related collaboration agreement  if at all 
interest and other income interest and other income consist primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
we expect our interest income to increase to the extent that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increase due to capital raising activities  offset by decreases to the extent our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances decrease from continued operating losses 
interest and other expense interest and other expense consist primarily of interest expense incurred on our outstanding debt which was repaid in full in march we have not incurred any interest expense since the repayment of this debt 
however  we will need to raise additional financing  and if such financing is in the form of additional debt  our interest expense would increase 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
license fees to date  the costs related to patents and acquisition of our intellectual property have been expensed as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these expenditures is in connection with our development efforts and has no alternative future use 
certain of our license agreements contain provisions which obligate us to make milestone payments or provide other consideration if specified events occur 
determining whether these events will occur  and the timing of such events  requires judgment on the part of management 
for instance  the approval of the nda for silenor triggered a million milestone payment obligation to our licensor 
as of december   we had not recognized this milestone in our financial statements  as fda approval was not considered probable at that time 
research and development expenses our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expense includes internal costs such as salaries  benefits and share based compensation expense  as well costs from external service providers relating to our clinical trials  non clinical studies and our nda filing for silenor and drug development costs 
measurement of these external research and development expenses often requires judgment as we may not have been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs  making it necessary to estimate the efforts completed to date and the related expense 
the period over which services are performed  the level of services performed as of a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
our principal vendors operate within terms of contracts which establish program costs and estimated timelines 
we assess the status of our programs through regular discussions between our program management team and the related vendors 
based on these assessments  we determine the progress of our programs in relation to the scope of work outlined in the contracts  and recognize the related amount of expense accordingly 
we adjust our estimates as actual costs become known to us 
changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations 

table of contents share based compensation share based compensation expense for employees and directors is recognized in the statement of operations based on estimated amounts  including the grant date fair value  the probability of achieving performance conditions and the expected service period for awards with conditional vesting provisions 
for stock options  we estimate the grant date fair value using the black scholes valuation model which requires the use of multiple subjective inputs 
such subjective inputs include an estimate of future volatility  expected forfeitures and the expected term for the stock option award 
our stock did not have a readily available market prior to our initial public offering in december  creating a relatively short history from which to obtain data to estimate volatility for our stock price 
consequently  we estimate our expected future volatility based on a combination of both comparable companies and our own stock price volatility to the extent such history is available 
our future volatility may differ from our estimated volatility at the grant date 
we estimate the expected term of our options using guidance provided by the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
and sab no 
this guidance provides a formula driven approach for determining the expected term 
share based compensation recorded in our statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from actual forfeiture rates which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period 
we recognize the value of the portion of the awards that are expected to vest on a straight line basis over the awards requisite service periods 
the requisite service period is generally the time over which the company s share based awards vest 
some of our share based awards vest upon achieving certain performance conditions  generally pertaining to approval of the silenor nda by the fda  the commercial launch of silenor  or the achievement of financing or strategic objectives 
share based compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the time the applicable condition is met 
if the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved  then no expense is recognized until such time the performance condition is considered probable of being met 
at that time  expense is recognized over the period during which the performance condition is likely to be achieved 
determining the likelihood and timing of achieving performance conditions is a subjective judgment made by management which may affect the amount and timing of expense related to these share based awards 
for example  as of december   we had not recognized in our financial statements expense related to certain of our performance based awards because at that time it was not considered probable that the fda would approve silenor  or that we would achieve the commercial launch of silenor  or that we would satisfy such other strategic objectives necessary for the awards to vest 
share based compensation is adjusted to reflect the value of options which ultimately vest as such amounts become known in future periods 
as a result of these subjective and forward looking estimates  the actual value of our stock options realized upon exercise could differ significantly from those amounts recorded in our financial statements 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we have incurred significant net operating losses to date 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million and california net operating loss carryforwards of million 
federal net operating loss carryforwards expire years after being generated and california net operating loss carryforwards expire ten years after being generated 
we also have research and development credits as of december  of million for federal purposes and million for california purposes 
federal research and development credits expire years after being generated and california research and development credits do not expire 
we have fully reserved our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits until such time that it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than percent occurs within a three year period 
we determined that such an ownership change occurred as of june  as a result of various stock issuances used to finance our development activities 
this ownership change resulted in limitations on the utilization of tax attributes  including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
we estimate that approximately million of our california net operating loss carryforwards were effectively eliminated 
a portion of the remaining net operating losses limited by section becomes available for use each year 
as of march   we have not updated our section analysis  which was completed in conjunction with our initial public offering in december there is a risk that additional changes in ownership could have occurred since that date 
if a change in ownership were to have occurred  it is possible that additional net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryovers could be eliminated or restricted 
in addition  future financing events may cause further changes in ownership under section which could cause our net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards to be subject to future limitations 

table of contents debt and interest expense in may  we entered into a loan agreement under which we borrowed million  less debt issuance costs of million  for net proceeds of million 
in connection with the loan agreement  we issued warrants with a value of million which was allocated to equity and resulted in a corresponding debt discount 
in march  we repaid the entire remaining million principal amount of the loan  together with the final payment of million required under the loan agreement 
in connection with the repayment  we issued to one of the lenders a warrant to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock having a ten year term and an exercise price of  which the lenders agreed to accept in lieu of the million prepayment penalty required under the loan agreement 
we no longer have any obligations under the loan agreement 
prior to our repayment of the loan  the lenders had the right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in an event of default  which included  among other things  a material adverse change in our business  operations or financial condition or a material impairment in the prospect of repayment of the loan 
based on our recurring losses  negative cash flows from operations and working capital levels  and to reflect the lenders right to declare the loan immediately due and payable  we classified the december  outstanding debt balance as a current liability and classified the related restricted cash which collateralized this debt as a current asset 
in addition  as of december   we fully accreted to interest expense the debt discount  debt issuance costs  final payment and the value of the warrants issued in lieu of the prepayment penalty

silenor n a nalmefene and acamprosate total license fees for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   license fees decreased million primarily due to the termination of our license agreement with biotie for nalmefene in march pursuant to the termination agreement  biotie paid us a million termination fee which we included as a reduction of license fees 
also contributing to the decrease was a payment we made of million during the third quarter of under a license arrangement for the exclusive rights to purchase a certain ingredient used in our formulation for silenor 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   license fees decreased million primarily due to a million decrease related to acamprosate as a result of not incurring quarterly license payments after the license was terminated in the fourth quarter of partially offsetting this decrease was a million increase in license fees related to the silenor program as a result of a payment made under an agreement entered into during the third quarter of pertaining to the exclusive rights to a key ingredient used in our formulation for silenor

silenor development work personnel and other costs share based compensation expense total research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   research and development expense decreased million primarily due to a decrease in drug development activities for silenor as a result of the completion during of our cardiac study for silenor and the delay in the fda approval process for silenor 
offsetting these reductions in expense was a payment to our silenor packaging supplier of million in december in settlement for purchase authorizations for certain expired raw materials 
personnel and other costs decreased as a result of a reduction in headcount  which occurred as part of 
table of contents our cost reduction measures 
this reduction in headcount also caused a decrease in share based compensation expense  but this decrease was partially offset by accelerated vesting and continued vesting under consulting arrangements for certain employees whose employment was terminated 
the consulting arrangements were considered non substantive for accounting purposes and the full value of the awards expected to vest over the consulting arrangement was expensed at the time employment was terminated 
the decrease in share based compensation expense was also offset by share based compensation expense incurred in conjunction with our one time stock option exchange program in june for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   research and development expense increased million primarily due to costs incurred related to a standard clinical trial that we voluntarily conducted during to evaluate the potential for cardiac effects of doxepin  the active ingredient in silenor 
silenor development costs also increased due to higher costs incurred during relating to efforts to prepare for the potential commercialization of silenor  offset by a reduction in development expenses due to the completion during of the majority of the non clinical studies requested by the fda our two year rat carcinogenicity study remains on going 
personnel and other costs decreased primarily due to bonus expense incurred during  but which was not incurred during as we did not accrue for a bonus during given certain cost reduction activities 
share based compensation  which is a non cash expense  increased million primarily due to share based awards granted during marketing  general and administrative expense

personnel and related costs also decreased as a result of our cost reduction measures  including our reduction in headcount  our move to a smaller corporate facility  our board of directors receiving restricted stock units in lieu of cash compensation  and lower legal  audit and consulting fees during the decrease in personnel costs from the reduction in workforce was partially offset by expenses incurred in conjunction with severance arrangements entered into during share based compensation expense increased due to our one time stock option exchange program completed in june and due to accelerated vesting and continued vesting under non substantive consulting arrangements for certain employees whose employment was terminated during this increase in share based compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease in share based compensation expense from our reduction in headcount 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   marketing  general and administrative expense increased million primarily due to increased expenditures related to the preparation for the potential commercialization of silenor  certain expenses incurred related to evaluating financing alternatives  and expense recognized from terminating our building lease 
this was partially offset by bonus expense incurred during  but not incurred in due to our cost reduction activities 
share based compensation expense decreased primarily due to accelerated vesting for stock options during upon the departure of our chief executive officer  as well as certain stock options with higher grant date fair values becoming fully vested during interest and other income

interest and other expense n a for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest and other expense decreased million due to our repayment in full of the outstanding balance of our debt facility in march we will not incur additional interest expense on this debt going forward 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest and other expense increased million primarily due to interest expense incurred on a debt facility we entered into during the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we classified our outstanding debt balance as a current liability and as of december   we fully accreted the debt discount  debt issuance costs  final payment and the value of the warrants issued in lieu of the prepayment penalty to interest expense 
we did not have any debt or related interest expense prior to liquidity and capital resources since inception  our operations have been financed through the private placement of equity securities and our initial public offering 
through december   we received cumulative net proceeds of approximately million as follows net proceeds of million from the sale and issuance of an aggregate of  shares of preferred stock as follows from august through january  we issued and sold an aggregate of  shares of series a preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
from april through june  we issued and sold an aggregate of  shares of series b preferred stock for net proceeds of million after deducting offering costs of million 
in june  we issued and sold  shares of series c redeemable preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million after deducting offering costs of million 
in september  the warrant instrument issued in conjunction with the june series c stock issuance was exercised  and we issued and sold an additional  shares of series c redeemable preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
net proceeds of million from the sale and issuance of  shares of our common stock in our initial public offering in december  after deducting offering costs of million 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock at a ratio of six shares of preferred stock converting into one share of common stock 
net proceeds of million from the sale and issuance of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in a private placement in july  after deducting financing costs of million 
since our inception in august through december   we have issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options from which we have received aggregate proceeds of million 
we also have issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock from the exercise of warrants  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of million 

table of contents as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in money market funds placed with reputable financial institutions for which credit loss is not anticipated 
the capital markets have recently been highly volatile and there has been a lack of liquidity for certain financial instruments  especially those with exposure to mortgage backed securities and auction rate securities 
this lack of liquidity has made it potentially difficult for the fair value of these types of instruments to be determined 
our money market funds are with institutions that have minimal mortgage backed security exposure and we do not hold any auction rate securities 
all of our investments in money market funds continue to be highly rated  highly liquid and have readily determinable fair values 
as a result  none of our securities are considered to be impaired 
we have established guidelines relating to credit rating  diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
the diversity in maturities of our holdings provides us the capability to generally hold our securities until maturity  which we regularly do 
this allows any temporary changes in the value of our securities due to market volatility to be recovered by the time the securities mature 
to date  realized gains and losses from the sale of securities prior to their maturity have been negligible 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing and other commercial capabilities  if required  the extent to which we acquire or in license new products  technologies or businesses  the rate of progress and cost of our non clinical studies  clinical trials and other development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of development programs we pursue  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
cash flows we expect to continue to incur losses and have negative cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future as we seek to commercialize silenor and potentially pursue the development of other product candidates 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to our cost reduction measures  including the termination of employment of a large portion of our workforce 
in addition  during we voluntarily conducted a standard clinical trial to evaluate the potential for ecg effects of doxepin  the active ingredient in silenor  and prepared for the potential commercialization of silenor 
we cannot be certain if  when  or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of silenor 
we expect our operating expenses to be substantial over the next few years as we seek to commercialize silenor and potentially pursue the development of other product candidates 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources and through strategic relationships  public or private equity or debt financings  assigning receivables or royalty rights or other arrangements 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining additional financing when needed 
if available  financing may not be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
we also may not be successful in entering into strategic collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
if we are unsuccessful in raising sufficient additional funds  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate development plans or programs relating to our business  relinquish some or all rights to silenor or renegotiate less favorable terms with respect to such rights than we would otherwise choose  or cease operating as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 

table of contents we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the sec 
this registration statement could allow us to obtain additional financing 
however  our ability to obtain such additional financing will still be subject to the sec s rules and regulations relating to eligibility to use form s under current sec regulations  at any time during which the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non affiliates  or public float  is less than million  the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve month period using shelf registration statements will be limited to an aggregate of one third of our public float 
as of march   our public float was greater than million 
as a result of recent volatility in the capital markets  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected 
concern about the stability of the markets in general and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
the report of our registered public accounting firm for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about or ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to continue as a going concern  we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which these assets are carried on our financial statements  and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment 
in response to the fda s delay of the pdufa date for silenor in november and the complete response letter we received from the fda in february  we implemented certain cost reduction measures 
from december through may  we completed a reduction in our workforce which eliminated employment for employees  and we currently have five remaining full time employees 
in addition  in november  our board of directors amended the director compensation policy to provide that non employee directors will receive their quarterly retainers for service on the board of directors or committees thereof and their fees for attending meetings of the board and committees thereof in rsus under our equity incentive award plan in lieu of cash compensation 
the compensation arrangement of david hale  our chairman of the board  was also amended in november so that his cash compensation for his former role as executive chairman of the board was payable in rsus 
mr 
hale has since reassumed his position as our non executive chairman of the board effective june   and as such he is compensated for his services in rsus under the director compensation policy 
in addition  we did not make a cash bonus award under our incentive plan  and we have not made a cash bonus award under our incentive plan 
furthermore  we have been and will continue working with certain of our suppliers and vendors to manage our cash expenditures relating to our operations 
common stock financing in july  we completed a private placement of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase up to million additional shares of our common stock  exercisable in cash or by net exercise at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million after deducting offering costs of million 
the warrants are immediately exercisable and expire in july in connection with the private placement  we filed a registration statement with the sec for the resale of both the shares of common stock purchased by the investors and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
we also agreed to other customary obligations regarding registration  including matters relating to indemnification  maintenance of the registration statement and payment of expenses 
the resale registration statement was declared effective by the sec in august we may be liable for liquidated damages if we do not maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement or the listing of the common stock on the nasdaq capital market  the nasdaq global market  the new york stock exchange or the american stock exchange  in each case for a period of ten consecutive days or for more than thirty days in any day period 
the amount of the liquidated damages is one percent per applicable ten or thirty day period  subject to an aggregate maximum of eight percent per calendar year  of the aggregate purchase price of the common stock purchased in the private placement then held by each investor that are registrable securities 
we do not believe it is probable we will be required to pay liquidated damages  and we have not recognized any amounts in our financial statements related to such potential liquidated damages 

table of contents loan and security agreement in may  we entered into the loan agreement with silicon valley bank and oxford finance corporation under which we borrowed million  less debt issuance costs of million  for net proceeds of million 
in connection with entering into the loan agreement  we issued warrants to silicon valley bank and oxford finance corporation to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and a ten year term 
in march  we repaid the entire remaining million principal amount of the loan  together with the final payment of million required under the loan agreement 
in connection with the repayment  we issued to one of the lenders a warrant to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock having a ten year term and an exercise price of  which the lenders agreed to accept in lieu of the million prepayment penalty required under the loan agreement 
we no longer have any obligations under the loan agreement 
committed equity financing facility in may  we entered into a committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital ltd  or kingsbridge  pursuant to which kingsbridge committed to provide capital financing for a period of three years through the purchase of a maximum of approximately  newly issued shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations as set forth in the common stock purchase agreement 
we did not issue and sell any shares of our common stock under the ceff 
in july  we terminated the ceff and no longer have any obligations under the agreements relating to the ceff 
in connection with entering into the ceff  we issued to kingsbridge a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at the purchase price of per share 
the warrant remains exercisable  subject to certain exceptions  until november contractual obligations we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize silenor 
pursuant to these agreements  we obtained exclusive  sub licenseable rights to the patents and know how for certain indications 
we generally are required to make upfront payments as well as additional payments upon the achievement of specific development and regulatory approval milestones 
we are also obligated to pay royalties under the agreements until the later of the expiration of the applicable patent or the applicable last date of market exclusivity following the first commercial sale 
the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period through through after total operating lease obligations total the approval of our nda for silenor triggered a milestone payment obligation of million to procom one inc  and we are also obligated to make revenue based royalty payments

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents at december  consists primarily of money market funds 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we also periodically invest in united states government debt securities 
to the extent we hold securities other than money market funds  our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities consisting of money market funds and united states government debt securities  all with various maturities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we also generally time the maturities of our investments to correspond with our expected cash needs  allowing us to avoid realizing any potential losses from having to sell securities prior to their maturities 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
our cash is invested in accordance with a policy approved by our board of directors which specifies the categories  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
we do not believe our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
we made this determination based on discussions with our treasury managers and a review of our holdings 
while we believe our cash and cash equivalents are well diversified and do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide absolute assurance that our investments will not be subject to future adverse changes in market value
