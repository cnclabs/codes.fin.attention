the following section provides a narrative discussion about the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere within this report 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of the company s consolidated statements of income  as a percentage of revenues year ended december  of sales spartan chassis evteam utili master consol idated spartan chassis evteam consol idated spartan chassis evteam consol idated sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative operating income loss other income expense  net earnings before taxes on income taxes on income net earnings loss the company acquired utilimaster on november  a key metric in measuring the company s success is the company s return on invested capital roic 
the company defines roic as operating income  less taxes  divided by total shareholders equity 
roic for the year ended december  was  a percentage point decrease as compared to roic of in year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   consolidated sales decreased significantly by million to million from million in the decrease was largely due to a million decrease in the spartan chassis segment sales coupled with a million increase in evteam segment sales and a million sales increase from the november  acquisition of utilimaster 
intercompany sales from spartan chassis to the evteam increased million over the prior year  as increased volumes of spartan chassis custom chassis were sold to evteam 
intercompany sales are eliminated from consolidated sales totals 
at spartan chassis  the majority of its sales decrease was driven by the reduction in its specialty vehicle sales volume  which decreased by million from million to million year over year 
this change was primarily due to the completion of orders shipped under the mine resistant ambush protected mrap program in this was a unique large defense contract that specifically affected sales levels beginning in and through see item a risk factors relating to government contracts for more details 
the majority of the sales increase for the evteam is a result of higher fire truck sales  which were up over the prior year 
the higher fire truck sales driven by higher order intake at the end of  was in part due to the engine emissions change 
there were no significant change s associated with pricing changes on the company s products 
cost of products sold decreased as a percent of sales from to due primarily to sales mix 
sales mix included higher service part sales during which have lower overhead and labor costs associated with them 
the evteam segment also experienced lower cost of products sold as a percent of sales as higher volume levels improved efficiencies and absorption of overhead 
these savings more than offset the additional million from restructuring charges incurred during gross margin as a percent of sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the same time period in primarily due to higher volumes on the increased service part sales noted above 
the evteam contributed to the increase in margins with increases to from the year previous  mainly due to increased volumes and product mix 
operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for the twelve month period ended december  compared to for the same period of this is primarily a result of the large drop in sales year over year 
as a percent of sales  operating expenses in were negatively impacted by a million settlement 
operating expense dollars decreased million  from million to million due primarily to the realignment of the company s cost structure see note  restructuring  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in addition to lower compensation expense for incentive plans in the lower compensation expense for incentive plans is a result of the lower financial results year over year  combined with lower staffing levels as part of cost realignment activities 
these savings were partially offset by one time charges of million related to restructuring activities and million related to acquisition activities see note  acquisition activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the decrease in the company s income taxes to million in from million in is primarily due to decreased earnings before taxes in compared to the effective tax rate was in as compared to in the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by a non deductible settlement 
see note  taxes on income  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 
net earnings decreased by million per diluted share to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in as a result of the factors discussed above 
total chassis orders received during decreased compared to the same period in this reflects decreases in specialty vehicle chassis orders  which were down  as military orders in were less than those placed in the evteam experienced a decrease in orders received of during compared to  which was also due to the changes in industry regulations 
motorhome chassis orders were lower by compared to due to the poor economic conditions 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in fire truck chassis orders of in advance of the changes in certain industry regulations effective for january  as customers place orders to lock into the remaining transitional engines 
in  the company expects a challenging year as reflected in the order volumes depicted above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   consolidated sales increased million to million  from million for the same period in the increase was due to a million increase in spartan chassis sales coupled with a million increase in evteam sales 
intercompany sales from spartan chassis to the evteam increased million over the prior year 
intercompany sales are eliminated from the consolidated sales totals 
other sales at spartan chassis drove the majority of its sales increase  with a million increase over the prior year s period 
also contributing to the increase in consolidated sales was an increase in fire truck chassis sales of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in motorhome chassis sales of million 
the increase in other sales at spartan chassis was primarily due to an increase of specialty chassis of million paired with an increase in service part sales of million 
the growth in specialty chassis was due to increases in military chassis volume primarily as a result of orders received under the mrap program 
production under this program began in the third quarter of and the backlog of orders received as of december  continued production through most of additionally  other sales were affected by an increase in volume of service part sales 
these sales correspond to increased military vehicles in the field  primarily as a result of the mrap program mentioned above 
see item a risk factors relating to government contracts for more details 
the decrease in motorhome chassis sales was due to lower order volume  as a result of weakened economic conditions impacting the motorhome market as a whole 
the year over year backlog of motorhome orders decreased as of december  the majority of the sales increase for the evteam was a result of increased ambulance sales of million  partially offset by a decrease in fire truck sales of million 
ambulance sales were up over  from million to million  which is largely due to higher order intake at the end of fire truck sales were down approximately year over year due primarily to decreased sales volumes as result of lower orders received during the year 
backlog for the evteam  at december   was up million compared to december  increased backlog at the end of was in part due to the changes in industry safety regulations and the engine emissions change 
gross margin as a percent of sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the same time period in the increase was due primarily to sales mix mainly as a result of higher service parts sales during  which provide a higher gross margin 
in addition  the company was able to leverage fixed overhead costs to increased sales volumes  which resulted in higher margins 
the evteam also contributed to the increase in margins resulting from price increases for ambulances  approximately per unit  and improved production efficiencies for fire trucks  approximately per unit 
operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for the twelve month period ended december  compared to for the same period of this was primarily a result of one time charges  primarily legal expenses and settlement costs 
costs of million related to the reported settlement between spartan chassis and the department of justice 
see item legal proceedings of this form k for more details 
operating expenses increased million due to the settlement costs noted above in addition to higher compensation expense for incentive plans 
the higher compensation expense for incentive plans is a result of the improved results year over year combined with greater wages and benefits related to higher staffing levels to support the sales increase 
the increase in the company s income taxes from million in to million in was primarily due to increased earnings before taxes in when compared to the effective tax rate was in as compared to in the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the increase in non deductible charges primarily related to the legal settlement costs

net earnings increased by million per diluted share to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in as a result of the factors discussed above 
total chassis orders received during decreased compared to the same period in this reflects decreases in motorhome chassis orders that were down due to the poor economic conditions 
specialty chassis orders were also down as military orders in were less than those placed in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in fire truck orders in advance of the changes in certain industry regulations effective for january the evteam experienced an increase in orders received of during over  also due to the changes in industry regulations 
the company s segments the company is organized into three reportable segments  spartan chassis  the emergency vehicle team evteam  and utilimaster  which was acquired on november  for certain financial information related to each segment  see note  business segments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
spartan chassis income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage sales cost of products sold restructuring charges gross profit operating expenses restructuring charges operating income sales decreased by million from to other product sales drove the majority of the sales decrease  with a million decrease from million to million  year over year 
the decrease in other product sales at spartan chassis was primarily due to a decrease of specialty vehicle volume sales of million  partially offset with an increase in service part sales of million 
the decrease in specialty vehicle sales was due to the completion of several large military orders in  particularly under the mrap program 
there were no changes in pricing of the company s products that had a significant impact on its financial statements when comparing year over year 
also contributing to the decrease in spartan chassis sales was the motorhome product line with sales decreasing million  from million to million year over year 
the decrease in motorhome chassis sales was due to lower order volume  as a result of weakened economic conditions impacting the motorhome market as a whole 
the year over year backlog of motorhome orders has increased as of december  accordingly  production levels of motorhome chassis are expected to be higher than they were in the sale decreases were partially offset by the increase in fire truck chassis sales of million 
the increase in fire truck sales was driven by the engine emission change 
cost of products sold decreased as a percent of sales from to due primarily to sales mix 
sales mix included higher service part sales in the period which have lower overhead and labor costs associated with it as portions of this cost is classified in operating expense 
these savings more than offset the additional million from restructuring charges incurred during gross margins increased to of sales in versus for the increase is primarily due to the increased service part sales noted above 
in addition  margins increased year over year due to a revision of the warranty estimate for military vehicles based on developed experience 
operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for the twelve month period ended december  compared to for the same period of this is primarily a result of the large decrease in sales volumes as noted above 
operating expenses decreased million year over year due to a reduction in legal fees  settlement costs and compensation accruals for incentive plans 
operating income decreased in to of sales compared to of sales in  due primarily to higher levels of operating expense in proportion to sales levels as detailed above 
evteam income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage sales cost of products sold restructuring charges gross profit operating expenses restructuring charges operating income loss evteam s reported operating loss of million was an improvement of million compared to the improvement was driven by increased fire truck sales volume partially offset by lower ambulance sales volume 
the fire truck sales volume increase  year over year  was due in part to the engine emissions change likely driving up sales orders in advance of the new requirements 
sales for increased million over of this increase  million was driven by an increase in delivery volume as previously noted  million by price increases  and million by a change in product mix toward more expensive vehicles 
the backlog for the evteam at december  was million  down from million at december   as it returns to more normalized levels following the emissions change effective for cost of products sold decreased as a percent of sales as absorption of overhead costs were more favorable at higher sales volume levels 
cost of sales for increased by million over of this increase  million was driven by an increase in delivery volume and million by a change in product mix  offset by a million reduction in material costs 
the positive material variances were primarily as a result of the product mix and certain lower commodity costs than experienced in the prior year 
accordingly  margins for the evteam improved year over year to from 
operating expenses for increased by  million over this increase was largely a result of increased spending in support of revenue growth and the write off of approximately million receivable associated with the financial distress of a dealer 
backlog for the evteam  at december   was down million compared to december  and will impact production levels and sales in decreased backlog at the end of is in part due to municipalities hesitant to make purchase commitments in the current budget cycle 
the company has experienced operating losses at its evteam over the past several years  but expects to bring this reporting unit to profitability in by strengthening the dealer distribution network  streamlining the cost structure  reducing carrying costs associated with inventory and accounts receivable  and introducing new and innovative products 
utilimaster income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses operating income loss represents one month of activity due to acquisition of entity on november  sales for the month of december were unusually strong as a result of completing units to meet customer year end delivery requirements 
utilimaster sales represented of consolidated sales for the month 
cost of sales as a percent of sales for the month were higher than normal levels  primarily driven by product mix and product content issues 
an additional significant driver of higher costs was a million inventory related charge due to the utilimaster acquisition 
the required adjustment of all assets and liabilities to fair value resulted in the step up of work in process and finished goods inventory upon acquisition 
as this inventory was sold during the month of december  the step up in value was charged to cost of products sold 
operating expenses were higher compared to historical norms 
the higher level of spending was primarily driven by higher research and development costs associated with a large product in development 
research and development expenses in are expected to range about million to million primarily related to the continued development of this product 
fourth quarter results the company s sales levels have varied historically from quarter to quarter 
for a description of quarterly financial data  see note  quarterly financial data unaudited  of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k 
sales during the fourth quarter of were slightly lower than the prior quarters of  after excluding the sales of utilimaster  which was acquired on november  sales were lower primarily due to the decrease in service part sales within the other product grouping of the spartan chassis segment 
these declines were offset in part by increases in motorhome sales which continue to show an upward trend when comparing the previous four quarters 
in addition  fire truck chassis and bodies both showed upward trends during the course of the year 
the company believes that the engine emissions change positively impacted the sales increases 
gross profit was disproportionate in the fourth quarter of  showing trend lines down compared to the previous quarters primarily due to sales mix 
there were lower volumes of specialty vehicle and service part sales in the latter half of the year 
in addition  there were depressed margins at utilimaster due to the above described one time valuation charge of million incurred during december 
the evteam segment experienced gross profit volatility over the quarters  but ended the fourth quarter on average comparable to the prior four quarters 
in addition to the items detailed above  net earnings during the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by one time pre tax charges of million related to the company s acquisition of utilimaster  exclusive of the million noted above 
sales during the fourth quarter of were lower than the prior quarters in due to the higher specialty chassis sales in the first three quarters of  primarily as a result of military orders that were completed early in the fourth quarter 
additionally  motorhome sales were down compared to prior quarters in this same year  due to the continued stress in the economic market 
these decreases in sales were partially offset by an increase in the service part sales due to increased support of the military units in the field 
the fire truck chassis and evteam sales remained fairly consistent over the quarters of gross profit was disproportionate in the fourth quarter of compared to the previous quarters primarily due to sales mix 
there were higher service parts sales during the quarter  which provide higher margins 
this is partially due to the fact that certain overhead related charges associated with service parts are classified as operating expenses 
the evteam also contributed to increased margins in the quarter resulting from price increases and improved production efficiencies  as detailed in the year over year analysis 
net earnings during the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by the settlement costs related to the department of justice  in addition to the same variables noted above affecting sales and gross profit 
see item legal proceedings of this form k for more details on the settlement 
sales during the fourth quarter of were higher than the prior quarters of  driven by an increase in other product sales 
the primary factors for the increase in other product sales are consistent with the explanation for the year over year increase detailed above 
higher military chassis and service part sales drove this increase as a result of higher order volumes 
gross profit and net earnings for the fourth quarter of were higher than the prior quarters of  primarily due to the impact of the mrap program ramp up 
sales increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of  while gross profit increased over the same time period 
as production under the mrap program began in the third quarter of  material and labor efficiencies were improved in the fourth quarter of this occurred as the company s workforce became more familiar with the production of the product 
the reason net income grew more dramatically over the quarter compared to sales growth was twofold 
first  staff was added in the third quarter of ahead of the correlated sales increase to support the ramp up of the mrap program 
second  overhead operating costs do not in crease at the same level that sales increase  as most base operating expenses are already in place  such as research and development and selling  general and administrative staff 
financial condition balance sheet at december  compared to december  accounts receivable decreased million from million at december  to million at december   primarily as a result of a concerted effort to improve cash collections 
accordingly  accounts receivable days outstanding improved from days at december  to days at december  in addition  there were completed orders under the mrap program as reflected in the decreased sales of million in the fourth quarter of  as noted above 
sales in the fourth quarter of were lower than in the fourth quarter of due to the other product sales decrease detailed above 
these decreased sales  along with concerted collection efforts  directly resulted in the decrease of accounts receivable at december  when compared to december  inventory levels increased million from million at december  to million at december  the increase is primarily due to the purchase of approximately million of transitional engines 
in addition  the acquisition of utilimaster resulted in an additional million of inventory at december   that was not present at december  these increases were offset by concerted efforts to reduce inventory levels in tandem with lower sales volumes currently being experienced 
deposit on engines was million at december  related to the transitional engines 
these engines were included in inventory at of december   as detailed above  and thus the deposit balance was eliminated 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets were increased year over year directly as a result of the utilimaster acquisition 
see note acquisition activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k for further information 
accrued compensation and related taxes decreased million  from million to million year over year due to lower compensation expense for incentive plans 
the lower compensation expense for incentive plans is a result of the lower financial results year over year  combined with lower staffing levels as part of cost realignment activities 
other non current liabilities increased to million from million year over year  due to the acquisition of utilimaster which included tax reserves million and a contingent earn out liability related to the acquisition million 
in addition  there was an increase in the company s long term compensation liabilities in million compared to  related to a deferred compensation program 
long term debt increased by million to million at december  from million at december   directly as a result of financing the acquisition of utilimaster 
see note  debt and note  acquisition activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k for further information regarding debt 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table cash flow summary year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during  cash and cash equivalents increased by million to a balance of million as of december  these funds  in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance the company s foreseeable liquidity and capital needs 
for the year ended december   cash generated by operating activities  exclusive of acquisition activity  was million primarily driven by a decrease in trade accounts receivable of approximately million from million to million 
this amount and others  related to balance sheet accounts in this section  are exclusive of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the november  acquisition date of utilimaster 
such amounts are included  on a net basis  in the acquisition of business  net of cash acquired line in the consolidated statement of cash flow in item of this form k 
the decrease in trade accounts receivable reflected the decrease in sales toward the end of versus the end of  primarily due to the completion of a large scale defense vehicle contract in as well as lower service part sales during s fourth quarter 
other assets decreased approximately million as the balance was converted from deposits on engines into inventory  relating to transitional engines 
inventory balances did not change materially as the increase due to the transitional engines was offset by initiatives to draw inventory levels down to those consistent with current sales volumes 
accrued compensation decreased approximately million in as cash was utilized to pay for compensation incentives under incentive plans for improved results over see the financial condition section in item of this form k for further discussion regarding the accounts receivable  deposit on engines  accrued compensation and other balances at december  compared to december  see the consolidated statements of cash flows contained in item of this form k for the other various factors that represented the remaining fluctuation of cash from operations between the years 
cash used in investing activities of million in  increased by million over  reflecting the november  acquisition of utilimaster for million see note  acquisition activities  partially offset by lower capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures in were elevated when compared to as there were investments in for the completion of a new office building 
in  the company expects to incur capital expenditures in the range of million to million for new strategic initiatives  including the capitalization of assets related to a product in development  along with needed operational improvements or replacement of existing property  plant and equipment 
during  facilities were added to support the ramp up of production of vehicles under the mrap program and to support the increased level of military service parts sales 
cash provided by financing activities increased significantly in  reflecting the partial funding of the acquisition of utilimaster  and offset by use of cash to pay dividends of million 
during  cash used by financing activities consisted of approximately million in net debt payments  million in cash dividends and million related to stock transactions 
in  the cash from operations and proceeds from debt issuances  combined  funded the utilimaster acquisition of million  the net investment in property  plant and equipment of million  and the payment of dividends of approximately million 
working capital year ended december  current assets current liabilities working capital working capital decreased more dramatically from to than from to primarily due to the ramp down of production of vehicles under the mrap program and the decreased level of military service part sales 
the decrease in working capital from to was nominal as the addition of utilimaster resulted in additional working capital of approximately million which was offset primarily by the reduction in accounts receivable balances 
restructuring activities during  the company underwent restructuring activities see note  restructuring to align expenses to coincide with current revenue expectations 
actions of the company allowed it to maintain gross margin levels despite the fall in sales volumes 
cost reduction measures included workforce reductions  plant and operation consolidations and overall improved cost management 
an increased focus on the balance sheet also drove working capital levels down  particularly in light of the addition of utilimaster 
while restructuring charges are substantially complete  the company is continuing efforts to improve cost management through initiatives that have or will be implemented 
the company expects these co mbined activities could generate between million and million of annualized savings 
the majority of these initiatives  all of which are not expected to involve material additional upfront costs  are expected to be completed by the second quarter of contingent obligation in connection with the acquisition of utilimaster see note  acquisition activities  for further details  the company incurred contingent obligations through in the form of certain performance based earn out payments  up to an aggregate maximum amount of million 
in accordance with accounting guidance  the company recorded the estimated fair value of the future consideration to be million based upon the likelihood of the payments  discounted to the acquisition date 
the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund the contingent obligations as they become due

these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within the company s operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related statement of income  asset and or liability amounts 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with authoritative guidelines  including those of the sec 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
in certain instances  risk of ownership and title passes when the product has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer 
on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions  revenue recognition occurs after the customer has been notified that the products have been completed according to the customer specifications  have passed all of the company s quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery 
all sales are shown net of returns  discounts and sales incentive programs  which historically have not been significant 
the collectability of any related receivable is reasonably ass ured before revenue is recognized 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for customer accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management makes certain assumptions regarding the risk of uncollectable open receivable accounts 
this risk factor is applied to the balance on accounts that are aged over days generally this reserve has an estimated range from 
the risk percentage applied to the aged accounts may change based on conditions such as general economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts from year to year 
however  generally the company s assumptions are consistent year over year and there has been little adjustment made to the percentages used 
i n addition  in the event there are certain known risk factors with an open account  the company may increase the allowance to include estimated losses on such specific account balances 
the specific reserves are identified by a periodic review of the aged accounts receivable 
if there is an account in question  credit checks are made and there is communication with the customer  along with other means to try to assess if a specific reserve is required 
the inclusion of the specific reserve has caused the greatest fluctuation in the allowance for doubtful accounts balance historically 
please see note  general and summary of accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and appendix a included in this form k for further details and historical view of the allowanc e for doubtful accounts balance 
impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with authoritative guidance on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles assets  such assets are tested for impairment at least annually  and written down when and to the extent impaired 
an interim impairment test is required if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below the carrying value 
management evaluates the recoverability of indefinite lived assets by estimating the future cash flows of the reporting units to which the asset relates  and then discounting the future cash flows at a market participant derived weighted average cost of capital 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  management considers current and projected future levels of income based on management s plans for that business  business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions  and market participant considerations 
when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  management measures and recognizes the amount of the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment loss  if any 
impairment losses  limited to the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets  represent the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit s inde finite lived intangible asset over the implied fair value of that indefinite lived intangible asset 
the implied fair value of a reporting unit is estimated based on a hypothetical allocation of each reporting unit s fair value to all of its underlying assets and liabilities 
the entire goodwill of the evteam of million at december   related solely to crimson fire  inc  a reporting unit of that segment 
the estimated fair value of crimson fire  inc exceeded its associated book value by as of october   the most recent annual assessment date 
please refer to note  goodwill and intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further details 
in conjunction with the recent acquisition of utilimaster  the company recorded million of goodwill and million of other indefinite lived intangible asset for its trade name 
authoritative guidance requires that purchased intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be indefinite 
the acquired utilimaster trade name has an indefinite life as it is anticipated that it will contribute cash flows to the company indefinitely 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are evaluated at each reporting period to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate and whether there has been any impairment of this intangible asset 
due to the recent acquisition of utilimaster  it is the company s assessment that there is no impairment associated with its goodwill and oth er indefinite lived intangible asset at december  such assets will be evaluated for impairment at october   absent any unexpected events or circumstances that might indicate an earlier impairment 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  the impact of the general economic environment  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  and other risk factors as detailed in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
warranties the company s policy is to record a provision for the estimated cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale  and periodically adjust the warranty liability to reflect actual experience 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects actual historical warranty cost  which is accumulated on specific identifiable units 
from that point  there is a projection of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty agreements 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts and labor for field retrofit campaigns and recalls  which increase the reserve 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the number of units involved and the extent of features and components included in product models 
over time  this method has been c onsistently applied and has proven to be an appropriate approach to estimating future costs to be incurred 
in  there were adjustments to the warranty reserve relating to military vehicles  where the company s specific warranty experience data had been limited to specific data for commercial vehicles in previous years 
therefore  in the past year there was a change in estimate for warranty liability related to the military vehicles to more accurately reflect actual warranty claims made for these specific vehicles 
the impact from the change in estimate during was a million reduction in the liability 
see also note  commitments and contingent liabilities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  for further information regarding warranties

effect of inflation inflation affects the company in two principal ways 
first  the company s revolving notes payable is generally tied to the prime and libor interest rates so that increases in those interest rates would be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  the company attempts to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of its products 
however  the company generally does not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into its contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as nine months  the company has limited ability to pass on cost increases to its customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets served by the company are competitive in nature  and competition limits the company s ability to pass through cost increases in many cases 
the company strives to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is a change in interest rates and the effect of such a change on outstanding variable rate short term and long term debt 
at december   the company had million of debt outstanding under its variable rate short term and long term debt agreements 
an increase of in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading or other purposes 
the company does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss to the company 
as of the date of this report  the company does not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of its primary market risk exposure in the near term 
in this discussion  near term means a period of one year following the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in this report 
prevailing interest rates and interest rate relationships are primarily determined by market factors that are beyond the company s control 
all information provided in response to this item consists of forward looking statements
