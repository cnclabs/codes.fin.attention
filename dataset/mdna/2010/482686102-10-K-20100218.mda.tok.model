overview the company designs  develops and markets an array of athletic footwear for high performance sports use  fitness activities and casual wear under the k swiss brand  and also designs and manufactures footwear under the palladium brand 
for the palladium brand  footwear is designed  developed and marketed to adventurers for all terrains 
the categories of footwear we sell are explained in more detail in part i  item  under the subheading  products 
we market our products in the united states through company employed sales managers and independent regional sales representatives primarily to a limited number of specialty athletic footwear stores  pro shops  sporting good stores and department stores 
we also sell our products through our website and internationally through company employed sales managers  independent sales representatives and a number of foreign distributors 
the retail environment has been particularly challenging during the last few years and is forecasted for the near term to remain depressed  given the deterioration in the overall economy and financial markets 
this could put additional pressure on the company s ability to maintain margins 
in  approximately of our k swiss brand footwear products were manufactured in china 
we have no long term manufacturing agreements  but we believe that our relationships with our producers are satisfactory and that we have the ability to develop alternative sources for our footwear 
our operations could  however  be materially and adversely affected if a substantial delay occurred in locating and obtaining alternative producers 
because we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to our customer  our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of products 
our total revenues decreased in from  due to a decrease in the volume of footwear sold and a decrease in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in our gross profit margin is mainly due to product mix changes  geographic mix of international sales and a general decline in sales prices partially due to a higher percentage of sales of close out product which contributes to a lower gross profit margin 
our overall selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  in from  in as a result of decreases in advertising expenses  data processing expenses  compensation expenses and legal expenses 
in addition  an impairment charge of  on the goodwill and intangible assets related to the trademarks of the palladium brand was recognized in other expense for includes a loss upon the purchase of the remaining equity interest of palladium of  offset by a gain on the sale of certain assets of the royal elastics brand of  operations of the royal elastics brand have been accounted for and presented as a 
table of contents discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements 
other income for consisted of a settlement payment of  in connection with a lawsuit protecting our trademarks

of this amount  domestic futures orders were  a decrease of  and international futures orders were  a decrease of 
the net loss for was  or per share diluted loss per share  compared to net earnings of  or per share diluted earnings per share  for net loss and diluted loss per share for included the pre tax impairment charge on the goodwill and intangible assets related to the trademarks of the palladium brand of  and the pre tax loss of  on the purchase of the remaining of palladium  offset by the net pre tax gain on the sale of certain royal elastics assets of  described above 
net earnings and diluted earnings per share for included the pre tax settlement of litigation of  described above 
in  we had a net cash outflow of  from continuing operations  a net cash outflow of  from investing activities due the purchase of investments available for sale  reclassification of  to restricted cash and cash equivalents as collateral for our lines of credit and the purchase of property plant and equipment and a net cash inflow of  from financing activities mainly as a result of proceeds from stock options exercised and by the excess income tax benefit of stock based compensation  offset by net repayments on bank lines of credit 
we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to borrowings under our lines of credit and  depending on future operating results  additional funds may be required for operating activities 
at december  and  we had debt outstanding of  and  attributable to outstanding borrowings by palladium under its lines of credit facilities and term loans  excluding outstanding letters of credit of  and  at december  and  respectively 
our working capital decreased  to  at december  from  at december   mainly due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash  inventory  accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets and current deferred income taxes  offset by decreases in trade accounts payable  accrued liabilities and bank lines of credit and short term debt and increases in investments available for sale and income taxes receivable 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  intangible assets  sales returns and allowances  and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
in the 
table of contents past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see results of operations compared to other income  interest and taxes  for discussion regarding the estimate and settlement of an underpayment of payroll withholdings in a foreign jurisdiction from january  through december  we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer according to the terms of the order 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and allowances as reductions to revenues 
we base our estimates on historical rates of returns and allowances and specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
however  actual returns and allowances in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses based on our knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers and historical level of credit losses  as well as an assessment of the overall retail conditions 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from differences that arise from the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers estimate are owed to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
our allowance for bad debts as a percentage of accounts receivable have remained relatively constant over the past three years despite the weak economy due to our increased scrutiny of customer relationships 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the market value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record the additional charge to cost of sales 
the inventory reserve as a percentage of inventory has decreased in from as a result of significant reserves being established in and substantial liquidation of impaired inventory in 
table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions and recognize the benefit exposure of those positions if they meet the more likely than not threshold 
any tax position recognized is an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
also  at any point in time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with tax authorities may affect tax positions taken 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the geographic mix or level of earnings 
we have not recorded united states income tax expense on earnings of selected foreign subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as permanently invested is based upon our expectations of the future cash needs of our subsidiaries 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of earnings to be permanently invested 
because the declaration involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as permanently invested may ultimately be repatriated 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determine that amounts were no longer permanently invested 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full calendar year by estimating pre tax income  excluding significant or infrequently occurring items  and tax expense for the remaining quarterly periods of the year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to year to date pre tax income to determine the estimated year to date and quarterly tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the quarterly period in which they occur 
as the year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected annual effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date income tax provision equals the estimated annual rate 
our effective tax rate fluctuates mainly due to our geographic mix of sales and earnings 
in addition  starting january   provision has not been made for united states income taxes on earnings of selected international subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested 
we evaluate the future realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly 
we review each material tax jurisdiction for which a deferred tax asset has been recorded 
our analysis includes a review of past results  future income and the tax life of net operating loss carryforwards 
all evidence is evaluated in forming a conclusion whether a valuation allowance  if any  needs to be recorded 
we account for the uncertainty in income tax positions and use a minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before recognition in the financial statements 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit expense to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit expense that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
any tax position recognized would be an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
we recognize interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings loss 
we recognize our uncertain tax positions in either accrued income taxes  if determined to be short term  or other liabilities if determined to be long term  on our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually  and more often when events indicate that an impairment exists 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we review goodwill for impairment in a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether there is potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then goodwill is not considered impaired  however  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then step two is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating fair value to all assets and liabilities 
the excess  if any  is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill  then impairment is recognized 
we review intangible assets related to trademarks for impairment  by determining fair value using a relief from royalty payments methodology 
this approach involves two steps i estimating reasonable royalty rates for each trademark and ii applying these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value then impairment is recognized 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of certain items in the consolidated statements of earnings relative to revenues 
year ended december  revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment on intangibles and goodwill other expense income interest income  net loss earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations income tax benefit expense loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefit net loss earnings compared to revenue and gross margin total revenues decreased to  in from  in this decrease was attributable to a decrease in the volume of footwear sold and a decrease in the average underlying wholesale price per pair

international revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in customer acceptance of our domestic and international product has been weak and is likely to remain weak for the near term 
in addition  the current downturn of the worldwide economy has had and will continue to have an adverse affect on our business 
k swiss brand revenues decreased to  in from  in this decrease was the result of a decrease in the volume of footwear sold and a decrease in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
the volume of footwear sold decreased to  pair in from  pair in the average wholesale price per pair was in and in  a decrease of  which resulted from the product mix of sales  including a higher percentage of sales of closeout product  and from the geographic mix of sales  in which domestic sales generally sell at a lower price  and a general decline in worldwide selling prices 
palladium brand revenues were  in of which were derived from domestic sales compared to  for the six month period ended december  all of this revenue was derived from sales outside the us we purchased palladium in july see note o to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents we believe the athletic and casual footwear industry experiences seasonal fluctuations  due to increased sales during certain selling seasons  including easter  back to school and the year end holiday seasons 
we present full line offerings for the easter season for delivery during the first and second quarters and back to school season for delivery during the third quarter  but only limited offerings for the year end holiday season 
at december   domestic and international futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were approximately  and  respectively  lower and lower  respectively  than such orders were at december  for start ship dates of the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders are not necessarily indicative of revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of future and at once orders can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and the rate of customer order cancellations can also vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
overall gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenues  was in  a decrease from in gross profit margin was affected by product mix changes  including a higher percentage of closeout product sales  which carry a lower gross profit margin than our non closeout product sales  geographic mix of sales and a general decline in sales prices 
on august   the company settled the underpayment of business taxes in a foreign jurisdiction for approximately  plus interest of approximately  see discussion results of operations compared to revenue and gross margin 
our gross margins may not be comparable to some of our competitors as we recognize warehousing costs within selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses overall selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during was the result of a decreases in advertising expenses  data processing expenses  compensation expenses and legal expenses 
advertising expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in both our domestic and international markets as part of an effort to reduce costs as our business declines 
data processing costs decreased as a result of the decrease in on going maintenance expense for our sap computer software system which resulted from the completion of the sap implementation in certain international regions in the fourth quarter of compensation expenses  which includes commissions  bonus incentive related expenses and employee recruiting and relocation expenses  decreased as a result of decreases in headcount and other bonuses incentive related expenses  offset by an increase in stock option compensation expenses 
legal expenses decreased as a result of the decreased expenses incurred to defend our trademarks 
corporate expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in corporate expenses for was a result of decreases in data processing expenses  legal expenses and accounting expenses 
the decrease in data processing expenses and legal expenses are due to the reasons discussed above 
the decrease in accounting expense was a result of lower auditing fees for non recurring events and a reduction of the outsourcing of certain accounting services 
impairment on intangibles and goodwill an impairment charge of  on the intangible assets related to the trademarks of the palladium brand was recognized for as a result of the company s annual reassessment of impairment using the relief from royalty payment methodology  using current market discount rates and royalty rates 

table of contents goodwill impairment of  was also recognized on the palladium brand for as part of its annual reassessment of impairment  the company determined the fair value of a reporting unit using both an income approach ie  discounted cash flow methodology and a market approach ie  guideline public company and guideline transactions methodologies 
as a result of the assessment  primarily based on deteriorating economic market conditions in  it was determined goodwill was impaired 
these impairment charges are included as corporate expenses for other income  interest and taxes other expense for includes a loss upon the purchase of the remaining equity interest of palladium of  offset by a gain on the sale of certain assets of the royal elastics brand of on april   we sold certain royal elastics assets  consisting of its inventory located in taiwan and its intangible trademarks  with an approximate net book value of million  to royal elastics holdings ltd 
reh  a third party  in an arm s length transaction for million 
pursuant to the asset sale agreement  reh agreed to pay us million in cash by april  of which the company has received approximately million as of december  and a million promissory note from reh for the remaining balance 
interest on the promissory note is payable quarterly at an interest rate of wall street journal prime plus 
the principal balance is due on april  the pre tax gain on sale is million for on june   we purchased the remaining equity interest in palladium for million or million and recognized a loss of million on the purchase 
the loss was calculated as the difference between the purchase price and the recorded mandatorily redeemable minority interest mrmi 
we acquired the initial equity interest in palladium on july  and the acquisition of palladium was recorded as a purchase acquisition without reflecting any minority interest but recognizing the mrmi liability 
other income for the year ended december  consists of a million settlement payment received on june  on june   the company entered into a settlement agreement with payless shoesource  inc  a missouri corporation and payless shoesource inc  a delaware corporation collectively  payless in connection with our action filed against payless in the united states district court for the central district of california western district  in which we alleged trademark and trade dress infringement  trademark dilution  unfair competition and breach of contract 
the settlement agreement provided  among other things  that payless would pay to us million in cash on or before july  in payment of compensatory damages claimed by us from payless advertising  promotion and sale of certain footwear 
overall net interest income was  of revenues in compared to  of revenues in  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in net interest income for the year ended december  was the result of lower average cash balances  lower interest rates  interest expense incurred by palladium on lines of credit and term loans  and recognition of the change in the fair value of the mrmi 
our effective tax benefit was for compared to an effective tax rate of for the  and  income tax benefit of options exercised during and  respectively  were credited to additional paid in capital and therefore did not impact the effective tax rate 
the absolute value of the effective tax rate benefit increased as a result of the geographic mix of losses  as domestic operations generated more losses at a higher effective tax benefit

we recognized income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions of  and  for and  respectively 
we did not record any valuation allowances against deferred tax assets at december  based on our history of prior operating earnings and our expectations for and beyond

as discussed above  on august   the company settled the underpayment of such business taxes for approximately  plus interest of approximately  with no penalties assessed 
selling  general and administrative expenses overall selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during was the result of a decrease in advertising expenses  gains on ineffective hedges and a decrease in salesman sample expenses  offset by increases in compensation expenses and data processing expenses 
advertising expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in both domestic and international markets as part of an effort to reduce costs as our business declines 
gains on ineffective hedges contributed to a  decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
salesman sample expenses decreased as a result of cost reductions and also as a result of our declining revenues 
data processing expenses increased as a result of on going maintenance expenses incurred in connection with the company s fourth quarter of sap implementation to our domestic and certain international operational regions and expenses related to the company s continuing sap computer software implementation to other international operational regions in the increase in compensation expenses of was due to stock option expenses recognized as a result of the repricing of stock options  see note l to our consolidated financial statements  an increase in headcount  a decrease in the reversal of bonus incentive related expenses that were calculated in accordance with the bonus formula under our economic value added incentive program and severance payments made  offset by decreases in other bonus incentive related expenses

other income  interest and taxes other income for the year ended december  consists of a million settlement payment received on june   as discussed above 
other income for the year ended december  consists of a reversal of an estimate for our underpayment of payroll withholdings in a foreign jurisdiction from january  through december  of  as discussed in our form k for  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that there was an underpayment of payroll withholdings in a foreign jurisdiction from january  through december  in  with the assistance of our tax advisors  we estimated an underpayment of withholdings and related interest totaling  of which  was recorded as a prior period adjustment  under staff accounting bulletin no 
penalties were discretionary  ranging from zero to of the taxes owed  and at that time we could not determine the likelihood of such assessment and did not recognize penalties related to this issue 
the september settlement reached with this foreign jurisdiction resulted in us paying of the payroll withholding liability plus a penalty for periods starting from may through august  however interest was not assessed 
therefore  the amount settled was lower than the amounts previously estimated 
overall net interest income was  of revenues in compared to  of revenues in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease in net interest income 
table of contents was the result of lower average interest rates along with interest expense incurred by palladium under its lines of credit and other debt offset by higher average cash balances  which resulted primarily from the  settlement received from payless on june  also included for the year ended december  was interest income from the change in fair value on the mrmi

cash from continuing operations in decreased from due primarily to the decrease in net earnings and to the difference in the amounts in changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset by changes in prepaid expenses and other assets and by stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
we had a net outflow of cash of   and  from our investing activities during  and  respectively 
the increase in investing activities in is due to the purchase of investments available for sale and the reclassification of  as collateral for our lines of credit to restricted cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by lower purchases of property plant and equipment

we had a net inflow of cash from financing activities of  during and net outflow of cash from financing activities of  and  during and  respectively 
the increase in net cash inflow during is due to a decrease in payments of dividends  offset by an increase in net repayments on bank lines of credit and decreases in excess income tax benefit of stock based compensation and proceeds from stock options exercised 
the increase in net cash outflows during was primarily due to an increase in payment of cash dividends including our special cash dividend of per share on december   and an increase in the purchase of our outstanding stock under our then current stock repurchase program 
we anticipate future cash needs for repayments required pursuant to borrowings under palladium s lines of credit facilities and term loans 
in addition  depending on our future operating results  additional funds may be required by operating activities 
no other material capital commitments

our working capital decreased  to  at december  from  at december  working capital decreased during mainly due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash  inventory  accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets and current deferred income taxes  offset by decreases in trade accounts payable  accrued liabilities and bank lines of credit and short term debt and increases in investments available for sale and income taxes receivable 
we have historically maintained higher levels of inventories relative to sales compared to our competitors because we do not ship directly to our major domestic customers from our foreign contract manufacturers to the same extent as our larger competitors  which would reduce inventory levels and increase inventory turns  and unlike many of our competitors  we designate certain shoes as core products whereby we commit to our retail customers that we will carry core products from season to season and  therefore  we attempt to maintain open stock positions on our core products in our distribution facilities to meet at once orders 

table of contents contractual obligations at december   our significant contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating lease obligations endorsement obligations royalty obligations bank debt product purchase obligations total we generally order product four to five months in advance of sales based primarily on advance futures orders received from customers 
the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during or  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at december  or inflation we believe that distributors of footwear in the higher priced end of the footwear market  including ours  are able to adjust their prices in response to an increase in direct and general and administrative expenses in order to partially or completely offset rising prices  without experiencing a significant loss in sales 
accordingly  to date  inflation and changing prices have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues or earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro  us dollar and the pound sterling and between the euro and the pound sterling 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves our risk management policies 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in foreign exchange rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
foreign exchange rate risk sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which are primarily sales to customers in europe  expose the company to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency 
the company s primary risk exposures are from changes in the rates between the us dollar and the euro  us dollar and the pound sterling and between the euro and the pound sterling 
in and  the company entered into forward 
table of contents foreign exchange contracts to exchange euros for us dollars  pound sterling for us dollars and pound sterling for euros 
the extent to which forward foreign exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to management s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of specific sales contracts 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows the company to reduce its exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflow resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers will be materially affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the forward foreign exchange contracts are designated for firmly committed or forecasted sales 
these contracts are generally expected to settle in less than one year 
the forward foreign exchange contracts generally require the company to exchange euros for us dollars  pound sterling for us dollars or pound sterling for euros at maturity  at rates agreed upon at the inception of the contracts 
the company s counterparties to derivative transactions are major financial institutions with an investment grade or better credit rating  however  the company is exposed to credit risk with these institutions 
the credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should these counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
at december   forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of  were outstanding to exchange various currencies with maturities ranging from january to september  to sell the equivalent of approximately  in foreign currencies at contracted rates and to buy approximately  in foreign currencies at contracted rates 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges 
realized gains of  for and realized losses of  and  for and  respectively  from cash flow hedges were recorded in cost of goods sold 
realized gains of  and  for and  respectively  and realized losses of  for from cash flow hedges were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses due to hedge ineffectiveness 
realized losses of  for and realized gains of  for from forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
at december   the company did not have any forward foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify as hedges 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our operations or financial position relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short term borrowings on our working capital lines of credit 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company
