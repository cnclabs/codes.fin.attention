item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading online source of health insurance for individuals  families and small businesses 
our ecommerce platform enables individuals  families and small businesses to research  analyze  compare and purchase health insurance products that best meet their needs 
our technology also enables us to communicate electronically with our insurance carrier partners and process consumers health insurance applications online 
as a result  we simplify and streamline the complex and traditionally paper intensive health insurance sales and purchasing process 
since our incorporation in november  we have invested heavily in technology and content related to our ecommerce platform 
we have also invested significant time and resources in obtaining licenses to sell health insurance in all states and the district of columbia  developing diverse and successful member acquisition programs and establishing relationships with over leading insurance carriers  enabling us to offer thousands of health insurance products online 
our first online transaction relating to the sale of a health insurance policy was completed during the fourth quarter of we generate revenue primarily from commissions we receive from health insurance carriers whose policies are purchased through us by individuals  families and small businesses 
we typically receive commission payments on a monthly basis for as long as a policy remains active 
as a result  much of our revenue for a given financial reporting period relates to policies that we sold prior to the beginning of the period and is recurring in nature 
because health insurance pricing is set by the carrier and approved by state regulators  health insurance pricing is fixed 
we  therefore  are not generally subject to negotiation or discounting of health insurance prices by health insurance carriers or our competitors 
we recently determined to market medicare related health insurance products using our ecommerce platform  including medicare advantage  medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
we plan to offer medicare products to medicare eligible individuals  who are predominately senior citizens over the age of we determined to enter into the medicare product market  because we believe there is an increasing number of individuals becoming eligible for medicare and that medicare eligible individuals are increasingly using the internet to shop for health insurance products that supplement medicare 
we also believe that  on average  member retention rates and the commissions that health insurance carriers pay in connection with the sale of medicare products compare favorably to the member retention rates and commissions we receive in connection with our sale of individual and family health insurance 
the success of our entry into the market for medicare products will depend upon our ability to enter into and maintain relationships with health insurance carriers on favorable economic terms to market these products on our ecommerce platform 
as with our non medicare products  our revenue related to the marketing and sale of medicare products is expected to consist predominantly of commissions paid to us from these health insurance carriers 
we expect to invest approximately million  primarily in the customer care and enrollment and technology and content areas  in to support and grow our medicare business 
sources of revenue revenue we generate most of our revenue from commissions paid to us by health insurance carriers whose health insurance policies we have sold 
commission revenue represented  and of our total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the remainder of our revenue is primarily attributable to carrier sponsorship advertising on our website and licensing arrangements related to our technology 
we also refer to the licensing arrangements as ecommerce on demand  or eod  arrangements 
our commission revenue has grown principally as a result of our penetration of the individual and family health insurance market and corresponding growth in our membership 
we estimate that as of december  we had approximately  members compared to an estimated  members at december  we 
table of contents define a member as an individual covered by an insurance product for which we are entitled to receive compensation 
during the year ended december   the number of members approved for individual and family major medical health insurance products grew over the number of members that were approved during the year ended december  we recently have experienced slower year over year approved member growth  and we had fewer members approved in the quarter ended december  than were approved in the quarter ended december  our approved member growth has been impacted by slower growth in submitted applications for individual and family health insurance products  more stringent underwriting by our health insurance carrier partners with respect to individual and family health insurance applications  a decline in the average number of individuals per submitted application that were approved for individual and family health insurance and a decrease in the number of submitted applications for small business and short term health insurance products 
we believe that our individual and family health insurance submitted application growth rate may have been adversely impacted by several factors  including consumer confusion related to the timing and impact of potential federal health care reform legislation  weak macro economic conditions and the federal subsidy for health benefits under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of  or cobra 
the subsidy was implemented pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of and allows workers who are involuntarily terminated from employment between september and march  and otherwise eligible for cobra health benefits to receive a federal subsidy for cobra health benefits 
proposals in congress would extend the subsidy eligibility period through the end of if passed into law 
we believe that the factors that have impacted our individual and family health insurance submitted application growth rate have persisted into the first quarter of to the extent that they continue to persist  they may continue to adversely impact our growth 
our commission revenue generally represents a percentage of the insurance premium a member has paid to his or her insurance carrier and  to a lesser extent  commission override payments that insurance carriers pay us for achieving sales volume thresholds or other objectives 
commission rates vary by carrier and by the type of plan purchased by a member 
commission rates also can vary based upon the amount of time that the policy has been active  with commission rates for individual and family policies typically being higher in the first twelve months of the policy 
after the first twelve months  commission rates generally decline significantly 
as a result  if we do not add a sufficient number of members on new policies  our revenue growth will be negatively impacted 
individuals  families and small businesses purchasing health insurance through us typically pay their premiums on a monthly basis 
insurance carriers typically pay us our commissions monthly  after they receive the premium payment from the member 
we generally continue to receive the commission payment from the relevant insurance carrier until the health insurance policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy 
as a result  the majority of our revenue is recurring in nature and has grown in correlation with the growth we have experienced in our membership base 
we recognize commission revenue when our commission is reported to us by a health insurance carrier  net of an allowance for future forfeiture amounts payable to carriers due to policy cancellations 
commissions are reported to us by a cash payment and commission statement 
we generally receive these communications simultaneously 
in instances when we receive the cash payment and commission statement separately and in different accounting periods  we recognize revenue in the period that we receive the earliest communication  provided we receive the second communication corroborating the amount reported in the first communication within ten business days following the end of the accounting period 
if the second corroborating communication is not received within ten business days following the end of the accounting period  we recognize revenue in the period the second communication is received 
we use the data in the commission statement to identify the members for which we are receiving a commission payment and the amount received for each member  and to estimate our allowance for forfeitures 
commission override payments  which are recognized on the same basis as premium commissions  are generally reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
as a result  our revenue for a particular quarter could be higher or lower than expectations due to the timing of the reporting of commission override payments 
revenue attributable to individual and family product offerings represented approximately  and of our commission revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we define 
table of contents individual and family product offerings as major medical individual and family health insurance plans  which does not include small business  short term major medical  stand alone dental  life and student health insurance product offerings 
in addition to the commission revenue we derive from the sale of health insurance products  we derive revenue from our online sponsorship advertising program and from licensing the use of our ecommerce technology 
our sponsorship advertising program allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website 
in return  we are typically paid a monthly fee and a performance fee based on metrics such as submitted or approved health insurance applications 
our technology licensing business allows carriers to offer their own health insurance policies on their websites and agents to utilize our technology to power their online quoting  content and application submission processes 
typically  we are paid a one time implementation fee  which we recognize on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the customer relationship generally the initial term of the agreement  commencing once the technology is available for use by the third party 
in addition  we typically generate revenue based on performance criteria that are either measured based on data tracked by us  or based on data tracked by the third party 
in instances where the performance criteria data are tracked by us  we recognize revenue in the period of performance 
in instances where the performance criteria data are tracked by the third party  we recognize revenue when the amounts earned are both fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
typically  this occurs through our receipt of a cash payment from the third party along with a detailed statement containing the data that is tracked by the third party 
based on information currently available to us  we expect total revenue to increase in absolute dollars in compared to as a result of continued growth in our membership as well as growth in our sponsorship and licensing businesses 
member acquisition an important factor in our revenue growth is the growth of our member base 
our marketing initiatives are an important component of our strategy to grow our member base and are focused on three primary member acquisition channels direct  marketing partners and online advertising 
our marketing initiatives are designed to encourage consumers to complete an online application for health insurance on our ecommerce platform 
direct 
our direct member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website addresses www 
ehealth 
com and www 
ehealthinsurance 
com either directly or through algorithmic natural search listings on internet search engines and directories 
for each of the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance from our direct channel constituted  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
marketing partners 
our marketing partner member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website through a network of affiliate partners and financial services and other companies 
growth in our marketing partner channel depends upon our expanding marketing programs with existing partners and adding new partners to our network 
for the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance products from our marketing partner member acquisition channel constituted approximately  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
online advertising 
our online advertising member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website through paid keyword search advertising from search engines such as google  msn and yahoo  as well as various internet marketing programs such as banner advertising and email marketing 
for the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance products from our online advertising channel constituted approximately  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 

table of contents the number of applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the individual and family health insurance submitted application growth in the year ended december  was comprised of growth in our direct channel  growth in our marketing partner channel and growth in our online advertising channel 
we experienced slower individual and family health insurance submitted application growth in the second half of than we experienced in the first half of the year 
our individual and family health insurance submitted application growth was in the quarter ended december  compared to the quarter ended december  we believe that our individual and family health insurance submitted application growth rate may have been adversely impacted by several factors  including confusion relating to the timing and impact of potential healthcare reform legislation  weak macro economic conditions and the federal subsidy for health benefits under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of  or cobra 
operating costs and expenses cost of revenue sharing cost of revenue sharing consists primarily of payments made to health benefits direct corporation  or hbdc  as a result of a revenue sharing arrangement whereby we pay hbdc a percentage of the commission revenue we receive related to certain health insurance members that hbdc transferred to us and payments made to marketing partners related to health insurance policies sold to members who were referred to our website by marketing partners with whom we have revenue sharing arrangements 
in order to enter into a revenue sharing arrangement  these marketing partners must be licensed to sell health insurance in the state where the policy is sold 
costs related to revenue sharing arrangements are expensed as the related revenue is recognized 
we entered into customer transition and marketing agreements with hbdc in february pursuant to the agreements  hbdc agreed to transfer certain of its existing health insurance members to us as the new broker of record on the underlying policies and agreed to refer future health insurance prospects to us 
we paid hbdc initial consideration of million  which is being amortized to cost of revenue sharing expense as we recognize commission revenue related to the transferred members 
in addition  we agreed to pay hbdc a percentage of the commission revenue we receive on the transferred policies  as well as a percentage of the future commission revenue we receive on health insurance policies we sell to prospects hbdc refers to us 
the ongoing revenue sharing payments are also recognized as cost of revenue sharing expense 
during the year ended december   we became the broker of record on and recognized commission revenue from members transferred from hbdc  all of which were members on individual and family major medical policies 
we expect cost of revenue sharing expenses to decrease in absolute dollars in compared to as a result of an expected decrease in the amount of revenue sharing payments we will make to hbdc due to a decline in the number of commission generating members that were transferred to us from hbdc during  and due to a decrease in amortization expense related to the initial consideration paid to hbdc 
marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expenses consist primarily of member acquisition expenses associated with our direct  marketing partner and online advertising member acquisition channels  in addition to compensation and other expenses related to marketing  business development  partner management  public relations and carrier relations personnel who support our offerings 
our direct channel expenses primarily consist of television advertising  radio advertising  print advertising  direct mail  email and other activities that drive consumers directly to our website 
we compensate a significant number of our marketing partners by paying a one time fee each time a consumer referral from a partner results in a submitted health insurance application on our ecommerce platform  regardless of whether the consumer s application is approved by the health insurance carrier 
many of our marketing partners have tiered volume incentive arrangements in which the amount of the one time fee increases 
table of contents as the volume of submitted applications we receive from such marketing partners increases over a particular period 
we recognize these expenditures in the period when a marketing partner s referral results in the submission of a health insurance application on our website 
the number of health insurance applications submitted through our ecommerce platform has generally increased in our first quarter compared to our fourth quarter and in our third quarter compared to our second quarter 
conversely  we have generally experienced a decline or flattening in submitted applications in our second quarter compared to our first quarter and in our fourth quarter compared to our third quarter 
since a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses are driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted on our website  those expenses are influenced by these patterns 
in addition  because the total volume of submitted applications that we receive from our marketing partners is largely outside of our control  particularly during any short term period  and because of our tiered volume incentive marketing partner arrangements  we could incur expenses in excess of  or below  the amounts we had planned in periods of rapid change in the volume of submitted applications from marketing partner referrals 
an unanticipated increase in submitted applications resulting from marketing partner referrals could cause our net income to be lower than our expectation  since the revenue to be derived from submitted applications that are approved by health insurance carriers will not be recognized until future periods 
paid keyword search advertising on search engines represents the majority of expenses in our online advertising channel 
we incur expenses associated with search engine advertising in the period in which the consumer clicks on the advertisement 
our average cost of acquiring new members  if measured as total marketing and advertising expenses for the year divided by the number of individuals included on applications for individual and family health insurance submitted during the year  was in compared to in this increase was primarily driven by increased expenses in our online advertising channel due to increased cost per click in paid keyword search advertising for keywords relevant to our business  a decline in the rate at which individuals coming to our ecommerce platform through the online advertising channel submitted individual and family health insurance applications and a decline in the average number of individuals applying for individual and family health insurance per submitted application 
our cost of acquisition depends significantly on the rate at which visitors to our website submit health insurance applications  particularly with respect to paid search advertising  as our paid search costs are incurred on the referral of a potential member rather than on the submission of a health insurance application 
other factors that may impact the average cost of acquiring new members include the mix of health insurance applications submitted through our three marketing channels  the mix of marketing partners referring consumers to our website  the overall trend in costs of online marketing  seasonality patterns  the amounts we pay marketing partners to refer consumers to our website  television and radio advertising expenditures  and an increase in compensation and benefits costs for marketing and advertising personnel 
additionally  we may explore new marketing initiatives that increase per member acquisition costs as part of our efforts to drive more consumers to our website or increase our brand awareness 
we expect our marketing and advertising expenses to increase in absolute dollars in compared to due to an increase in our online marketing and advertising expenditures during  including paid keyword search advertising 
as a result  we expect the average cost of acquiring new members to be higher in compared to as a percentage of total revenue in  we expect our marketing and advertising expense to be equal to or higher than our expense as a percentage of total revenue 
customer care and enrollment customer care and enrollment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits costs for personnel engaged in pre sales assistance to applicants who call our customer care center and for enrollment personnel who assist applicants during the underwriting process 
we expect customer care and enrollment expenses to increase in absolute dollars in compared to as a result of additional personnel and to develop future medicare product sales capabilities 

table of contents technology and content technology and content expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits costs for personnel associated with developing and enhancing our website technology as well as maintaining our website 
a majority of our technology and content group is located at our wholly owned subsidiary in china  where technology development costs are generally lower than in the united states 
we expect technology and content expenses to increase in absolute dollars in compared to due to our continued focus on technology development  including the enhancement of our current ecommerce platform for medicare product capabilities 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits costs for staff working in our executive  finance  corporate development  investor relations  government relations  legal  human resources  internal audit  facilities and internal information technology departments 
these expenses also include fees paid for outside professional services  mainly for audit  tax  legal and information technology consulting 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in compared to due to the increased costs necessary to support the growth of our business

this metric may not reflect the true acquisition cost 
our insurance carrier partners bill and collect insurance premiums paid by our members 
carrier partners do not report to us the number of members that we have as of a given date 
the majority of our members who terminate their policies do so by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier and do not inform us of the cancellation 
also  some of our members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly 
given the number of months required to observe non payment of commissions in order to confirm cancellations  we estimate the number of members who are active on insurance policies as of a specified date 
we estimate the number of continuing members on non small business insurance policies as of a specific date by taking the sum of i the number of members for whom we have received a commission payment for the month that is six months or three months in the case of short term  student and dental insurance prior to the date of estimation after 
table of contents reducing that number using historical experience for assumed member cancellations over  as applicable  the three month or six month period  and ii the number of approved members over the six month period or three months in the case of short term  student and dental insurance prior to the date of estimation after reducing that number using historical experience for an assumed number of members who do not accept their approved policy and for estimated member cancellations through the date of the estimate 
we estimate the number of small business group members using the number of initial members at the time the group is approved  and we update this number for changes in membership if such changes are reported to us by the group or carrier in the period it is reported 
however  groups generally notify the carrier directly of policy cancellations and increases or decreases in group size without informing us 
additionally  our carrier partners often do not communicate this information to us 
we often are made aware of policy cancellations at the time of annual renewal and update our membership statistics accordingly in the period they are reported 
after we have estimated membership for a period  we may receive information from health insurance carriers that would have impacted the estimate if we had received the information prior to the date of estimation 
we may receive commission payments or other information that indicates that a member who was not included in our estimates for a prior period was in fact an active member at that time  or that a member who was included in our estimates was in fact not an active member of ours 
for instance  we reconcile information carriers provide to us and may determine that we were not historically paid commissions owed to us  which would cause us to have underestimated our membership 
conversely  carriers may require us to return commission payments paid in a prior period due to policy cancellations for members we previously estimated as being active 
we reflect updated information regarding our membership in the membership estimate for the current period that we are estimating  if applicable 
as a result of the delay in our receipt of information from insurance carriers  actual trends in our membership are most discernable over periods longer than from one quarter to the next 
in addition  and as a result of the delay we experience in receiving information about our membership  it is difficult for us to determine with any certainty the impact of current economic conditions on our membership retention 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the useful lives of long lived assets including property and equipment  fair value of investments  fair value of intangible assets  allowances for commission forfeitures payable to carriers  income taxes  the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation and our assessment whether internal use software and website development costs will result in additional functionality  among others 
we based our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize commission revenue when our commission is reported to us by a health insurance carrier  net of an allowance for future forfeiture amounts payable to carriers due to policy cancellations 
commissions are reported to us by a cash payment and commission statement 
we use the data in the commission statements to help identify the members for which we are receiving a commission payment and the amount received for each 
table of contents member  and to estimate our allowance for forfeitures payable to carriers 
as a result  we recognize the net amount of compensation earned as the agent in the transaction 
our insurance carrier partners bill and collect insurance premiums that our members pay 
we rely on health insurance carriers to report accurately and in a timely manner the amount of commissions earned by us  and we calculate our commission revenues  prepare our financial reports  projections and budgets  and direct our marketing and other operating efforts based on the reports we receive from them 
each month we analyze the reports we receive from our carriers by comparing such data to the database we maintain on our members 
it is often difficult for us to independently determine whether or not carriers are reporting all commissions due to us  primarily because the majority of our members who terminate their policies do so by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier instead of by informing us of the cancellation 
also  some of our members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly 
this results in our having to identify underpayment or non payment of commissions on a policy and follow up with a carrier to obtain an explanation and or request correction of the amount of commissions paid to us 
to date  we have not had disputes of any significance with carriers related to reported commissions 
to the extent that carriers understate or fail to timely and accurately report or pay the amount of commissions due to us  we will not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled  which  if material in amount  would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
commission override revenue  which we recognize on the same basis as premium commissions  is generally reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
as a result  our revenues for a particular quarter could be higher or lower than expectations due to the timing of the reporting of commission override revenue to us 
certain commission amounts are subject to forfeiture in circumstances where a member has prepaid his or her premium for a future period of coverage and subsequently cancels his or her policy before the completion of that period 
we estimate and record an allowance for these forfeitures based on historical cancellation experience using data provided on commission statements 
the forfeitures are typically reported to us by health insurance carriers one to two months after the commission is reported and paid to us by the carrier 
our estimate of the allowance for forfeitures includes an estimate of both the reporting time lag and the forfeiture amount 
changes in our historical trends would result in changes to our estimated forfeitures in future periods 
there were no changes in our average forfeiture rates or reporting time lag during the years ended december   and which had a material impact on our allowance for forfeitures 
in addition to the commission revenue we derive from the sale of health insurance products  we derive revenue from our online sponsorship advertising program and from licensing the use of our ecommerce technology 
our sponsorship advertising program allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website 
in return  we are typically paid a monthly fee  which is recognized over the period that advertising is displayed  and often a performance fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
our technology licensing business allows carriers the use of our ecommerce platform to offer their own health insurance policies on their websites and agents to utilize our technology to power their online quoting  content and application submission processes 
typically  we are paid a one time implementation fee  which we recognize on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the customer relationship generally the initial term of the agreement  commencing once the technology is available for use by the third party  and a performance fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
the metrics used to calculate performance fees for both sponsorship advertising and technology licensing are based on performance criteria that are either measured based on data tracked by us  or based on data tracked by the third party 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by us  we recognize revenue in the period of performance 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by the third party  we recognize revenue when the amounts earned are both fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
typically  this occurs through our receipt of a cash payment from the third party along with a detailed statement containing the data that is tracked by the third party 

table of contents deferred revenue consists of deferred technology licensing implementation fees as well as amounts collected from sponsorship or technology licensing customers in advance of our performing our service for such customers 
we also defer amounts that have been reported to us related to transactions where our services are complete  but where we cannot currently estimate the allowance for future forfeitures related to those amounts 
internal use software and website development costs we capitalize costs of materials  consultants and compensation and benefits costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software  however  we usually expense as incurred website development costs for new features and functionalities because it is not probable that they will result in additional functionality until they are both developed and tested with confirmation that they are more effective than the current set of features and functionalities on our website 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the states at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  which is generally three years 
to the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our website  assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  the amount of website development costs we capitalize and amortize in future periods would be impacted 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based on the fair value of our stock based awards over their respective vesting periods  which is generally four years 
the grant date fair value of our stock based awards is determined using the black scholes merton pricing model and a single option award approach 
the weighted average expected term for stock options granted is calculated using the simplified method  as we do not have sufficient historical option exercise behavior on which to estimate expected terms 
the simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period of the stock option 
we have estimated the volatility used as an input to the model based on an analysis of our stock price since our initial public offering in october  as well as an analysis of similar public companies for which we have data 
we estimate our expected volatility using the weighted average of our implied volatility  our mean reversion volatility  and the mean reversion volatility of similar public companies for which we have data 
we have used judgment in selecting these companies  as well as evaluating the available historical and implied volatility data for these companies 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term and volatility related to our own stock based awards on a prospective basis  and incorporating these factors into the model 
changes in key assumptions will significantly impact the valuation of such instruments 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded stock based compensation expense totaling million  million and million  respectively  related to stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted to employees 
future stock based compensation expense is dependent upon the fair value of each option at the date each option is granted and the number of awards issued and outstanding during each period 
we expect stock based compensation expense will increase in the future as the number of equity awards issued and outstanding increases 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

table of contents since tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements 
because we assume that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  which gives rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet the more likely than not criteria  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we were able to develop expectations of future taxable income and estimate other relevant factors sufficiently in the future to conclude that it was more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reversed our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets  as well as discrete tax items during the period  such as excess tax benefits related to share based payments 
our effective tax rate in was higher than statutory federal and state tax rates primarily due to non deductible lobbying expenses and tax shortfalls related to share based payments  partially offset by an income tax adjustment related to an increase in our deferred income tax assets resulting from a reduction in estimated limitations on both our federal and california net operating loss carry forwards 
our effective tax rate in was higher than statutory federal and state tax rates primarily due to tax shortfalls related to share based payments  as well as penalties and interest associated with our unrecognized tax benefits 
our effective tax rate in differed from the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the releases of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in that year 
in september  the state of california approved its budget for fiscal year ending june   which contained changes to the california tax law which substantially limited our ability to utilize available state net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards to reduce our state income taxes payable 
under the new tax law  the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards was suspended for tax years and  however  the expiration date of the net operating loss carry forwards was extended for an equivalent two year period 
additionally  for tax years and  taxpayers may only utilize available tax credit carry forwards to reduce their current tax liability up to of their net tax amount before application of such credits 
the new law does not affect the amount of net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards that we expect to ultimately use to offset future california taxes  however  it did limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards that we were able to utilize to reduce our taxes payable during and  resulting in an increase in cash taxes paid to the state of california in and while this change in the california tax law did not impact our effective tax rate  our cash outlay for federal and state taxes increased to approximately of pre tax income in compared to of pre tax income and is expected to be approximately to of pre tax income in assuming the state of california does not extend the suspension of the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards 
we consider stock option deduction benefits in excess of book compensation charges realized when we obtain an incremental benefit determined by the with and without calculation method 
under the with and without approach  excess tax benefits related to share based payments are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
for example  net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards from prior years are used to reduce taxes currently payable prior to deductions from stock option exercises for purposes of financial reporting  while for tax return purposes  current year stock compensation deductions are generally used before net operating loss carry forwards 
indirect effects of excess tax benefits  such as the effect on research and development tax credits  are not considered 
realized excess tax benefits are reflected in the financial statements 

table of contents due to the restriction on our ability to utilize net operating loss carry forwards to reduce taxes currently payable in california as well as the expected utilization of our remaining federal net operating losses during and  we utilized excess tax benefits related to share based payments and other unrecognized tax benefits  which increased additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets million and million as of december  and  respectively  and increased other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets million and million as of december  and  respectively 
additionally  the realized excess tax benefits related to share based payments in and are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows as both a financing cash inflow and an operating cash outflow 
we expect to continue utilizing excess tax benefits related to share based payments and other unrecognized tax benefits in future changes in various factors  such as the amount of stock based compensation we record during the period and the related tax benefit we realize upon the exercise of employee stock options  potential limitations on the use of our federal and state net operating loss credit carry forwards  pending or future tax law changes including rate changes and the tax benefit from or limitations on our ability to utilize research and development credits  changes in our valuation allowance and state and foreign taxes  would impact our estimates  and as a result  could affect our effective tax rate and the amount of income tax expense we record  and pay  in future periods 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits 
as of december  and  there were million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  that  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
due to net operating losses  all tax years after are open to examination and adjustment 
fair value measurements we define fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we classify the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability we endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value of our assets  and as such  use market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
we have determined that our financial assets are classified as either level or level in the fair value hierarchy as of december  in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements

the timing of the recognition of our commission revenue depends upon the timing of our receipt of commission reports and associated commission payments from health insurance carriers 
if we were to experience a delay in receiving a commission payment from a health insurance carrier at the end of a quarter  our operating cash flows for that quarter could be negatively impacted 
additionally  commission override payments are reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
for example  a carrier may make a commission override payment to us on an annual basis  which would positively impact our cash flows in the quarter the payment is received 
the majority of our annual commission override payments are typically received during the first quarter of the year 
historically  we have experienced a reduction in operating cash flows during the first quarter of the year due to the payment of annual performance bonuses to employees 
in addition  a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses are driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted on our ecommerce platform 
since our marketing and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and the revenue from approved applications is recognized as commissions are subsequently reported to us  our operating cash flows could be negatively impacted by a substantial increase in the volume of applications submitted during a quarter or positively impacted by a substantial decline in the volume of applications submitted during a quarter

future needs we believe that cash generated from operations and our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months

during the years ended december   and  net unrealized gains and losses incurred on our marketable securities were not significant  and  as of december  and  we carried immaterial net unrealized gains on our marketable securities  which are reported as a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets and comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
unrealized gains and losses are the result of the change in fair value of our investments in marketable securities  primarily us government sponsored enterprise bonds and discount notes and corporate bonds  at the beginning and end of the period 
we did not realize any losses on our marketable securities during the years ended december   and we do not require collateral or other security for our accounts receivable 
as of december   two carriers represented million  or  of our total accounts receivable 
no other carrier represented or more of our total accounts receivable 
we believe the potential for collection issues with any of our carriers is minimal 
accordingly  our allowance for uncollectible amounts at december  was not material
