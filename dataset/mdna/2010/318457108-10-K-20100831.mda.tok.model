table of contents first acceptance corporation k general we are principally a retailer  servicer and underwriter of non standard personal automobile insurance 
we also own two tracts of land in san antonio  texas that are held for sale 
non standard personal automobile insurance is made available to individuals who are categorized as non standard because of their inability or unwillingness to obtain standard insurance coverage due to various factors  including payment history  payment preference  failure in the past to maintain continuous insurance coverage  driving record and or vehicle type 
generally  our customers are required by law to buy a minimum amount of automobile insurance 
at august   we leased and operated retail locations or stores staffed by employee agents who primarily sell non standard personal automobile insurance products underwritten by us as well as certain commissionable ancillary products 
in certain states  our employee agents also sell other complementary insurance products underwritten by us 
at august   we wrote non standard personal automobile insurance in states and were licensed in additional states

policies in force increase as a result of new policies issued and decrease as a result of policies that are canceled or expire and are not renewed 
year ended june  policies in force beginning of period net decrease during period policies in force end of period insurance companies present a combined ratio as a measure of their overall underwriting profitability 
the components of the combined ratio are as follows 
loss ratio loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability 
we calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned 
expense ratio expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of insurance operating expenses to premiums earned 
insurance operating expenses are reduced by commission and fee income from insureds 
this is a measurement that illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations 
combined ratio combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income 
the following table presents the loss  expense and combined ratios for our insurance operations 
year ended june  loss and loss adjustment expense expense combined the non standard personal automobile insurance industry is cyclical in nature 
likewise  adverse economic conditions impact our customers and many will choose to reduce their coverage or go uninsured during a weak economy 
investments we use the services of an independent investment manager to manage our investment portfolio

the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries consist substantially of marketable  investment grade  us government securities  municipal bonds  corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
we also invest a portion of the portfolio in certain securities issued by political subdivisions  which enable our insurance company subsidiaries to obtain premium tax credits 
investment income is comprised primarily of interest earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
realized gains and losses may occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings based upon changes in interest rates or the credit quality of specific securities

the average credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was aa at june  investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and have lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non investment grade 
we believe that a high quality investment portfolio is more likely to generate a stable and predictable investment return 
investments in cmos had a fair value of million at june  and represented of our fixed maturity portfolio 
at june   of our cmos were considered investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies 
in addition  of our cmos were rated aaa and of our cmos were backed by agencies of the united states government

table of contents first acceptance corporation k other than temporary impairment effective april   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments prior authoritative literature fasb staff position no 
fas 
under this guidance  we separate other than temporary impairment otti into the following two components i the amount related to credit losses  which is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and ii the amount related to all other factors  which is recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the credit related portion of an otti is measured by comparing a security s amortized cost to the present value of its current expected cash flows discounted at its effective yield prior to the impairment charge 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
we routinely monitor our fixed maturity portfolio for changes in fair value that might indicate potential impairments and perform detailed reviews on such securities 
changes in fair value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer or ii market related factors such as interest rates or sector declines 
securities with declines attributable to issuer specific fundamentals are reviewed to identify all available evidence to estimate the potential for impairment 
resources used include historical financial data included in filings with the sec for corporate bonds and performance data regarding the underlying loans for cmos 
securities with declines attributable solely to market or sector declines where we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before the full recovery of its amortized cost basis are not deemed to be other than temporary 
the issuer specific factors considered in reaching the conclusion that securities with declines are not other than temporary include i the extent and duration of the decline in fair value  including the duration of any significant decline in value  ii whether the security is current as to payments of principal and interest  iii a valuation of any underlying collateral  iv current and future conditions and trends for both the business and its industry  v changes in cash flow assumptions for cmos and vi rating agency actions 
based on these factors  we make a determination as to the probability of recovering principal and interest on the security 
on a quarterly basis  we review cash flow estimates for certain non agency backed cmos of lesser credit quality following the guidance of fasb asc  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
prior authoritative literature fsp eitf fasb asc 
accordingly  when changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual or estimated prepayment or credit loss experience  and the present value of the revised cash flows is less than the present value previously estimated  otti is deemed to have occurred 
for non agency backed cmos not subject to fasb asc  we review quarterly projected cash flow analyses and recognize otti when it is determined that a loss is probable 
we have recognized otti related to certain non agency backed cmos as the underlying cash flows have been adversely impacted due to a reduction in prepayments from mortgage refinancing and an increase in actual and projected delinquencies in the underlying mortgages 
our review of non agency backed cmos included an analysis of available information such as collateral quality  anticipated cash flows  credit enhancements  default rates  loss severities  the securities relative position in their respective capital structures and credit ratings from statistical rating agencies 
we review quarterly projected cash flow analyses for each security utilizing current assumptions regarding i actual and anticipated delinquencies  ii delinquency transition to default rates and iii loss severities 
based on our quarterly reviews  we determined that there had not been an adverse change in projected cash flows  except in the case of those securities discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements which incurred otti charges of million for the year ended june  we believe that the unrealized losses on these securities are not necessarily predictive of the ultimate performance of the underlying collateral 
we do not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis 
the otti charges on corporate bonds during the year ended june  were recorded as these bonds were considered to be impaired based on the extent and duration of the declines in their fair values and issuer specific fundamentals relating to i poor operating results and weakened financial conditions  ii negative industry trends further impacted by the recent economic decline and iii a series of downgrades to their credit ratings 
based 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k on the factors that existed at the time of impairment  we did not believe that these bonds would recover their unrealized losses in the near future 
we believe that the remaining securities having unrealized losses at june  were not other than temporarily impaired 
we also do not intend to sell any of these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell any of these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis

the closure of underperforming stores also contributed toward the decrease in premiums earned 
approximately of the million decline in premiums earned for the year ended june  was in our alabama  florida  georgia  south carolina and texas markets

at june   we operated stores  compared with stores at june  commission and fee income commission and fee income decreased to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease in commission and fee income was a result of the decrease in the number of policies in force  partially offset by higher fee income related to commissionable ancillary products sold through our retail locations 
investment income investment income decreased to million during the year ended june  from million during the year ended june  the decrease in investment income was primarily a result of the sale of fixed maturity investments in fiscal year to generate taxable income to utilize expiring nols and the reduced yields obtained

loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was for the year ended june   compared with for the year ended june  we experienced favorable development related to prior periods of million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june  the favorable development for the year ended june  was due to i lower than anticipated severity of accidents occurring during the fiscal and accident years  primarily in bodily injury coverage in georgia and south carolina  ii an improvement in our claim handling practices and iii a shift in business mix toward renewal policies  which have lower loss ratios than new policies 
the favorable development for the year ended june  was primarily due to both lower than anticipated severity and frequency of accidents  most notably in our property and physical damage coverages 
excluding the favorable development related to prior periods  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios for the years ended june  and were and  respectively 
the year over year increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was due to higher frequency of accidents experienced during the first half of calendar year operating expenses insurance operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in costs such as employee agent commissions and premium taxes that varied along with the decrease in premiums earned as well as savings realized from the closure of underperforming stores 
the expense ratio increased from for the year ended june  to for fiscal year the year over year increase in the expense ratio was due to the decrease in premiums earned  which resulted in a higher percentage of fixed expenses in our retail operations such as rent and base salary 
overall  the combined ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  litigation settlement litigation settlement costs for the year ended june  were million  compared with million for fiscal year the reduction in expense during the year ended june  related primarily to the forfeiture of premium credits by georgia and alabama class members 
the year ended june  included costs incurred in connection with our settlement and defense of the litigation as described further in note to our consolidated financial statements  a million insurance recovery from our insurance carrier regarding coverage for the costs and expenses we incurred relating to the settlement  and reductions in expense related to the forfeiture of premium credits by georgia and alabama class members 
pursuant to the terms of the settlements  eligible class members are entitled to certain premium credits towards a future automobile insurance policy with the company or a reimbursement certificate for future rental or towing expenses 
benefits to the georgia and alabama class members commenced january  and march  
table of contents first acceptance corporation k  respectively 
any premium credits issued to class members as described above will be prorated over a twelve month term not to extend beyond august  and the class members will be entitled to the prorated premium credit only so long as their insurance premiums remain current during the twelve month term 
at december   we accrued million for premium credits available to class members who were actively insured by the company 
the following is a progression of the activity associated with the estimated premium credit liability in thousands 
balance at december  credits utilized credits forfeited balance at june  credits utilized credits forfeited balance at june  we have not established an accrual for million in potential premium credits available to class members who were not actively insured by the company upon commencement of the settlement due to the uncertainty associated with this group having to purchase a new automobile insurance policy 
we did not incur any significant costs associated with the reimbursement certificates 
the final costs of the settlements will depend on  among other factors  the rate of redemption and forfeiture of the premium credits and reimbursement certificates 
the litigation settlement costs are classified in the litigation settlement expenses line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
the litigation settlement accrual for those currently estimable costs associated with the utilization of premium credits is classified in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
based on the maximum remaining available premium credits  we do not expect any material adjustments during future periods 
for additional information with respect to the litigation settlements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment we recorded a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal year of million 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts  and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of those assets and liabilities  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment  if any  by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
as a result of the adverse impact of difficult economic conditions on our customers and business and the resulting decline in the company s share price during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we estimated that a goodwill impairment charge at june  was probable 
accordingly  we recognized an estimated non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to the complexity of the fair value calculations involved  the analysis of the goodwill impairment charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal year was finalized during the first quarter of fiscal year and the amount of the impairment did not differ from the initial estimate 
the goodwill impairment charge did not have a materially adverse impact on the continuing operations  liquidity  or statutory surplus of the company 
as a part of the company s annual impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of such assets at june   the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the company s reporting unit  from a market participant s perspective  included i long term revenue growth rates ranging from to  ii discount rates between and  which were based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with its operations and iii recent industry transaction trends in price to tangible book multiples and related returns on tangible equity 
based on this evaluation  the company concluded that goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were fully realizable as of june  our evaluation includes multiple 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k assumptions  including estimated discounted cash flows and other estimates that may change over time 
if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by us  further impairment charges may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as quoted market prices in active stock markets are relevant evidence of fair value  a significant decline in our common stock trading price may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for fiscal year the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  related to current state income taxes for certain subsidiaries with taxable income 
at june  and  we established a full valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets 
in assessing our ability to support the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered both positive and negative evidence 
we placed greater weight on historical results than on our outlook for future profitability 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be adjusted in future periods if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is adjusted  we would record an income tax benefit for the adjustment 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  included the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets which  in combination with the tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge  resulted in a net increase in the tax provision of million during the three months ended june  this charge was partially offset by a million tax benefit related to the utilization of tax nol carryforwards expiring in that had been previously reserved for through a valuation allowance resulting in a net increase in the tax provision for the year of million

a variance in the discount rate could have had a significant effect on the amount of the estimated goodwill impairment charge recognized 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have caused an increase or decrease in the estimated goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for the same period in fiscal year at june   we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets which  in combination with the tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge  resulted in a net increase in the tax provision of million during the three months ended june  this charge was partially offset by a million tax benefit related to the utilization of tax nol carryforwards expiring in that had been previously reserved for through a valuation allowance resulting in a net increase in the tax provision for the year of million

the naic model act for rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of statutory capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
there are statutory guidelines that suggest that on an annual calendar year basis  the insurance company subsidiaries should not exceed a ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus of to based on our current forecast of statutory capital and surplus and net premiums written  we anticipate our ratio will be approximately to for the reasonably foreseeable future 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows as noted above  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs  for both the holding company and our insurance company subsidiaries  in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
any future growth strategy may require external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain external financing 
we cannot assure that additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  or that any such financing would not negatively impact our results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes all of our contractual obligations by period at june  in thousands 
payments due by period more than total less than year years years years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves debentures payable capitalized lease obligations operating leases litigation settlement other total contractual cash obligations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not have contractual maturity dates  however  based on historical payment patterns  the amount presented is our estimate of the expected timing of these payments 
the timing of these payments is subject to significant uncertainty 
we maintain a portfolio of marketable investments with varying maturities and a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents intended to provide adequate cash flows for such payments 
payments due by period assume a contractual fixed interest rate of until july   after which the rate becomes variable libor plus basis points  or at june  
consists primarily of rental obligations under real estate leases related to our retail locations and corporate offices

trust preferred securities on june   first acceptance statutory trust i fast i  our wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust entity  completed a private placement whereby fast i issued  shares of preferred securities at  per share to outside investors and  shares of common securities to us  also at  per share 
fast i used the proceeds from the sale of the preferred securities to purchase million of junior subordinated debentures from us 
the debentures will mature on july  and are redeemable by the company in whole or in part beginning on july   at which time the preferred securities are callable 
the debentures pay a fixed rate of until july   after which the rate becomes variable libor plus basis points 
the obligations of the company under the junior subordinated debentures represent full and unconditional guarantees by the company of fast i s obligations for the preferred securities 
dividends on the preferred securities are cumulative  payable quarterly in arrears and are deferrable at the company s option for up to five years 
the dividends on these securities are the same as the interest on the debentures 
the company cannot pay dividends on its common stock during any such deferments 
fast i does not meet the requirements for consolidation of fasb asc  variable interest entities prior authoritative literature fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

for additional information with respect to our operating leases  see contractual obligations above and note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
the following are considered to be our critical accounting estimates 
valuation of deferred tax asset we maintain income taxes in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes prior authoritative literature fasb sfas no 
 whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting estimate because the determination of our ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value and  therefore  the carrying amount of our deferred tax asset 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are attributable to our insurance operations and were initially recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not amortized for financial statement purposes 
we are required to perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform our annual impairment tests as of the last day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may be impaired  an interim impairment test would be required 
intangible assets with finite lives have been fully amortized over their useful lives 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts  and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of those assets and liabilities  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment  if any  by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
our evaluation includes multiple assumptions  including estimated discounted cash flows and other estimates that may change over time 
if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by us  further impairment charges may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as quoted market prices in active stock markets are relevant evidence of fair value  a significant decline in our common stock trading price may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
investments our investments are recorded at fair value  which is typically based on publicly available quoted prices 
from time to time  the carrying value of our investments may be temporarily impaired because of the inherent volatility of publicly traded investments 
management reviews investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
a decline in the fair value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary would result in a charge against income for the credit related portion of any such impairment 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
we routinely monitor our investment portfolio for changes in fair value that might indicate potential impairments and perform detailed reviews on such securities 
changes in fair value are 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer or ii market related factors such as interest rates or sector declines 
securities with declines attributable to issuer specific fundamentals are reviewed to identify all available evidence to estimate the potential for impairment 
resources used include historical financial data included in sec filings for corporate bonds and performance data regarding the underlying loans for cmos 
securities with declines attributable solely to market or sector declines where we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis are not deemed to be other than temporary 
losses and loss adjustment expense reserves loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to events that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not been paid 
months and potentially years may elapse between the occurrence of an automobile accident covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the accident and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for accidents that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
as accidents are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for accidents that have occurred but have not been reported 
we are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies that our insurance company subsidiaries underwrite 
each of our insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for all of its unpaid losses  including case reserves and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we estimate our ibnr reserves by estimating our ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves first  and then reducing that amount by the amount of cumulative paid claims and by the amount of our case reserves 
we rely primarily on historical loss experience in determining reserve levels  on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience 
we also consider various other factors  such as inflation  claims settlement patterns  legislative activity and litigation trends 
our actuarial staff continually monitors these estimates on a state and coverage level 
we utilize our actuarial staff to determine appropriate reserve levels 
as experience develops or new information becomes known  we increase or decrease the level of our reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
see item business loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for additional information

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is exposed primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates  generally  the fair value of fixed income investments moves inversely with movements in market interest rates 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
likewise  the underlying investments of our current mutual fund investment are also fixed income investments 
this portfolio composition allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of our insurance company subsidiaries are managed to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
interest rate risk the fair values of our fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair values of those instruments 
additionally  the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates resulting from parallel shifts in market yield curves on our fixed maturity portfolio in thousands 
it is assumed that the effects are realized immediately upon the change in interest rates 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table
