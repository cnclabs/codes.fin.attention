doral bank had traditionally been a leading player in puerto rico in providing interim construction loans to finance residential development projects  primarily in the affordable and mid range housing markets 
in  the company reassessed its risk exposure to the sector and made a strategic decision to restrict construction lending to established clients with proven track records

for more information on doral financial s loan origination channels  refer to table f loan origination sources in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 

table of contents mortgage loan underwriting doral bank pr s underwriting standards are designed to comply with the relevant guidelines set forth by the department of housing and urban development hud  gnma  rhs  va  fnma  fhlmc  federal and puerto rico banking regulatory authorities  private mortgage investment conduits and private mortgage insurers  as applicable 
doral bank pr s underwriting policies focus primarily on the borrower s ability to pay and secondarily on collateral value 
the maximum loan to value ratio on conventional first mortgages generally does not exceed 
doral bank pr also offers certain first mortgage products with higher loan to value ratios  which may require private mortgage insurance 
in conjunction with a first mortgage  doral bank pr may also provide a borrower with additional financing through a closed end second mortgage loan  whose combined loan to value ratio exceeds

these scores are supplied by credit information providers  based on statistical models that summarize an individual s credit record 
fico scores  developed by fair isaac corporation  are the most commonly used credit scores 
doral bank pr sells the majority of its conforming mortgage loan originations and retains the majority of its non conforming loan originations in portfolio 
the company s underwriting process is established to achieve a uniform rules based standard while targeting high quality non conforming loan originations which is consistent with the company s goal of retaining a greater portion of its mortgage loan production 
mortgage loan servicing when doral financial sells originated or purchased mortgage loans  it generally retains the right to service such loans and to receive the associated servicing fees 
doral financial s principal source of servicing rights has traditionally been its mortgage loan production 
doral financial also seeks to purchase servicing rights in bulk when it can identify attractive opportunities 
in july of  all servicing operations were transferred to doral bank pr 
the company believes that loan servicing for third parties is important to its asset liability management tool because it provides an asset whose value in general tends to move in the opposite direction to the value of its loan and investment portfolio 
the asset also provides additional fee income to help offset the cost of its mortgage operations 
servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans 
failure to service the loans in accordance with contract requirements may lead to the termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 
in general  doral bank pr s servicing agreements are terminable by the investors for cause 
however  certain servicing arrangements  such as those with fnma and fhlmc  contain termination provisions that may be triggered by changes in the servicer s financial condition that materially and adversely affect its ability to provide satisfactory servicing of the loans 
as of december   approximately  and of doral financial s mortgage loans serviced for others related to mortgage servicing for fnma  fhlmc and gnma  respectively 
as of december   doral bank pr serviced approximately billion in mortgage loans on behalf of third parties 
termination of doral bank pr s servicing rights by any of these agencies could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s results of operations and financial condition 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with this type of servicing arrangement is evaluated solely based on ancillary income  float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
doral bank pr s mortgage loan servicing portfolio is subject to reduction by reason of normal amortization  prepayments and foreclosure of outstanding mortgage loans 
additionally  doral bank pr may sell mortgage loan servicing rights from time to time to other institutions if market conditions are favorable 
for additional information regarding the composition of doral financial s servicing portfolio as of each of the company s last three fiscal year ends  please refer to table g loans serviced for third parties in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 

table of contents the degree of credit risk associated with a mortgage loan servicing portfolio is largely dependent on the extent to which the servicing portfolio is non recourse or recourse 
in non recourse servicing  the principal credit risk to the servicer is the cost of temporary advances of funds 
in recourse servicing  the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans  such as fnma or fhlmc  or with a private investor  insurer or guarantor 
losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of such mortgage loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property 
prior to  doral financial often sold non conforming loans on a partial recourse basis 
these recourse obligations were retained by doral financial when doral bank pr assumed the servicing rights from doral financial 
for additional information regarding recourse obligations  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  off balance sheet activities in this report 
sale of loans and securitization activities doral financial sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates and purchases to generate income 
these loans are underwritten to investor standards  including that of fnma  fhlmc  and gnma 
as described below  doral financial utilizes various channels to sell its mortgage products 
doral financial issues gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities  which involve the packaging of fha  rhs or va loans into pools of million or more for sale primarily to broker dealers and other institutional investors 
during the years ended december   and  doral financial issued approximately million  million and million  respectively  in gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
conforming conventional loans are generally either sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or private investors for cash  or are grouped into pools of million or more in aggregate principal balance and exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells to broker dealers 
in connection with such exchanges  doral financial pays guarantee fees to fnma and fhlmc 
the issuance of mortgage backed securities provides doral financial with flexibility in selling the mortgage loans that it originates or purchases and also provides income by increasing the value and marketability of such loans 
for the years ended december   and  doral financial securitized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans into fnma and fhlmc mortgage backed securities 
in addition  for the years ended december   and  doral financial sold approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans through the fnma and fhlmc cash window programs 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized they are treated as sales and the company continues to service the underlying loans 
the company is required to bring individual delinquent gnma loans that it previously accounted for as sold back onto its books as loan assets when  under the gnma mortgage backed securities guide  the loan meets gnma s specified delinquency criteria and is eligible for repurchase 
the rebooking of gnma loans is required together with a liability for the same amount regardless of whether the bank  as seller servicer  intends to exercise the repurchase buy back option since the company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
at december  and  the loans held for sale portfolio includes million and million  respectively  related to defaulted loans backing gnma securities for which the company has an unconditional option but not an obligation to repurchase 
payment on these loans is guaranteed by fha 
in december  the company repurchased million of gnma defaulted loans 
these loans were classified as held for investment 
prior to the fourth quarter of  doral financial s non conforming loan sales were generally made on a limited recourse basis 
as of december   and  doral financial s maximum contractual exposure relating to its portfolio of loans sold with recourse was approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  which included recourse obligations to fnma and fhlmc as of such dates of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   and  doral financial had a recourse liability of million  million and million  respectively  to reflect estimated losses from such recourse arrangements 
during  doral financial refined its estimate for determining expected losses from recourse obligations as it began to develop more data regarding historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted 
table of contents for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
this actual data on losses showed a substantially different experience than that used for newer loans for which insurance quotes are published 
the company believes that this method resulted in an adequate valuation of its recourse allowance as of december  and  but actual future recourse obligations may be different and a different result may have been obtained if the company had used another method for estimating this liability 
in the past the company sold non conforming loans to major financial institutions in the us mainland on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early defaults 
since the company is retaining all of its non conforming loan production in its loan receivable portfolio 
while the company currently anticipates that it will continue to retain its non conforming loan production in portfolio  in the future  the company may seek to continue to diversify secondary market outlets for its non conforming loan products both in the us mainland and puerto rico 
in the ordinary course of business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans at the time of the loans sales to third parties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold  and in certain circumstances  such as in the event of early or first payment default 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics  if there is a breach of contract of a representation or warranty or if there is an early payment default  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan 
doral financial works with purchasers to review the claims and correct alleged documentation deficiencies 
for the years ended december   and repurchases amounted to million  million and million  respectively

puerto rico secondary mortgage market and favorable tax treatment in general  the puerto rico market for mortgage backed securities is an extension of the us market with respect to pricing  rating of investment instruments  and other matters 
however  doral financial has benefited historically from certain tax incentives provided to puerto rico residents to invest in fha and va loans and gnma securities backed by such loans 
under the puerto rico internal revenue code of the pr code  the interest received on fha and va loans used to finance the original purchase of newly constructed housing in puerto rico and mortgage backed securities backed by such loans is exempt from puerto rico income taxes 
this favorable tax treatment allows doral financial to sell tax exempt puerto rico gnma mortgage backed securities to local investors at higher prices than those at which comparable instruments trade in the us mainland  and reduces its effective tax rate through the receipt of tax exempt interest

doral insurance agency s activities are closely integrated with the company s mortgage loan originations with most policies sold to mortgage customers

governmental responsibilities assumed by the central government of puerto rico are similar in nature to those of the various state governments 
in addition  the central government of puerto rico assumes responsibility for local police and fire protection  education  public health and welfare programs  and economic development 
the economy 
the economy of puerto rico is closely linked to that of the mainland united states 
most of the external factors that affect the puerto rico economy other than the price of oil are determined by the policies of  and economic conditions prevailing in  the united states 
these external factors include exports  direct investment  the amount of federal transfer payments  the level of interest rates  the rate of inflation  and tourist expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately of puerto rico s exports went to the us mainland  which was also the source of approximately of puerto rico s imports 
in the past  the economy of puerto rico has generally followed economic trends in the overall united states economy 
however  in recent years  economic growth in puerto rico has lagged behind growth in the united states 
the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy in terms of production and income are manufacturing and services 
the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of an increased emphasis on higher wage  high technology industries  such as pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  computers  microprocessors  professional and scientific instruments  and certain high technology machinery and equipment 
the services sector  including finance  insurance  real estate  wholesale and retail trade  and tourism  also plays a major role in the economy 
it ranks second to manufacturing in contribution to puerto rico s gross domestic product and leads all sectors in providing employment 
puerto rico s economy is currently in a recession that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that ended june   a fiscal year in which puerto rico s real gross national product grew by only 
for fiscal years and  puerto rico s real gross national product contracted by and  respectively 
according to the latest information published by the puerto rico planning board the planning board in january  the contraction continued into fiscal year with a reduction in puerto rico s real gross national product of 
while the recessionary trend was expected to continue in current fiscal year  the planning board announced in august that the expected positive impact of the united states and local economic stimulus measures generally discussed below should outweigh the expected negative impact of the fiscal stabilization plan also discussed below  and revised its projections for fiscal year to reflect an increase of in puerto rico s real gross national product 
the revised forecast also considers the effect on the puerto rico economy of general global economic conditions  the us economy  the volatility of oil prices  interest rates and the behavior of local exports  including expenditures by visitors 
the planning board  however  is currently working on a revised fiscal year gross national product forecast that would take into account the recently announced preliminary results for fiscal year  the economic impact of a delay in the disbursement of funds from the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  and other economic factors that may require a downward revision of their projection 
the revised projection may show a continued reduction in gross national product during fiscal year the planning board expects to complete and announce the revised projection during the first quarter of future growth of the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the united states economy  the relative stability of the price of oil imports  the exchange value of the united states dollar  the level of interest rates  the effectiveness of the recently approved changes to local tax incentive legislation  and the continuing economic uncertainty generated by the puerto rico government s fiscal condition described below 

table of contents fiscal condition 
the puerto rico government is experiencing a fiscal crisis as a result of the structural imbalance between recurring government revenues and expenses 
the structural imbalance was exacerbated during fiscal years and  with recurring government expenses significantly higher than recurring revenues  which have declined as a result of the multi year economic contraction mentioned above 
in order to bridge the deficit resulting from the structural imbalance  the puerto rico government has used non recurring solutions  such as borrowing from government development bank for puerto rico gdb or in the bond market  and postponing the payment of various government expenses  such as payments to suppliers and utilities providers 
the structural deficit for fiscal year was estimated to be billion 
rating downgrades 
the continued fiscal imbalance led to successive downgrades in the commonwealth of puerto rico s general obligation debt ratings  from baa by moody s and a by s p in fiscal year to baa by moody s and bbb by s p currently 
each of the rating agencies has a stable outlook on the commonwealth s general obligation debt 
fiscal stabilization plan 
the new puerto rico government administration  which commenced on january  and controls the executive and legislative branches of government  has developed and commenced implementing a multi year fiscal stabilization and economic reconstruction plan designed to achieve fiscal balance and restore economic growth 
the fiscal stabilization plan seeks to achieve budgetary balance on or before fiscal year  while addressing expected fiscal deficits in the intervening years through the implementation of a number of initiatives  including the following i a billion operating expense reduction plan during fiscal year  through government reorganization and reduction of operating expenses  including payroll as the main component of government expenditures  ii a combination of temporary and permanent tax increases  coupled with additional tax enforcement measures  and iii a bond issuance program through puerto rico sales tax financing corporation cofina by its spanish language acronym 
before the temporary measures expire in  the administration intends to design and adopt a comprehensive reform of the tax system and a long term economic development plan to complement the economic reconstruction and supplemental stimulus initiatives described below 
the proceeds expected to be obtained from cofina bond issuance program will be used to repay existing government debt including debt with gdb  finance operating expenses of the commonwealth for fiscal years through and for fiscal year  to the extent included in the government s annual budget for such fiscal year  including costs related to the implementation of a workforce reduction plan  the funding of an economic stimulus plan  as described below  and for other purposes to address the fiscal imbalance while the fiscal stabilization plan is being implemented 
the fiscal stabilization plan seeks to safeguard the investment grade ratings of the commonwealth s general obligation debt and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth 
legislation was enacted during authorizing the implementation of all the measures in the fiscal stabilization plan 
economic reconstruction plan 
the current puerto rico government administration has also developed and commenced implementing a short term economic reconstruction plan 
the cornerstone of this plan is the implementation of us federal and local economic stimuli 
puerto rico will benefit from the arra enacted by the us government to provide a stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the global economic downturn 
puerto rico expects to receive approximately billion from arra during the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year  which includes tax relief  expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions  and domestic spending in education  health care  and infrastructure  among other measures 
the administration will seek to complement the us federal stimulus with additional short and medium term supplemental stimulus measures seeking to address specific local challenges and providing investment in strategic areas 
these measures include a local million economic stimulus plan to supplement the federal plan 
the local stimulus is composed of three main elements i capital improvements  ii stimulus for small and medium sized businesses  and iii consumer relief in the form of direct payments to retirees  mortgage debt restructuring for consumers that face risk of default  and consumer stimulus for the purchase of housing 
in addition  to further stimulate economic development and cope with the fiscal crisis  the administration established a legal framework via legislation approved in june to authorize and promote the use of public private partnerships to finance and develop infrastructure projects and operate and manage certain public assets 
the new administration is also developing a comprehensive long term economic development plan aimed at improving puerto rico s overall competitiveness and business environment and increasing private sector participation in the puerto rico economy 
as part of this plan  the administration will emphasize i the simplification and shortening of the permitting and licensing process  ii the strengthening of the labor market by 
table of contents encouraging greater labor force participation and bringing out of date labor laws and regulations in line with us and international standards and iii the adoption of a new energy policy that seeks to lower energy costs and reduce energy price volatility by reducing puerto rico s dependence on fossil fuels  particularly oil  through the promotion of diverse  renewable energy technologies 
one of these goals was accomplished on december   when the puerto rico governor signed act no 
 which overhauls the existing permitting and licensing process in puerto rico in order to provide for a leaner and more efficient process the fosters economic development 
the company cannot predict at this time the impact that the current fiscal situation of the commonwealth of puerto rico and the various legislative and other measures adopted by the puerto rico government in response to such fiscal situation will have on the puerto rico economy and on the company s financial condition and results of operations

after considering the comments on both basel a and the advanced approaches  the 
table of contents agencies proposed a new rule that would provide all non core banking institutions with an option to adopt the standardized approach under basel ii 
this alternative provides a more risk sensitive capital framework to institutions not adopting the advanced approaches without unduly increasing regulatory burden 
a definitive final rule has not been issued 
the proposed rule  if adopted  will replace the basel a approach 
until such time as the new rules for non core banking institutions are adopted  doral financial is unable to predict whether it will adopt a standardized approach under basel ii or the effect that the new rules for non core banking institutions might have on doral bank pr s financial condition or results of its operations 
opting into the basel ii standardized approach would require doral bank to implement advanced measurement techniques employing internal estimates of certain key risk drivers to derive capital requirements 
opting into the basel ii standardized approach may also require meeting more onerous computational requirements 
prior to implementation of the new capital regime  a bank holding company will be required to demonstrate to its primary federal regulator that its measurement approaches meet relevant supervisory standards 
prompt corrective action under fdicia under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  and the regulations promulgated thereunder federal banking regulators must take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia and the regulations thereunder  establish five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least  and is not subject to any written agreement or regulatory directive to meet a specific capital level 
a depository institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it is not well capitalized but maintains a leverage ratio of at least or at least if given the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  a risk based tier l capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least 
a depository institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized institutions unless it is deemed to be significantly or critically undercapitalized 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than  a risk based tier capital ratio of less than or a risk based total capital ratio of less than 
an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to or less of total assets 
a depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives a less than satisfactory examination rating in any one of four categories 
at december   doral financial s banking subsidiaries were well capitalized 
doral bank pr s and doral bank ny s capital categories  as determined by applying the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of doral bank pr or doral bank ny  and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the institutions financial condition and results of operations 
fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee the capital plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of i of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or ii the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 

table of contents the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and their implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions such as doral bank pr and doral bank ny  but they are not directly applicable to bank holding companies  such as doral financial  which control such institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to such provisions and regulations 
interstate banking legislation effective june   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act amended the fdia and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines  with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency  unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to may   expressly prohibiting interstate mergers 
under the riegle neal act amendments  once a state or national bank has established branches in a state  that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
if a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period  no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out  whether through an acquisition or de novo 
for purposes of the riegle neal act amendments to the fdia  doral bank pr is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks 
however  for purposes of the international banking act the iba  doral bank pr is considered to be a foreign bank and may branch interstate by acquisition  merger or de novo to the same extent as a domestic bank in doral bank pr s home state 
because doral bank pr does not currently operate in the mainland united states  it has not designated a home state for purposes of the iba 
it is not yet possible to determine how these statutes will be harmonized  with respect either to which federal agency will approve interstate transactions or with respect to which home state determination rules will apply 
as a federal savings bank  doral bank ny is allowed to branch on an interstate basis without geographic limitations  subject to the branching regulations promulgated by the ots 
dividend restrictions the payment of dividends to doral financial by its banking subsidiaries may be affected by regulatory requirements and policies  such as the maintenance of adequate capital

table of contents others  that relatives  business partners  management officials  affiliates and others are presumed to be acting in concert with each other and their businesses 
section of the banking law requires the prior approval of the office of the commissioner with respect to a transfer of voting stock of a bank that results in a change of control of the bank 
under section  a change of control is presumed to occur if a person or group of persons acting in concert  directly or indirectly  acquires more than of the outstanding voting capital stock of the bank 
the office of the commissioner has interpreted the restrictions of section as applying to acquisitions of voting securities of entities controlling a bank  such as a bank holding company 
under the banking law  the determination of the office of the commissioner whether to approve a change of control filing is final and non appealable 
the provisions of the mortgage banking law also require regulatory approval for the acquisition of more than of doral financial s outstanding voting securities 
please refer to regulation and supervision mortgage origination and servicing above 
the above regulatory restrictions relating to investment in doral financial may have the effect of discouraging takeover attempts against doral financial and may limit the ability of persons  other than doral financial directors duly authorized by doral financial s board of directors  to solicit or exercise proxies  or otherwise exercise voting rights  in connection with matters submitted to a vote of doral financial s stockholders 
insurance operations doral insurance agency is registered as a corporate agent and general agency with the office of the commissioner of insurance of puerto rico the commissioner of insurance 
the operations of doral insurance agency are subject to the applicable provisions of the puerto rico insurance code and to regulation by the commissioner of insurance relating to  among other things  licensing of employees  sales practices  charging of commissions and obligations to customers 
doral insurance agency is subject to supervision and examination by the commissioner of insurance 
changes to legislation or regulation changes to federal and local laws and regulations including changes in interpretation and enforcement can affect the operating environment of the company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways 
from time to time  various legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced 
these proposals  if adopted  may change laws and regulations and the company s operating environment 
if adopted  some of these laws and regulations could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings institutions  credit unions and other financial institutions 
the company cannot accurately predict whether those changes in laws and regulations will occur  and  if those changes occur  the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations 
it is likely  however  that the current high level of enforcement and compliance related activities of federal and puerto rico authorities will continue and potentially increase 
recent puerto rico legislation and regulatory developments on august   the governor of puerto rico signed into a law an amendment to the puerto rico notarial law pursuant to which the rules regarding the payment of the notarial tariff in public deeds includes  among other things  deeds to purchase real estate and deeds to constitute mortgages over real estate executed before a notary public in puerto rico were changed 
subject to certain limited exceptions  the amendment makes mandatory the charging of the notarial tariff and prohibits any agreement that provides that any portion of the notarial tariff may be reduced  waived or credited to other legal services provided 
the required notarial tariff equals of the amount involved in the transaction up to a transaction amount of  and thereafter of of the amount involved in the transaction in excess of  up to a transaction amount of million 
this amendment has led to an increase of the closing costs and fees payable by persons involved in real estate purchase and mortgage loan transactions in puerto rico  which in turn may have contributed to a reduction in the number of real estate purchase and mortgage loan transactions in puerto rico 
in addition  this amendment may further make mortgage loan refinancings in puerto rico less sensitive to interest rate changes than mortgage loan refinancings in the united states 

table of contents on july   the governor of puerto rico signed into law an additional amendment to the notarial law reducing the amounts of the notarial tariff that had been established in august in an attempt to reduce the closing costs and fees payable by persons involved in real estate purchase and mortgage transactions in puerto rico 
the new minimum notarial tariff is of of the amount involved in the transaction up to a transaction amount of 
for transactions that involve an amount in excess of  the minimum notarial tariff is of of the transaction amount for the initial  or a minimum notarial tariff of  plus an additional amount to be agreed upon by the notary public and the parties to the transaction 
law number of december  as later amended  law was enacted in puerto rico to provide tax incentives for certain housing unit purchases in order to stimulate the puerto rico construction industry and the puerto rico economy 
law provided tax credits to financial institutions in connection with their financing of the following housing unit purchase transactions i in connection with the purchase from a developer by an individual of a housing unit of new construction  a tax credit equal to of the sales price of the housing unit up to a maximum credit of ii in connection with the purchase from a developer by an individual of a housing unit of new construction that will be his or her principal residence must be owned and used as such for a period of at least years  a tax credit equal to of the sales price of the housing unit up to a maximum credit of  and iii in connection with the purchase from an existing owner by an individual of an existing housing unit  a tax credit equal to of the sales price of the housing unit up to a maximum credit of  in order to qualify for the credit  a financial institution had to i reduce the amount of the credit to be received from the principal amount owed by the borrower under the mortgage loan provided in connection with the qualifying housing purchase  and ii submit a credit request form to the puerto rico treasury department together with certain additional documents and information 
law provides that once the financial institution had filed all of the required information  the puerto rico treasury department secretary had a period of days to approve or deny the credit request  and that the credit would be approved if the puerto rico treasury department secretary failed to act within the day period 
the tax credits granted to financial institutions would be available for use to offset their income taxes in three installments i the first installment being from january  to june   ii the second installment being from july  to december   and iii the third installment being from january  to june  the tax credits were freely transferable by the financial institutions  and the financial institutions could request a refund from the puerto rico treasury department if the tax credits could not be used or transferred within the time periods provided 
law established the following limitations in connection with the tax credit program i in the case of housing units of new construction  the developers had to comply with certain requirements relating to qualifying the housing units available for sale under the tax credit program with the puerto rico department of consumer affairs  ii in the case of the existing housing units  the owners interested in participating in the program had to qualify their units with the puerto rico department of consumer affairs  and the total number of existing housing units that could be qualified was limited to iii the purchase transaction of the new or existing housing units had to be completed on or before december   and iv the total amount of the tax credits available under law could not exceed million 
on december   the puerto rico treasury department secretary notified puerto rico financial institutions that the total amount of tax credits of million available under law had been exhausted  and therefore no additional credits could be issued to financial institutions 
based on the fact that the puerto rico treasury 
table of contents department had not given sufficient advance notice of the fact that the amount of the tax credits was close to being exhausted  various puerto rico financial institutions  including doral financial  had closed mortgage loans in which the amount of the mortgage loan was reduced based on the expectation that the corresponding tax credit would be received once the required documentation was filed 
in the case of doral financial  it had closed a total of qualified mortgage loans that would have been eligible for additional tax credits in the amount of million if the tax credits under law had not been exhausted

risk factors 
readers should carefully consider  in connection with other information disclosed in this annual report on form k  the risk factors set forth below 
the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  other factors  besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this report or other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec  also could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document are a complete set of all potential risks we may face 
these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those discussed in forward looking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form k 
please also refer to the section titled forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
risks related to the general business environment and our industry the actions of the united states government and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the united states financial markets may not achieve the intended effect 
in october  the united states government enacted the eesa in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions 
the eesa provided the us treasury secretary with the authority to use up to billion to  among other things  inject capital into financial institutions and establish the tarp  to purchase mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purposes of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
in february  the us treasury department put forward a general description of a new financial stability plan  including a revised approach to tarp 
the new financial stability plan may commit in excess of trillion  from a combination of the remaining tarp funds  federal reserve funds and private sector investments 
the new financial stability plan included i new capital injections into banks that undergo a comprehensive stress test and need an additional capital buffer to help absorb losses  ii a new public private investment fund started by the us treasury department  along with the federal reserve and the fdic  to assist in disposition of illiquid assets in the balance sheets of financial institutions the plan initially seeks to leverage private capital with public funds on an initial scale of billion  but potentially up to trillion  iii an expansion of the previously announced talf from billion to trillion and the inclusion in such program of commercial mortgage backed securities  and iv the commitment of billion from the tarp for foreclosure mitigation programs this is part of a much broader foreclosure mitigation program included in the homeowner affordability and stability plan discussed below 
on february   president obama announced the administration s homeowner affordability and stability plan that is designed to  among other things  assist homeowners unable to refinance their loans or struggling to meet their mortgage obligations 
the proposed homeowner affordability and stability plan seeks to help these homeowners by providing i access for borrowers to low cost financing on conforming loans owned or guaranteed by fnma or fhlmc  ii a billion homeowner stability initiative to prevent foreclosures  and iii additional commitments allowing the us treasury department to purchase up to an additional billion of preferred stock of fnma and fhlmc and allowing fnma and fhlmc to increase the size of their retained mortgage portfolios by billion 
the billion homeowner stability proposal includes financial incentives to borrowers and servicers in connection with loan modifications  the development of national standards for loan modifications  and support for the modification of bankruptcy laws to allow bankruptcy judges to modify residential mortgage loans 

table of contents the actual impact  however  that the eesa  the financial stability plan and the homeowner affordability and stability plan will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability being experienced  is uncertain 
the failure of the eesa  the financial stability plan and the homeowner affordability and stability plan to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  or access to credit 
in addition  the united states government and the federal reserve  us treasury department  fdic and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken other actions to address the financial crisis 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or access to credit 
difficult market conditions have already affected our industry and us and may continue to adversely affect us 
given that almost all of our business is in puerto rico and the united states and given the degree of interrelation between puerto rico s economy and that of the united states  we are particularly exposed to downturns in the us economy 
dramatic declines in the us housing market over the past two years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities  in turn  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital from private and government entities  to merge with larger and stronger financial institutions and  in some cases  fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already adversely affected our industry and has and may continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has experienced increased levels of non performing assets and otti charges on its non agency mbss as a result of current market conditions 
we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we expect to face increased regulation of our industry  including as a result of the eesa and the financial stability plan 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors 
the processes we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  including forecast of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the processes 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government sponsored entities on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including deteriorating investor expectations 
competition in our industry could intensify as a result of increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 

table of contents we may be required to pay in the future significantly higher fdic assessments on our deposits if market conditions do not improve or if market conditions deteriorate 
higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that either i reduces the amount that our borrowers are required to pay us  or ii limits our ability to foreclose on properties or collateral or makes foreclosures less economically viable 
in particular  there is legislation pending in the us congress that would allow a chapter bankruptcy plan to cram down the value of certain mortgages on a consumer s principal residence to its market value and or reset debtor interest rate and monthly payments to an amount that permits them to remain in their homes 
the company s business is concentrated in puerto rico and continued weakness of puerto rico economy may continue to adversely affect us 
the company s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
adverse political or economic developments  increases in unemployment  decreases in housing values or natural disasters  such as hurricanes  could result in a downturn in loan originations  an increase in the level of non performing assets  an increase in the rate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans and a reduction in the value of the company s loans and loan servicing portfolio 
puerto rico s economy is currently in a recession that commenced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that ended june   a fiscal year in which puerto rico s real gross national product grew by only 
for fiscal years and  puerto rico s real gross national product contracted by and  respectively 
according to the latest information published by the planning board in january  the contraction continued through fiscal year with a reduction in puerto rico s real gross national product of 
the puerto rico labor department reported an unemployment rate of for september  compared to an unemployment rate of for september while the recessionary trend was expected to continue in current fiscal year  the planning board announced in august that the expected positive impact of the united states and local economic stimulus measures generally discussed in part i above under general business  economic and political conditions  puerto rico economy and fiscal condition should outweigh the expected negative impact of the fiscal stabilization plan also discussed in part i above under general business  economic and political conditions  puerto rico economy and fiscal condition  and revised its projections for fiscal year to reflect an increase of in puerto rico s real gross national product 
the revised forecast also considered the effect on the puerto rico economy of general global economic conditions  the us economy  changes and volatility of oil prices  interest rates and the behavior of local exports  including expenditures by visitors 
the planning board  however  is currently working on a revised fiscal year gross national product forecast that would take into account the recently announced preliminary results for fiscal year  the economic impact of a delay in the disbursement of funds from the arra  and other economic factors that may require a downward revision of their projection 
the revised projection may show a continued reduction in gross national product during fiscal year the planning board expects to complete and announce the revised projection during the first quarter of the government of puerto rico estimated that its structural deficit for fiscal year was billion or over of its general fund budget 
it is in the process of implementing various plans for reducing the deficit  as its access to the municipal bond market and its credit ratings depend  in part  on achieving a balanced budget 
measures that the government has implemented have included reducing expenses  including public sector employment through layoffs of employees 
since the government is the largest source of employment in puerto rico  these measures will have the effect of increasing unemployment and could have the effect of intensifying the current recessionary cycle 
in addition  a payment or other material default by the government of puerto rico or any of its agencies  public corporations or instrumentalities with respect to their municipal bond or note obligations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the current state of the puerto rico economy  higher unemployment levels and continued uncertainty in the public and private sectors has had an adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios and reduced the level of our loan originations in puerto rico 
the continuation of the economic slowdown would cause those adverse effects to continue  as delinquency rates may continue to increase in the short term  until sustainable growth of the puerto rico economy resumes 
also  potential reduction in consumer spending as a result of continued recessionary conditions may also impact growth in other interest and non interest revenue sources of the company 

table of contents the imposition of additional property tax payments in puerto rico may further deteriorate our loan portfolios 
on march   the governor of puerto rico signed into law the special act declaring a state of emergency and establishing an integral plan of fiscal stabilization to save puerto rico s credit act no 

act no 
 as amended  imposes a series of temporary and permanent revenue raising measures  including the imposition of a special tax to properties used for residential excluding certain exempt properties or values and commercial purposes 
this temporary measure will be effective for tax years that commenced after june  and before july  the imposition of this special property tax could adversely affect the disposable income of borrowers from our commercial  construction  consumer and mortgage loan portfolios and may cause an increase in our delinquency and foreclosure rates 
market volatility and disruption could affect us 
the capital and credit markets  although recovering  have been experiencing volatility and disruption for almost two years 
during the second half of and throughout  the volatility and disruption reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  we could experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on our ability to access credit and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
we have exposure to different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  investment companies and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us 
any such losses could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in interest rates could negatively affect the company s income and cash flows 
our income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets such as loans and investment securities  and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular  the federal reserve board 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  will influence the origination of loans  the prepayment speed of loans  the value of loans  investment securities and mortgage servicing assets  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits  and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding 
increases in fdic insurance assessments may have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
during and  higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased resolution costs of the fdic and depleted the deposit insurance fund 
in addition  the us congress and the fdic have instituted two temporary programs to further insure customer deposits at fdic member banks i deposit accounts are now insured up to  per customer up from  until december   and ii certain non interest bearing transactional accounts are fully insured unlimited coverage until june  these programs have placed additional stress on the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic increased the amount of the insurance assessments that we paid on our insured deposits during because market developments have led to a substantial increase in bank failures and an increase in fdic loss reserves  which in turn has led to a depletion of the insurance fund of the fdic and a reduction of the ratio of 
table of contents reserves to insured deposits 
in may  the fdic adopted a final rule  effective june   that imposed a special assessment of five cents for every on each insured depository institution s assets minus its tier capital as of june   subject to a cap equal to cents per of assessable deposits for the second quarter of on september   in order to strengthen the cash position of the fdic s deposit insurance fund  the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require our banking subsidiaries to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and in addition  the fdic adopted a three basis point increase in assessment rates effective on january  under the proposed rule each institution s deposit assessment base would be calculated using its third quarter deposit assessment base  adjusted quarterly for an estimated percent annual growth rate in the deposit assessment base through the end of the prepaid assessment would be collected on december  and would be mandatory for all institutions subject to the exercise of the fdic s discretion to exempt an institution if the fdic determines that the prepayment would affect the safety and soundness of the institution 
the fdic adopted the final rule implementing the prepayment of assessments on november  our total prepaid assessments were million  which according to the final rule were recorded as a prepaid expense as of december  the prepaid assessments will be amortized and recognized as an expense over the following three years 
we are generally unable to control the amount of assessments that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures  or if our risk rating deteriorates for purposes of determining the level of our fdic insurance assessments  we may be required to pay even higher fdic insurance assessments than the recently increased levels 
any future increases in fdic insurance assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations 
unforeseen disruptions in the brokered deposits market could compromise the company s liquidity position 
a relatively large portion of our funding is retail brokered deposits issued by doral bank pr 
our total brokered deposits as of december  were billion 
an unforeseen disruption in the brokered deposits market  stemming from factors such as legal  regulatory or financial risks  could adversely affect our ability to fund a portion of our operations and or meet obligations 
adverse credit market conditions may affect the company s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
the credit markets  although recovering  have recently been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
during the last eighteen months  the volatility and disruptions reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity of certain issuers  particularly for non investment grade issuers like us 
we need liquidity to  among other things  pay our operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends on our preferred stock if dividends are declared and paid  maintain our lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities 
without sufficient liquidity  we may be forced to curtail our operations 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit and our credit capacity 
our cash flows and financial condition could be materially affected by continued disruptions in the financial markets 
the company operates within a highly regulated industry and its business and results are significantly affected by the regulations to which it is subject  changes in statutes and regulations could adversely affect the company 
we operate within a highly regulated environment 
the regulations to which the company is subject will continue to have a significant impact on the company s operations and the degree to which it can grow and be profitable 
certain regulators which supervise the company have significant power in reviewing the company s operations and approving its business practices 
these powers include the ability to place limitations or conditions on activities in which the company engages or intends to engage 
particularly in recent years  the company s businesses have experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny  often requiring additional company resources 

table of contents current economic conditions  particularly in the financial markets  have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry 
the us government has intervened on an unprecedented scale  responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis  by enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions  establishing a commercial paper funding facility  temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances  and increasing insurance on bank deposits 
these programs have subjected participating financial institutions to additional restrictions  oversight and costs 
in addition  new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the us congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices  including aspects such as compensation  interest rates  financial product offerings and disclosures  and the impact of bankruptcy proceedings on consumer residential real estate mortgages  among others 
federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied 
on june   the us treasury department released a white paper entitled financial regulatory reform a new foundation rebuilding financial regulation and supervision  which outlined the obama administration s plan to make extensive and wide ranging reforms to the us financial regulatory system 
the plan contains proposals to  among other things  i create a new financial regulatory agency called the consumer financial protection agency  ii eliminate the federal thrift charter and create a new national bank supervisor  iii dispose of the interstate branching framework of the riegle neal act by giving national and state chartered banks the unrestricted ability to branch across state lines  iv establish strengthened capital and prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies  v increase supervision and regulation of large financial firms  and vi create an office of national insurance within the us treasury department 
on december   the us house of representatives passed the wall street reform and consumer protection act  which included some of the us treasury department s proposed reforms 
it is expected that the us senate will soon begin its consideration of legislative proposals for financial reform 
we cannot predict the substance or impact of any change in regulation  whether by regulators or as a result of legislation enacted by the united states congress or by the puerto rico legislature  or in the way such statutory or regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced 
compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs  impede the efficiency of our internal business practices  require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect the company s financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to promulgate new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments  structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures 
the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed by the company in its filings with the sec 
an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are still subject to change 
it is possible that future accounting standards that the company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our business for the year ended december   the company s credit quality  including the potential for credit losses on its investment portfolio  continued to be affected by the sustained deterioration of the economic conditions affecting our markets  including higher unemployment levels  much lower absorption rates and further declines in property values 
the company s credit quality continued to be under pressure during as a result of continued recessionary conditions in puerto rico and the united states that have led to  among other things  higher unemployment levels  much lower absorption rates for new residential construction projects and further declines in property values 

table of contents our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying our investments 
if the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases  if the risk profile of a market  industry or group of customers changes materially  our business  financial condition  allowance levels  asset impairments  liquidity  capital and results of operations could be adversely affected 
there is no certainty that our allowance for loan and lease losses will be sufficient to cover future credit losses in the portfolio because of continued adverse changes in the economy  market conditions or events negatively affecting specific customers  industries or markets both in puerto rico and the united states 
we periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends  collateral values and credit quality indicators  including past charge off experience and levels of past due loans and non performing assets 
some of our mortgage backed securities and other investments continue to experience declines in their market values as a result of adverse market conditions 
for such securities  management believes they are not more likely than not to be sold before anticipated recovery of remaining amortized cost basis 
as of december   the company recognized otti on seven of its non agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmo 
management has determined that unrealized losses in its investment portfolio are temporary 
valuation and otti determinations will continue to be affected by external market factors including default rates  severity rates and macro economic factors in the united states and puerto rico 
the company s future results may be materially affected by worsening defaults and severity rates related to the underlying collateral 
an additional loss may have to be accrued by the company with respect to a pending lehman brothers inc claim 
doral financial and doral bank pr combined doral had counterparty exposure to lbi in connection with repurchase financing agreements and forward to be announced tba agreements 
lbi was placed in a securities investor protection corporation sipc liquidation proceeding after the filing for bankruptcy of its parent  lehman brothers holdings inc the commencement of the sipc liquidation proceeding was an event of default under the repurchase agreements and the forward agreements resulting in their termination as of september  the termination of the agreements led to a reduction in the company s total assets and total liabilities of approximately million and caused doral to recognize a previously unrealized loss on the value of the securities subject to the agreements  resulting in a million charge during the third quarter of in a letter dated october   doral notified lbi and the sipc trustee that it was owed approximately million  representing the excess of the value of the securities held by lbi above the amounts owed by doral under the agreements  plus ancillary expenses and accrued interest 
doral has fully reserved ancillary expenses and interest 
in december  the sipc trustee announced that the deadline for final submission of claims for customers was january and set a deadline of june for other creditor claims 
the sipc trustee also announced that it expected to have enough assets to cover customer claims but stated that it could not determine at that point what would be available to pay general creditors 
based on the information available in the fourth quarter of  doral determined that the process would likely take more than a year and that mounting legal and operating costs would likely impair the ability of lbi to pay of the claims filed against it  especially for general creditors 
the fourth quarter of also saw the continued decline in asset values  and management concluded that it was likely that lbi assets would also decline in value 
management evaluated this receivable in accordance with the guidance provided by asc sfas no 
and related pronouncements 
as a result  doral accrued as of december  a loss of million against the million owed by lbi 
the net receivable of million is recorded in accounts receivable on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
determining the reserve amount requires management to use considerable judgment and is based on the facts currently available 
on january   doral timely filed customer claims against lbi in the sipc liquidation proceeding 
on august   the sipc trustee issued notices of determination to doral i denying doral s claims for treatment as a customer with respect to the cash and or securities held by lbi under the repurchase financing agreements and forward tba agreements between doral and lbi  and ii converting doral s claims to general creditor claims 
on september   doral filed objections in bankruptcy court to the sipc trustee s determinations  which 
table of contents objections remain pending 
on october   the sipc trustee filed a motion in bankruptcy court seeking leave to allocate property within the lbi estate entirely to customer claims 
the motion asserted that the colorable customer claims will approach and  depending on how certain disputed issues are resolved  could exceed the assets available to the sipc trustee for distribution 
on october   doral objected to this motion as premature since as the sipc trustee noted the process of marshalling assets in the estate is ongoing and giving the sipc trustee unwarranted discretion 
doral also reaffirmed its entitlement to customer treatment 
an evidentiary hearing on the motion has been scheduled for february  the sipc trustee has modified the relief sought in the proposed order in respect of the motion based on which doral has withdrawn its objection to the motion 
once a final determination regarding doral s objections to the denial of its claims for treatment as a customer is issued and once additional information on the sipc proceeding is obtained such as  for example  the amount of customer and general creditor claims and the amount of funds that may be available to cover each class of claims  doral may need to accrue an additional loss with respect to the net lbi receivable of million 
such accrual of an additional loss may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the period in which such additional loss is accrued 
deteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted the company and may continue to adversely impact the company 
the company has experienced a downturn in credit quality since  and the company expects credit conditions and the performance of its loan portfolio may continue to deteriorate in the near future 
the company is subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to loans originated or acquired 
the company establishes provisions for loan losses  which lead to reductions in the income from operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and guidelines 
this process  which is critical to the company s financial results and condition  requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments about the future  including forecasts of economic and market conditions that might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay the loans 
the company may have to increase the provisions for loan losses in the future as a result of future increases in non performing loans or for other reasons beyond its control 
accordingly  a decrease in the quality of the company s credit portfolio could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company and its banking subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  and if we fail to meet those guidelines our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements  the company and its banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  subject to quantitative judgments by regulators regarding components  risk weightings and other factors 
our bank regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition  risk profile and growth plans 
if the company and its banking subsidiaries fail to meet minimum capital and other regulatory requirements  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
a failure to meet regulatory capital adequacy guidelines at our bank subsidiaries would  among other things  affect their ability to accept or roll over brokered deposits 
the hedging transactions that the company enters into may not be effective in managing the exposure to interest rate risk 
the company uses derivatives  to a limited extent  to manage part of its exposure to market risk caused by changes in interest rates 
the derivative instruments that the company may use also have their own risks  which include i basis risk  which is the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and or hedge cost  ii credit or default risk  which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder  and iii legal risk  which is the risk that the company is unable to enforce the terms of such instruments 
all or any of these risks could expose the company to losses 

table of contents our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk  which could negatively affect us 
management of risk requires  among other things  policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events 
we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future 
nonetheless  our policies and procedures may not be comprehensive given current market conditions 
some of our methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models 
as a result  these methods may not fully predict future exposures  which could be significantly greater than our historical measures indicate 
other risk management methods depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets  clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us 
this information may not always be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 
we may engage in fdic assisted transactions  which could present additional risks to our business 
we may have opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions 
although these transactions typically provide for fdic assistance to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks  such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution  we would still be subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction  including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect 
in addition  because these transactions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and access to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated transaction  we may face additional risk in fdic assisted transactions  including additional strain on management resources  management of problem loans  problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with fdic assisted transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates that affect our financial statements 
four of the company s most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the amount of otti of its non agency securities  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the amount of its deferred tax asset 
due to the inherent nature of these estimates the company may significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance  and may recognize a significant provision for impairment of its mortgage servicing rights 
if the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is not adequate  the company s business  financial condition  including its liquidity and capital  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  in the future  the company may increase its allowance for loan and lease losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its capital and results of operations 
in  the company recognized million of otti 
the otti estimate is based upon analysis of the probability of default and loss given default of the residential mortgage loans which underlie the security 
if default experiences increase or are later estimated to increase beyond the previously estimated levels  the company may increase the amount of otti  which could have a material adverse effect on its capital and results of operation 
as of december   the company had a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
the deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance of million 
the realization of the company s deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to realize the value of this asset 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  it is reasonably possible that the company will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted if it determines that increases to its deferred tax asset valuation allowance are required in a future reporting period 

table of contents defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition 
in connection with the sale and securitization of mortgage loans  the company is required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding the company and the loans being sold or securitized 
the company s obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan  and they relate to  among other things compliance with laws and regulations  underwriting standards  the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file  and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan 
a loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell  may impact the company s ability to obtain third party financing for the loan  and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount 
if such a loan is sold before the company detects a noncompliance  the company may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly  or the company may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such loss  either of which could reduce the company s cash available for operations and liquidity 
the company s current management team believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market s requirements  but mistakes may be made  or certain employees may deliberately violate the company s lending policies 
the company seeks to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws  if possible  and selling or re selling such loans 
the company does not have a reserve on its financial statements for possible losses related to repurchases resulting from representation and warranty violations because it does not expect any such losses to be significant 
losses associated with defective loans may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 
we are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans held pending sale and mortgage loans that have been sold subject to recourse arrangements 
the company is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
in the past  the company retained  through recourse arrangements  part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans that did not qualify for gnma  fnma or fhlmc sale or exchange programs and consequently may suffer losses on these loans 
the company suffers losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property 
the company estimates the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or any liability incurred at the time of sale and includes such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in lower gain on sale recognition 
the company evaluates the fair value of its recourse obligation based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
we are subject to risks in servicing loans for others 
the company s profitability may also be adversely affected by mortgage loan delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans that it services for third parties 
under many of its servicing contracts  the company must advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of an outstanding mortgage loan  even when mortgage loan payments are delinquent 
in addition  in order to protect their liens on mortgaged properties  owners of mortgage loans usually require that the company  as servicer  pay mortgage and hazard insurance and tax payments on schedule even if sufficient escrow funds are not available 
the company generally recovers its advances from the mortgage owner or from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage loan is foreclosed 
however  in the interim  the company must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
the company must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans 
in addition  if a default is not cured  the mortgage loan will be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and the company will not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan 

table of contents we may fail to retain and attract key employees and management personnel 
our success has been and will continue to be influenced by our ability to retain and attract key employees and management personnel  including senior and middle management 
our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel may be adversely affected as a result of the workload and stress associated with the resolution of legacy issues and business transformation efforts  and related risks and uncertainties 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the profitability of our operations 
the company faces significant competition from other financial institutions  many of which have significantly greater assets  capital and other resources 
as a result  many of the company s competitors have advantages in conducting certain businesses and providing certain services 
this competitive environment could force the company to increase the rates it offers on deposits or lower the rates it charges on loans and  consequently  could adversely affect the profitability of its operations 
damage to our reputation could damage our businesses 
maintaining a positive reputation for the company is critical to the company attracting and maintaining customers  investors and employees 
damage to its reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the company s business and prospects 
harm to the company s reputation can arise from numerous sources  including  among others  employee misconduct  litigation or regulatory outcomes  failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality  compliance failures  unethical behavior  and the activities of customers and counterparties 
negative publicity regarding the company  whether or not true  may also result in harm to the company s prospects 
doral financial and its banking subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of various banking regulators and have entered into consent orders with these regulators  and these regulators could take action against the company or its banking subsidiaries

federal banking regulators  in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties  have significant discretion and power to initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators include  among others  the ability to assess civil monetary penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders  to require written agreements and to initiate injunctive actions 
doral financial and doral bank pr have entered into consent orders with the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the commissioner  which  among other things  prohibited the company s banking subsidiaries from paying dividends to the parent company  and prohibited doral financial from paying dividends to its common and preferred shareholders  without regulatory approval and required doral bank pr to take various actions to ensure compliance with the provisions of the bank secrecy act 
while the fdic and the office of the commissioner have lifted their consent orders  these banking regulators could take further action with respect to doral financial or our banking subsidiaries and  if any such further action were taken  such action could have a material adverse effect on doral financial 
the company s consent order with the federal reserve is still in effect  and the company s banking regulators could take additional actions to protect the company s banking subsidiaries or to ensure that the holding company remains as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries  and such action could have adverse effects on the company or its stockholders 
doral financial has been the subject of an investigation by the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york  which could require it to pay substantial fines or penalties

on march   a former treasurer of doral financial was indicted for alleged criminal violations involving securities and wire fraud 
on august   mario s 
levis  the former treasurer of doral  filed a complaint against the company in the supreme court of the state of new york 
the complaint alleges that the company breached a contract with the plaintiff and the company s by laws by failing to advance payment of certain legal fees and expenses that mr 
levis has incurred in connection with a criminal indictment filed against him in the us district court for the southern district of new york

on december   mr 
levis motion for a preliminary injunction was denied as moot  and all further proceedings were stayed  but the procedures for future disputes between the parties as outlined in the settlement agreement were not affected by the stay

depending on our capital needs  we may make such a determination in the near future or in subsequent periods 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of any such future offering  as well as other sales of a large block of shares of our common stock or similar securities in the market thereafter  or the perception that such sales could occur 
in addition  such additional equity issuances would reduce any earnings available to the holders of our common stock and the return thereon unless our earnings increase correspondingly 
we cannot predict the timing or size of future equity issuances  if any  or the effect that they may have on the market price of the common stock 
the issuance of substantial amounts of equity  or the perception that such issuances may occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

in addition  we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock unless and until we resume payments of dividends on our preferred stock  which were suspended by the board of directors in march our ability to pay dividends in the future is limited by various regulatory requirements and policies of bank regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the company and such other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
under an existing consent order with the federal reserve  we are restricted from paying dividends on our capital stock without the prior written approval of the federal reserve 
we are required to request permission for the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock not less than days prior to a proposed dividend declaration date 
we may not receive approval for the payment of such dividends in the future or  even with such approval  our board of directors may not resume payment of dividends 
our share price may fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations because of factors specifically related to our businesses and general market conditions 
factors that could cause such fluctuations  many of which could be beyond our control  include the following changes or perceived changes in the condition  operations  results or prospects of our businesses and market assessments of these changes or perceived changes  announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  changes in governmental regulations or proposals  or new government regulations or proposals  affecting us  including those relating to the current financial crisis and global economic downturn and those that may be specifically directed to us  the continued decline  failure to stabilize or lack of improvement in general market and economic conditions in our principal markets  the departure of key personnel  changes in the credit  mortgage and real estate markets  operating results that vary from expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  and operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us

lehman brothers transactions doral had counterparty exposure to lbi in connection with repurchase financing agreements and forward tba agreements 
lbi was placed in a sipc liquidation proceeding after the filing for bankruptcy of its parent lehman brothers holdings inc the commencement of the sipc liquidation proceeding was an event of default under the repurchase agreements and the forward agreements resulting in their termination as of september  the termination of the agreements led to a reduction in the company s total assets and total liabilities of approximately million and caused doral to recognize a previously unrealized loss on the value of the securities subject to the agreements  resulting in a million charge during the third quarter of in a letter dated on october   doral notified lbi and the sipc trustee that it was owed approximately million  representing the excess of the value of the securities held by lbi above the amounts owed by doral under the agreements  plus ancillary expenses and accrued interest 
doral has fully reserved ancillary expenses and interest 
in december  the sipc trustee announced that the deadline for final submission of claims for customers was january and set a deadline of june for other creditor claims 
the sipc trustee also announced that it expected to have enough assets to cover customer claims but stated that it could not determine at that point what would be available to pay general creditors 

table of contents based on the information available in the fourth quarter of  doral determined that the process would likely take more than a year and that mounting legal and operating costs would likely impair the ability of lbi to pay of the claims filed against it  especially for general creditors 
the fourth quarter of also saw the continued decline in asset values and management concluded that it was likely that lbi assets would also decline in value 
management evaluated this receivable in accordance with the guidance provided by asc sfas no 
and related pronouncements 
as a result  doral accrued as of december  a loss of million against the million owed by lbi 
the net receivable of million is recorded in accounts receivable on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
determining the reserve amount requires management to use considerable judgment and is based on the facts currently available 
on january   doral timely filed customer claims against lbi in the sipc liquidation proceeding 
on august   the sipc trustee issued notices of determination to doral i denying doral s claims for treatment as a customer with respect to the cash and or securities held by lbi under the repurchase financing agreements and forward agreements between doral and lbi  and ii converting doral s claims to general creditor claims 
on september   doral filed objections in bankruptcy court to the sipc trustee s determinations  which objections remain pending 
on october   the sipc trustee filed a motion in bankruptcy court seeking leave to allocate property within the lbi estate entirely to customer claims 
the motion asserted that the colorable customer claims will approach and  depending on how certain disputed issues are resolved  could exceed the assets available to the sipc trustee for distribution 
on october   doral objected to this motion as premature since as the sipc trustee noted the process of marshalling assets in the estate is ongoing and giving the sipc trustee unwarranted discretion 
doral also reaffirmed its entitlement to customer treatment 
an evidentiary hearing on the motion has been scheduled for february  the sipc trustee has modified the relief sought in the proposed order in respect of the motion based on which doral has withdrawn its objection to the motion 
once a final determination regarding doral s objections to the denial of its claims for treatment as a customer is issued and once additional information on the sipc proceeding is obtained such as  for example  the amount of customer and general creditor claims and the amount of funds that may be available to cover each class of claims  doral may need to accrue an additional loss with respect to the net lbi receivable of million 
such accrual of an additional loss may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the period in which such additional loss is accrued

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expenses in doral financial s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of these estimates are critical to the presentation of doral financial s financial condition since they are particularly sensitive to the company s judgment and are highly complex in nature 
doral financial believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of december  however  given the sensitivity of doral financial s consolidated financial statements to these estimates  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in doral financial s results of operations or financial condition 
various elements of doral financial s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
note to doral financial s consolidated financial statements contain a summary of the most significant accounting policies followed by doral financial in the preparation of its financial statements 
the accounting policies that have a significant impact on doral financial s statements and that require the most judgment are set forth below 
fair value measurements the company uses fair value measurements to state certain assets and liabilities at fair value and to support fair value disclosures 
securities held for trading  securities available for sale  derivatives and servicing assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  such as loans held for sale  loans receivable and certain other assets 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of the lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
effective january   the company adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  previously sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

asc sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures requirements for fair value measurements 

table of contents the company adopted asc  financial instruments  previously sfas no 
 the fair value option for financing assets and financing liabilities  sfas no 
 in  but chose not to apply the fair value option to any of its financial assets and financial liabilities 
effective april   the company adopted asc  financial instruments  previously fsp fas no 
and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments fsp fas no 
and apb 
asc requires the company to disclose for interim reporting periods and in its financial statements for annual reporting periods the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not in the statement of financial position  as required by asc previously sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas no 

fair value hierarchy under asc sfas no 
 the company groups its assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels  based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value 
these levels are level valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market  or are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  by correlation or by other means 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
determination of fair value under asc sfas no 
 the company bases fair values on the price that would be received upon sale of an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
it is doral financial s intent to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in asc sfas no 

fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there is limited or no observable market data are based primarily upon the company s estimates  and are generally calculated based on current pricing policy  the economic and competitive environment  the characteristics of the asset or liability and other such factors 
therefore  the fair values represent management s estimates and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability 
additionally  there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique  and changes in the underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  could significantly affect the results of current or future values 
please refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and its impact on earnings 
gain or loss on mortgage loan sales the company generally sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates 
fha and va loans are generally securitized into gnma mortgage backed securities and held as trading securities 
after holding these securities for a period of time  usually less than one month  doral financial sells these securities for cash 
conforming conventional loans are generally sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or institutional investors or 
table of contents exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells for cash through broker dealers 
as part of its mortgage loan sale and securitization activities  doral financial generally retains the right to service the mortgage loans it sells 
doral financial determines the gain on sale of a mortgage backed security or loan pool by allocating the carrying value  also known as basis  of the underlying mortgage loans between the mortgage backed security or mortgage loan pool sold and its retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the gain on sale reported by doral financial is the difference between the proceeds received from the sale and the cost allocated to the loans sold 
the proceeds include cash and other assets received in the transaction primarily msrs less any liabilities incurred ie  representations and warranty provisions 
the reported gain or loss is the difference between the proceeds from the sale of the security or mortgage loan pool and its allocated cost 
the amount of gain on sale is therefore influenced by the values of the msrs and retained interest recorded at the time of sale 
see retained interest valuation below for additional information 
if in a transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash or other consideration other than beneficial interests in transferred assets  doral financial has not surrendered control over the transferred assets according to the provisions of asc  transfers and servicing  previously fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment of fasb no 
 doral financial accounts for the transfer as a secured borrowing loan payable with a pledge of collateral 
retained interest valuation the company routinely originates  securitizes and sells mortgage loans into the secondary market 
the company generally retains the servicing rights and  in the past  also retained ios 
msrs represent the estimated present value of the normal servicing fees net of related servicing costs expected to be received on a loan being serviced over the expected term of the loan 
msrs entitle doral financial to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balance of the loans serviced and the contractual servicing fee 
the annual servicing fees generally range between and basis points  less  in certain cases  any corresponding guarantee fee 
in addition  msrs may entitle doral financial  depending on the contract language  to ancillary income including late charges  float income  and prepayment penalties net of the appropriate expenses incurred for performing the servicing functions 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with such loans is evaluated based on ancillary income  including float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
the company s interests that continue to be held retained interest are subject to prepayment and interest rate risk 
msrs are classified as servicing assets in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
any servicing liability recognized is included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
doral financial engages third party specialists to assist with its valuation of the company s servicing portfolio governmental  conforming and non conforming portfolios 
the fair value of the msrs is determined based on a combination of benchmarking of servicing assets valuation surveys and cash flow modeling 
the valuation of the company s msrs incorporate two sets of assumptions market derived assumptions for discount rates  servicing costs  escrow earnings rate  float earnings rate and cost of funds and market derived assumptions adjusted for the company s loan characteristics and portfolio behavior  for escrow balances  delinquencies and foreclosures  late fees  prepayments and prepayment penalties 
for the year ended december   the msrs fair value amounted to million  which represents a value increment of million compared to december  the generalized increase in msr values was mainly driven by the increase observed in mortgage rates for the year  which in turn reduced the consensus estimate for mortgage prepayment speeds 
consistent with this market trend  prepayment speeds for the company s msr collateral decreased by about basis points when compared to the end of secondary components of the increase in msr carrying values were an increase in ancillary income offset by a decrease in float earnings and a reduction of million in unpaid principal balance of msr underlying mortgages 
ios represent the estimated present value of cash flows retained by the company that are generated by the underlying fixed rate mortgages as adjusted for prepayments after subtracting the interest rate payable to the investor adjusted for any embedded cap  if applicable  and a contractual servicing fee 
as of december  
table of contents  the carrying value of the ios of million is related to million of outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans sold to investors 
ios are classified as securities held for trading in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
to determine the value of its portfolio of variable ios  doral financial uses an internal valuation model that forecasts expected cash flows using forward libor rates derived from the libor swap yield curve at the date of the valuation 
the characteristics of the variable ios result in an increase in cash flows when libor rates fall and a reduction in cash flows when libor rates rise 
this provides a mitigating effect on the impact of prepayment speeds on the cash flows  with prepayments expected to rise when long term interest rates fall reducing the amount of expected cash flows and the opposite when long term interest rise 
prepayment assumptions incorporated into the valuation model for variable and fixed ios are based on publicly available  independently verifiable  prepayment assumptions for fnma mortgage pools and statistically derived prepayment adjusters based on observed relationships between the company s and fnma s us mainland mortgage pool prepayment experiences 
this methodology resulted in a cpr of for  for and for the change in the cpr between and was due mostly to a generalized decrease in market interest rates 
however  puerto rico prepayments speeds continue to be slower than us especially considering the persistence of recessionary conditions 
the company continues to benchmark its internal assumptions for setting its discount rate to a third party valuation provider 
a discount rate of was used for the years ended december  and  respectively  and for the corresponding period 
for ios  doral financial recognizes as interest income through the life of the io the excess of all estimated cash flows attributable to these interests over their recorded balance using the effective yield method in accordance with asc eitf no 

the company updates its estimates of expected cash flows periodically and recognizes changes in calculated effective yield on a prospective basis

as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in the table above  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments  which may magnify or offset the sensitivities 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in the fair value of the company s ios  the constant prepayment rate and the weighted average expected life under the company s valuation model  given several hypothetical instantaneous and parallel increases or decreases in interest rates 
as of december   all of the mortgage loan sale contracts underlying the company s floating rate ios were subject to interest rate caps  which prevent a negative fair value for the floating rate ios

accordingly  in a declining interest rate scenario as shown in the table above  decreases in the fair value of the interest rate caps only partially offsets the positive impact that declining interest rates would have on the fair values of the ios 
this results in net increases in the fair values of the ios 
valuation of trading securities and derivatives doral financial s net gain loss on trading activities includes gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on securities accounted for as held for trading  including ios  as well as various other financial instruments  such as derivative contracts  that doral financial uses to manage its interest rate risk 
securities held for trading and derivatives are recorded at fair values with increases or decreases in such values reflected in current earnings 
the fair values of many of doral financial s trading securities other than ios are based on market prices obtained from market data sources  such as bloomberg llp and interactive data corporation 
for instruments not traded on a recognized market  doral financial generally determines fair value by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments 
the fair values of derivative instruments are obtained using internal valuation models based on financial modeling tools and using market derived assumptions obtained from bloomberg llp

generally  derivatives are financial instruments with little or no initial net investment in comparison to their notional amount and whose value is based on the value of an underlying asset  index  reference rate or other variable 
they may be standardized contracts executed through organized exchanges or privately negotiated contractual agreements that can be customized to meet specific needs  including certain commitments to purchase and sell mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the fair value of derivatives is generally reported net by counterparty  provided that a legally enforceable master agreement exists 
derivatives in a net asset position are reported as part of securities held for trading  at fair value 
similarly  derivatives in a net liability position are reported as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities  at fair value 
for those derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge  fair value gains and losses are reported as part of net gain loss on trading activities in the consolidated statements of operations

requires an assessment of otti whenever the fair value of an investment security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date 
amortized cost basis includes adjustments made to the cost of a security for accretion  amortization  collection of cash  previous otti recognized into earnings less any cumulative effect adjustments and fair value hedge accounting adjustments 
otti is considered to have occurred under the following circumstances if the company intends to sell the investment security and its fair value is less than its amortized cost 
if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the company will decide or be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment security 
this occurs when the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
in determining whether a credit loss exists  the company uses its best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the investment security 
cash flows expected to be collected are estimated based on a careful assessment of all available information 
the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis represents the amount of credit loss 
the company evaluates its individual investment securities for otti at least on a quarterly basis 
as part of this process  the company considers its intent to sell each debt security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  the company recognizes an otti charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
for securities that meet neither of these conditions  an analysis is performed to determine if any of these securities are at risk for otti 
to determine which securities are at risk for otti and should be quantitatively evaluated utilizing a detailed cash flow analysis  the company evaluates certain indicators which consider various characteristics of each security including  but not limited to  the following the credit rating and related outlook or status of the securities  the creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities  the value and type of underlying collateral  the duration and level of the unrealized loss  any credit enhancements  and other collateral related characteristics such as the ratio of credit enhancements to expected credit losses 
the relative importance of this information varies based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each security  as well as the economic environment at the time of assessment 
the difference between the estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis is considered to be a credit loss 

table of contents other income recognition policies interest income on loans is accrued by doral financial when earned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when any portion of principal or interest is more than days past due  except for revolving lines of credit and credit cards until days past due and fha and va loans until days past due  or earlier if concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is fully reversed 
such interest  if collected  is credited to income in the period of recovery 
loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully collectible 
loan origination fees  as well as discount points and certain direct origination costs for loans held for sale  are initially recorded as an adjustment to the cost of the loan and reflected in doral financial s earnings as part of the net gain on mortgage loan sales and fees when the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security

allowance for loan and lease losses doral financial maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb probable credit related losses on its loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance consists of specific and general components and is based on doral financial s assessment of default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level that doral financial considers to be adequate to absorb probable losses 
credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance  while increases to the allowance are charged to operations 
unanticipated increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could adversely impact doral financial s net income in the future

commercial and construction loans over million that are classified as substandard are evaluated individually for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events it is probable that the borrower will not be able to fulfill its obligation according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is generally measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  the company is required to measure the impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the collateral is generally obtained from appraisals or estimated using an appraisal like methodology see below 
consistent with management s intention of preserving capital  its strategy is to maximize proceeds from the disposition of foreclosed assets as opposed to rapid liquidation 
accordingly  the market value of appraisals is used 
should the appraisal show a deficiency  the company records a specific reserve for the underlying loan 
when current appraisals are not available  management estimates the fair value of the collateral giving consideration to several factors including the price at which individual units could be sold in the current market  the period of time over which the units would be sold  the estimated cost to complete the units  the risks associated with completing and selling the units  the required return on the investment a potential acquirer may have and current market interest rates in the puerto rico market 
doral financial s mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of homogeneous loans that are secured by residential real estate and are made to consumers

estimated recourse obligation prior to  the company normally sold mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities subject to recourse provisions 
pursuant to these recourse arrangements  the company agreed to retain or share the credit risk with the purchaser of such mortgage loans for a specified period or up to a certain percentage of the total amount in loans sold 
the company estimates the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or any liability incurred at the time of sale and includes such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in lower gain on sale recognition 
doral financial recognized the fair value of its recourse obligation by estimating the amount that the company would be required to pay for mortgage insurance from a third party in order to be relieved of its estimated recourse exposure on these loans 
during the third quarter of  doral financial refined its estimate for determining expected losses from recourse obligations as it began to develop more data regarding historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
this actual data on losses showed a substantially different experience than that used for newer loans for which insurance quotes are published 
the company believes that this method resulted in an adequate valuation of its recourse allowance as of december  and  but actual future recourse obligations may be different and a different result may have been obtained if the company had used another method for estimating this liability 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on current tax laws 
to the extent tax laws change  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted  as necessary  in the period that the tax change is enacted 
the company recognizes income tax benefits when the realization of such benefits is probable 
a valuation allowance is recognized for any deferred tax asset which  based on management s evaluation  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets the company considers  among other matters  all sources of taxable income  including the future reversal of existing temporary differences  future taxable income  carryforwards and tax planning strategies 
in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset  the company evaluates both positive and negative evidence regarding the ability of the company to generate sufficient taxable income 
the amount of the valuation allowance has been determined based on our estimates of taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december   and net interest income net interest income is the excess of interest earned by doral financial on its interest earning assets over the interest incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
doral financial s net interest income is subject to interest rate risk due to the repricing and maturity mismatch in the company s assets and liabilities 
generally  doral financial s assets have a longer maturity and a later repricing date than its liabilities  which results in lower net interest income in periods of rising short term interest rates and higher net interest income in periods of declining short term interest rates 
please refer to risk management below for additional information on the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
net interest income for the years  and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
compared to doral financial s net interest income for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease in net interest income resulted from a reduction in interest income of million  partially offset by a reduction in interest expense of million 
the reduction in interest income was principally related to i a reduction of million in interest income on investment securities primarily due to a reduction in the average balance of investment securities of million as a result of sales  calls and the settlement of the position with lehman during the full impact of which was reflected in  ii an increase of million in interest on mortgage backed securities resulted from the net effect and timing of the sale of approximately billion of securities and the purchase of approximately billion of securities during the year for the purpose of increasing interest margins in the first six months and reducing the company s interest rate exposure in the latter part of the year  iii a decrease in interest on loans of million compared to december primarily related to the lower interest rate environment and an increase in non performing loans in the company s loan portfolio  and iv a decrease of million in interest income on other interest earning assets was due to a net decrease of million in the average balance of other interest earning assets 
the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of million for the year ended december   when compared to the corresponding period 
the decrease in interest expense was driven by i a reduction of million in interest expense on deposits driven by the rollover of maturing brokered cds at lower current market rates even though the company lengthened maturities  as well as shifts in the composition of the company s retail deposits and the general decline in interest rates  ii a reduction of million in interest expense on securities sold under agreements to repurchase driven by the general decline in interest rates  iii a decrease of million in interest on advances from fhlb resulted primarily from the general decline in interest rates that allowed the company to maintain its balance of advances at lower fixed rates  iv an increase of million in interest on short term borrowings directly related to the increase of billion in the average balance of short term borrowings during compared to the previous year  and v a decrease of million in interest on loans payable due to a reduction in the average balance of loans payable of million as a result of repayment of loans and lower interest rates 
average interest earning assets increased from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the corresponding period 
the reduction in leverage combined with a decline in net interest income of million during  resulted in a contraction of the net interest margin from for the year ended december  to in the corresponding period 
compared to doral financial s net interest income for the year ended december   increased by million  or  compared to the increase in net interest income was principally due to a faster decline in interest expense than interest income during a period of declining interest rates 
this is because company s interest bearing assets on average have longer re pricing periods than its interest bearing liabilities 
another principal factor was the reduction in the company s leverage resulting from the repayment of million in senior notes in july which was funded primarily with a million capital raise 
the company also reduced its leverage through the sale of investment securities during the latter half of as part of the company s interest rate risk management efforts and the reduction in investments securities in the latter half of associated with the liquidation of lehman brothers inc and the exercise of call options by issuers on bonds owned by the

provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan and lease losses to a level considered appropriate by management considering all losses inherent in the portfolio and based on doral financial s historical loss experience  current delinquency rates  known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  an assessment of individual troubled loans  the estimated value of the underlying collateral or discounted expected cash flows  and an assessment of current economic conditions and emerging risks 
while management believes that the current allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate  future additions to the allowance could be necessary if economic conditions change or if credit losses increase substantially from those forecasted by doral financial in determining the allowance 
unanticipated increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could materially affect doral financial s net income in future periods 
compared to doral financial s provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december  amounted to million  compared to million for the corresponding period  an increase of million  or 
for  the provision of all portfolios increased except for the provision for the commercial real estate loan portfolio which is the portfolio where a higher provision was established at the end of the level of the provision in was largely driven by higher delinquencies primarily in the construction  residential mortgage and commercial loan portfolios during the period and continued deterioration in the puerto rico economy 
please refer to the discussions under credit risk for further analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses and non performing assets and related ratios 
mortgage lending is the company s principal line of business and has historically reflected low levels of losses 
nevertheless  due to current economic conditions in puerto rico  which have resulted in higher non performing loans and loss severities in the residential mortgage loan portfolio  the company increased its allowance and provision for loan and lease losses for this portfolio during perhaps the sector of the economy most affecting doral financial  directly and indirectly  is the sale of new home construction in puerto rico 
for the year ended december   the market absorption of new construction homes decreased significantly  principally due to the termination  late in the fourth quarter of  of the tax incentive provided by law this circumstance required modifications in absorption estimates  resulting in higher loan loss provisions 
furthermore  the slowdown in new construction has resulted in lost jobs  which has further increased mortgage and commercial loan delinquencies as the overall level of economic activity declines 
the company expects that absorption will continue to be at low levels due to the current economic environment 
in optimizing its recovery of non performing construction loans  as of december   management has determined to foreclose approximately non performing residential development properties with an outstanding balance of approximately million in order to accelerate sales of the individual units 
most of these projects are in a mature stage of the development with approximately complete or close to completion 
if foreclosure is probable  accounting guidance requires the measurement of impairment to be based on the fair value of the collateral 
since current appraisals were not available on all these properties at year end  management determined its loss reserve estimates for these loans by estimating the fair value of the collateral

income taxes the recognition of current income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  resulted from a current income tax benefit of million and a deferred income tax benefit of million 
the current income tax benefit is primarily related to the release of unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax positions net of the recognition of certain unrecognized tax benefits during the year 
this net benefit was partially offset by the recognition of tax expense related to intercompany transactions in the federal tax jurisdiction which had not been previously recognized net of current tax benefit related to the company s us affiliates 
the deferred tax benefit is primarily related to the effect of the company entering into an agreement with the puerto rico treasury 
table of contents department during the third quarter of amending the previous agreement regarding amortization of certain prepaid taxes  net of the amortization of existing deferred tax assets 
as of december   one of the company s puerto rico taxable entities remained in a cumulative loss position in earnings before tax two entities were in a cumulative loss positions as of december  
for purposes of assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets  this cumulative taxable loss position for this entity is considered significant negative evidence that has caused management to conclude that the company will not be able to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to those two entities in the future  considering the criteria of asc income taxes  previously sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

accordingly  as of december  and  the company determined that it was more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of its gross deferred tax assets would not be realized and maintained a valuation allowance for that amount 
for the entity that no longer remained in a cumulative loss position in  the company decided to maintain the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets until it reflects a steady return to profitability 
for puerto rico taxable entities with positive core earnings  a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets has not been recorded since they are expected to continue to be profitable 
at december   the net deferred tax asset associated with these two companies was million  compared to million at december  approximately  million of the io tax asset would be realized through these entities 
in management s opinion  for these companies  the positive evidence of profitable core earnings outweighs any negative evidence 
there is also a valuation allowance of million related to deferred taxes on unrealized losses on cash flow hedges as of december  for the year ended december   income tax expense of million was primarily related to a charge through earnings of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of approximately million 
this valuation allowance was established because two of the company s puerto rico taxable entities had a cumulative loss in earnings before tax 
for purposes of assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets  the cumulative taxable loss postion for these two entities are considered significant negative evidence and have caused management to conclude that the company will not be able to rully realize the deferred tax assets related to those two entities in the future 
accordingly  as of december   the company determined that it was more likely than not that million of its gross deferred tax asset would not be realized and maintained a valuation allowance for that amount 
for the year ended december   the company had an income tax benefit of million related to an increase in the deferred tax asset and the release of the valuation allowance 
after the recapitalization and corporate reorganization  the company started operating under a different business model which enabled it to achieve significant improvements in its operating results during the latter half of the positive operating results together with the tax agreements with the puerto rico treasury department enabled the company to reduce its valuation allowance during management does not establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets generated on the unrealized losses of its securities available for sale because the company does not intend to sell the securities before recovery of value  and based on available evidence it is not more likely than not that the company will decide or be required to sell the securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
management has therefore determined that a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets generated on the unrealized losses of its securities available for sale is not necessary at this time 
failure to achieve sufficient projected taxable income in the entities where a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets has not been established  might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax asset 
management assesses the realization of its deferred tax assets at each reporting period based on the criteria of asc sfas no 
 to the extent that earnings improve and the deferred tax assets become realizable  the company may be able to reduce the valuation allowance through earnings

the decrease in doral financial s loan production for the year ended december  resulted from significant decreases in residential mortgage and construction lending activity in puerto rico  partially offset by an increase in the commercial production related to participation in syndicated loans in the us mainland 
the decrease in the company s internally originated loans is due to a number of factors including deteriorating economic conditions  competition from other financial institutions  changes in laws and regulations and the general economic conditions in puerto rico

doral financial s future results could be adversely affected by a significant increase in mortgage interest rates that may reduce refinancing activity

gnma programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the company provides servicing 
at the company s option and without gnma prior authorization  doral financial may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to of the loan s remaining principal balance 
this buy back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met  at which time the option becomes unconditional but not an obligation 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized  the company treats the transaction as a sale for accounting purposes and the loans are removed from the balance sheet because the conditional nature of the buy back option means that the company does not maintain effective control over the loans 
when individual loans later meet gnma s specified delinquency criteria and are eligible for repurchase  doral financial is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
in such case  for financial reporting purposes  the delinquent gnma loans are brought back into the company s portfolio of loans held for sale  regardless of whether the company intends to exercise the buy back option 
an offsetting liability is also recorded

the average life of these loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and  with respect to conventional mortgage loans  due on sale clauses  which give doral financial the right to declare a conventional mortgage loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when current mortgage loan rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans 
under the latter circumstance  the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates

requires an assessment of otti whenever the fair value of an investment security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date 
amortized cost basis includes adjustments made to the cost of a security for accretion  amortization  collection of cash  previous otti recognized into earnings less any cumulative effect adjustments and fair value hedge accounting adjustments 
otti is considered to have occurred under any of the following circumstances if the company intends to sell the investment security and its fair value is less than its amortized cost 
if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the company will decide or be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment security 
this occurs when the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
in determining whether a credit loss exists  the company uses its best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the investment security 
cash flows expected to be collected are 
table of contents estimated based on a careful assessment of all available information 
the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis represents the amount of credit loss 
the company evaluates its individual available for sale investment securities for otti on at least a quarterly basis 
as part of this process  the company considers its intent to sell each debt security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  the company recognizes an otti charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
for securities that meet neither of these conditions  an analysis is performed to determine if any of these securities are at risk for otti 
to determine which securities are at risk for otti and should be quantitatively evaluated utilizing a detailed cash flow analysis  the company evaluates certain indicators which consider various characteristics of each security including  but not limited to  the following the credit rating and related outlook or status of the securities  the creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities  the value and type of underlying collateral  the duration and level of the unrealized loss  any credit enhancements  and other collateral related characteristics such as the ratio of credit enhancements to expected credit losses 
the relative importance of this information varies based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each security  as well as the economic environment at the time of assessment 
the difference between the estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis is considered to be a credit loss 
as of december   the company performed a detailed cash flow analysis to assess whether any of the securities were otti 
the company uses a third party provider to generate cash flow forecasts of each security reviewed based on a combination of management and market driven assumptions and securitization terms  including remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the estimated amount of loans to become seriously delinquent over the life of the security and the pull through rate  the estimated life time severity rate  estimated losses over the life of the security  loan characteristics  the level of subordination within the security structure  expected housing price changes and interest rate assumptions 
for the year ended december   it was determined that seven securities reflected otti 
four of these securities are subordinated interests in a securitization structure collateralized by option adjustable rate mortgage arm loans 
the security characteristics that led to the otti conclusion included the cumulative level and estimated future delinquency levels  the effect of severely delinquent loans on forecasted defaults  the cumulative severity and expected severity in resolving the defaulted loans  the current subordination of the securities and the present value of the forecast cash flows was less than the cost basis of the security 
management estimates that credit losses of million had been incurred on these securities with amortized cost of million as of december  it is possible that future loss assumptions or securitization cash flow estimates could change and cause future otti charges on these securities 
non agency cmo s also include pr non agency cmo s with a market value of million that are comprised of subordinate tranches of securitizations of doral originated mortgage loans primarily composed of and vintages 
doral purchased these cmos at a discounted price of of par value  anticipating a partial loss of principal and interest value and as a result  accounted for these investments under the guidance of asc  investments other beneficial interest in securitized financial assets  previously eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets eitf no 
 as amended by fsp no 
eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 

the remaining three securities that reflected otti during are pr non agency cmo s 
management estimates that credit losses of million had been incurred on these securities with amortized cost of million as of december  it is possible that future loss assumptions could change and cause future other than temporary impairment charges in these securities 
higher default and loss assumptions driven by higher delinquencies in puerto rico  primarily due to the impact of inflationary pressures on the consumer  the high rate of unemployment and general recessionary conditions on the island  has resulted in higher default and loss estimates on these bonds 
the higher default and loss estimates have resulted in lower bond prices and higher levels of unrealized losses on the bonds 
these changes have caused the securitization s cash flow waterfall to accelerate repayment of senior issues of certain securitizations 
the company does not intend to sell the securities which it has judged to be otti and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before its anticipated recovery of each security s remaining amortized 
table of contents cost basis 
therefore  the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of estimated future cash flows is recorded as a credit related otti of the securities 
for the remainder of the company s securities portfolio that have experienced decreases in fair value  the decline is considered to be temporary as the company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on the securities and neither intends to sell these securities nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities 
in subsequent periods the company will account for the securities judged to be otti as if the securities had been purchased at the previous amortized cost less the credit related otti 
once a credit loss is recognized  the investment will be adjusted to a new amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the amount recognized in earnings 
for the investment securities for which otti was recognized in earnings  the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected will be accreted as interest income

table of contents the reduction in total average rate on deposits for the year ended december  was driven by the decline in interest rates during  when compared to the corresponding period 
during the second quarter of  the company repriced most retail and commercial deposits

brokered deposits are used by doral financial s retail banking subsidiaries as a source of long term funds  and doral financial s retail banking subsidiaries have traditionally been able to replace maturing brokered deposits 
brokered deposits  however  are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core deposits obtained through retail bank branches 
brokered deposit investors are generally very sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds from one depository institution to another based on minor differences in rates offered on deposits 
doral financial s banking subsidiaries  as members of the fhlb ny  have access to collateralized borrowings from the fhlb ny up to a maximum of of total assets

doral financial also derives liquidity from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market 
the us including puerto rico secondary mortgage market is the most liquid in the world in large part because of the sale or guarantee programs maintained by fha  va  hud  fnma and fhlmc

while doral financial generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements within days  it must absorb the cost of funding the advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
for the year ended december   the monthly average amount of funds advanced by doral financial under such servicing agreements was approximately million  compared to million for to the extent the mortgage loans underlying doral financial s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies  doral financial would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts 
in the past  doral financial sold pools of delinquent fha and va and conventional mortgage loans 
under these arrangements  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial expects to recover the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha va loans  under the applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of the delinquent status of the loans 
as of december  and  the outstanding principal balance of such delinquent loans was million and million  respectively  and the average annual amount of funds advanced by doral financial was million and million  respectively 
when doral financial sells mortgage loans to third parties  which serves as a source of cash  it also generally makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics  investors are generally entitled to cause doral financial to repurchase such loans 
in addition to its servicing and warranty obligations  in the past doral financial s loan sale activities have included the sale of non conforming mortgage loans subject to recourse arrangements that generally require doral financial to repurchase or substitute the loans if the loans are days or more past due or otherwise in default up to a specified amount or limited to a period of time after the sale 
to the extent the delinquency ratios of the loans sold subject to recourse are greater than anticipated and doral financial is required to repurchase more loans than anticipated  doral financial s liquidity requirements would increase 
please refer to off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 
in the past  doral financial sold or securitized mortgage loans with fnma on a partial or full recourse basis 
doral financial s contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require doral financial to post collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities to secure such recourse obligation to the extent doral financial does not maintain an investment grade rating 
as of december   doral financial s maximum recourse exposure with fnma amounted to million and required the posting of a minimum of million in collateral to secure recourse obligations 
while deemed unlikely by doral financial  fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of doral financial s recourse obligations

off balance sheet activities in the ordinary course of the business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans at the time of the loan sales to third parties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold  and in certain circumstances  such as in the event of early or first payment default 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics  if there is a breach of contract of a representation or warranty or if there is an early payment default  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan

risk factors  risks relating to our business defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition for additional information 
in the past  in relation to its asset securitization and loan sale activities  the company sold pools of delinquent fha  va and conventional mortgage loans on a servicing retained basis 
following these transactions  the loans are not reflected on doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
under these arrangements  as part of its servicing responsibilities  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments of principal and interest whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial expects to recover a significant portion of the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha and va loans  under applicable the fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of delinquent status of the loans 
as of december  and  the outstanding principal balance of such delinquent loans amounted to million and million  respectively 
in addition  doral financial s loan sale activities in the past included certain mortgage loan sale and securitization transactions subject to recourse arrangements that require doral financial to repurchase or substitute the loan if the loans are days or more past due or otherwise in default 
the company is also required to pay interest on delinquent loans in the form of servicing advances 
under certain of these arrangements  the recourse obligation is terminated upon compliance with certain conditions  which generally involve i the lapse of time normally from four to seven years  ii the lapse of time combined with certain other conditions such as the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loans falling below a specific percentage normally less than of the appraised value of the underlying property or iii the amount of loans repurchased pursuant to recourse provisions reaching a specific percentage of the original principal amount of loans sold generally from to 
as of december  and  the company s records reflected that the outstanding principal balance of loans sold subject to full or partial recourse was billion and billion  respectively 
as of such date  the company s records also reflected that the maximum contractual exposure to doral financial if it were required to repurchase all loans subject to recourse was billion and billion  respectively

the company discontinued the practice of selling loans with recourse obligations in doral financial s current strategy is to sell loans on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early payment defaults 
for the years ended december  and  the company repurchased at fair value million and million  respectively  pursuant to recourse provisions 
the company s approach for estimating its liability for expected losses from recourse obligations was based on the amount that would be required to pay for mortgage insurance to a third party in order to be relieved of its recourse exposure on these loans 
during the third quarter of  doral financial refined its estimate for determining expected losses from recourse obligations as it began to develop more data regarding historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
this actual data on losses showed a substantially different experience than that used for newer loans for which insurance quotes are published 
doral financial reserves for its exposure to recourse amounted to million and million and the other credit enhanced transactions explained above amounted million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the change in the approach used to estimate the extent of the expected losses from recourse resulted in a million change in the underlying reserves for the year ended december  for additional information regarding sales of delinquent loans please refer to liquidity and capital resources above

these financial instruments may include commitments to extend credit and sell loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position 
the contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the company has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the company s exposure to credit losses in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit or for forward sales is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
doral financial uses the same credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as the conditions established in the contract are met 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
generally  the company does not enter into interest rate lock agreements with borrowers 
the company purchases mortgage loans and simultaneously enters into a sale and securitization agreement with the same counterparty  essentially a forward contract that meets the definition of a derivative under asc  derivatives and hedging  previously sfas no

table of contents risk management doral financial s business is subject to four broad categories of risks interest rate risk  credit risk  operational risk and liquidity risk 
doral financial has specific policies and procedures which have been designed to identify  measure and manage risks to which the company is exposed 
interest rate and market risk management interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates may adversely affect the value of doral financial s assets and liabilities and its net interest income 
doral financial s risk management policies are designed with the goal of maximizing shareholder value with emphasis on stability of net interest income and market value of equity 
these policies are also targeted to remain well capitalized  preserve adequate liquidity  and meet various regulatory requirements 
the objectives of doral financial s risk management policies are pursued within the limits established by the board of directors of the company 
the board of directors has delegated the oversight of interest rate and liquidity risks to its risk policy committee 
doral financial s asset liability management committee alco has been created under the authority of the board of directors to manage the company s interest rate  market and liquidity risk 
the alco is primarily responsible for ensuring that doral financial operates within the company s established asset liability management policy guidelines and procedures 
the alco reports directly to the risk policy committee of the board of directors 
the alco is responsible for developing the company s asset liability management and liquidity strategy  monitoring and management of interest rate  pricing and liquidity risk limits to ensure compliance with the company s policies  overseeing product pricing and volume objectives for banking and treasury activities  and overseeing the maintenance of management information systems that supply relevant information for the alco to fulfill its responsibilities as it relates to asset liability management 
risk identification measurement and control doral financial manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis 
changes in interest rates can affect the volume of doral financial s mortgage loan originations  the net interest income earned on doral financial s portfolio of loans and securities  the amount of gain on the sale of loans and the value of doral financial s servicing assets  loans  investment securities and other retained interests 
as part of its interest rate risk management practices  doral financial has implemented measures to identify the interest rate risk associated with the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet activities 
the company has also developed policies and procedures to control and manage these risks and continues to improve its interest rate risk management practices 
the company currently manages its interest rate risk by focusing on the following metrics a net interest income sensitivity  b market value equity sensitivity  c effective duration of equity  and d maturity repricing gaps 
doral financial s asset liability management policies provide a limit structure based on these four metrics 
a single limit is defined for effective duration of equity 
net interest income sensitivity limits are set for instantaneous parallel rate shifts 
specific parallel rate shifts defined for net interest income and market value equity limits are bps  bps  bps  bps  bps  and bps 
net interest income sensitivity limits are established for different time horizons 
additional limits are defined for maturity repricing mismatches  however  management continues to emphasize risk management and controls based on net interest income and market value of equity sensitivity as these measures incorporate the effect of existing asset liability 
table of contents mismatches 
the explanations below provide a brief description of the metrics used by the company and the methodologies assumptions employed in the estimation of these metrics net interest income sensitivity 
refers to the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the maturity mismatches and repricing characteristics of doral financial s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
to measure net interest income exposure to changes in market interest rates  the company uses earnings simulation techniques 
these simulation techniques allow for the forecasting of net interest income and expenses under various rate scenarios for the measurement of interest rate risk exposures of doral financial 
primary scenarios include instantaneous parallel and non parallel rate shocks 
net interest income sensitivity is measured for time horizons ranging from twelve to sixty months and as such  serves as a measure of short to medium term earnings risk 
the basic underlying assumptions used in net interest income simulations are a the company maintains a static balance sheet  b full reinvestment of funds in similar product instruments with similar maturity and repricing characteristics  c spread assumed constant  d prepayment rates on mortgages and mortgage related securities are modeled using multi factor prepayment model  e non maturity deposit decay and price elasticity assumptions are incorporated  and f effect of embedded options is also taken into consideration 
to complement and broaden the analysis of earnings at risk the company also performs earning simulations for longer time horizons 
market value of equity sensitivity 
used to capture and measure the risks associated with longer term maturity and re pricing mismatches 
doral financial uses value simulations techniques for all financial components of the statement of financial condition 
valuation techniques include static cash flows analyses  stochastic models to qualify value of embedded options and prepayment modeling 
to complement and broaden the risk analysis  the company uses duration and convexity analysis to measure the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
duration measures the linear change in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates  while  convexity measures the asymmetric changes in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates due to the presence of options 
the analysis of duration and convexity combined provide a better understanding of the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
effective duration of equity 
the effective duration of equity is a broad measure of the impact of interest rates changes on doral financial s economic capital 
the measure summarizes the net sensitivity of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet positions 
interest rate risk management strategy doral financial s current interest rate management strategy is implemented by the alco and is focused on reducing the volatility of the company s earnings and to protect the market value of equity 
while the current strategy will also use a combination of derivatives and balance sheet management  more emphasis is placed on balance sheet management 
net interest income risk 
in order to protect net interest income against interest rate risk  the alco employs a number of tactics which are evaluated and adjusted in relation to prevailing market conditions 
internal balance sheet management practices are designed to reduce the re pricing gaps of the company s assets and liabilities 
however  the company may also use derivatives  mainly interest rate swaps and interest rate caps  as part of its interest rate risk management activities 
interest rate swaps represent a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party pays fixed rate and the other pays a floating rate 
for net interest income protection  doral financial typically pays a fixed rate payer float receiver swaps to eliminate the variability of cash flows associated to floating rate debt obligations 
market value of equity hedging strategies 
due to the composition of doral financial s assets and liabilities  the company has earnings exposure to rising interest rates 
the company measures the market value of all rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions  and the difference between assets and liabilities  adjusted by off balance sheet positions  is termed market value of equity 
the company measures how the market value of equity fluctuates with different rate scenarios to measure risk exposure of economic capital or market value of equity 

table of contents management uses duration matching strategies to manage the fluctuations of market value of equity within the long term targets established by the board of directors of the company 
duration risk 
duration is a measure of the impact in magnitude and direction of changes in interest rates on the economic values of financial instruments 
in order to bring duration measures within the policy thresholds established by the company  management may use a combination of internal liabilities management techniques and derivatives instruments 
the derivatives such as interest rate swaps  treasury futures  eurodollar futures and forward contracts may be entered into as part of the company s risk management 
convexity risk 
convexity is a measure of how much duration changes as interest rates change 
for doral financial  convexity risk primarily results from mortgage prepayment risk 
as part of managing convexity risk management may use a combination of internal balance sheet management instruments or derivatives  such as swaptions  caps  floors  put or call options on interest rate indexes or related fixed income underlying securities ie eurodollar  treasury notes 
hedging related to mortgage banking activities 
as part of doral financial s risk management of mortgage banking activities  such as secondary market and servicing assets  the company enters into forward agreements to buy or sell mortgage backed securities to protect the company against changes in interest rates that may impact the economic value of servicing assets or the pricing of marketable loan production 
hedging the various sources of interest rate risks related to mortgage banking activities is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling  continuous monitoring and active management 
while doral financial balances and manages the various aspects relating to mortgage activities  there are potential risks to earnings associated to them 
the following bullets summarize some of these potential risks the valuation of msrs are recorded in earnings immediately within the accounting period in which the changes in value occur  whereas the impact of changes in interest rates are reflected in originations with a time lag and effects on servicing fee income occurs over time 
thus  even when mortgage activities could be protected from adverse changes in interest rates over a period of time on a cumulative basis they may display large variations in income from period to period 
the degree to which the natural hedge associated to mortgage banking ie originating and servicing offsets changes in servicing asset valuations may be imperfect  as it may vary over time 
origination volumes  the valuation of servicing assets  economic hedging activities and other related costs are impacted by multiple factors  which include  changes in the mix of new business  changes in the term structure of interest rates  changes in mortgage spreads mortgage basis to other rate benchmarks  and rate volatility  among others 
interrelation of all these factors is hard to predict and  as such  the ability to perfectly hedge their effects is limited 
doral financial s risk profile doral financial s goal is to manage market and interest rate risk within targeted levels established and periodically reviewed by the board of directors 
the interest risk profile of the company is managed by using natural offsets generated by the different components of the balance sheet during the natural course of business operations and through active hedging activities using debt and derivative instruments to achieve targeted risk levels 
the company s interest rate risk exposure can be symmetric or asymmetric based on the varying changes to the market value of equity due to changes in interest rates 
the asymmetric risks arise primarily from embedded optionality in our products and transactions which allows clients and counterparties to modify the maturity of loans  securities  deposits and or borrowings 
examples of asymmetric risks include the ability of a mortgagee to prepay his her mortgage or a counterparty exercising its puttable option on a structured transaction 
the embedded optionality is primarily managed by purchasing or selling options or by other active risk management strategies involving the use of derivatives  including the forward sale of mortgage backed securities 

table of contents the tables below show the risk profile of doral financial taking into account the derivatives set forth below under basis point parallel and instantaneous increases or decreases of interest rates  as of december  and market value net interest as of december  of equity risk income risk bps bps market value net interest as of december  of equity risk income risk bps bps based on a month forward change in net interest income 
as of december  the market value of equity mve showed greater sensitivity to rising interest rates when compared to december  this change in the mve sensitivity is driven by growth in the mortgage loan portfolio and the change in the mix of the investment porfolio 
the company has been actively managing the balance sheet to maintain the interest rate risk measures within policy limits mainly by restructuring investment portfolios and increased focus on liability extensions 
the net interest income nii sensitivity measure  based on a month horizon  changed from to for a basis point rate increase when comparing december  to december  the effect is explained partly due to the change in repricing characteristics of investment securities as the company sold the majority of the floating rate securities it had as of december   while continuing to focus on actively managing funding mismatches through funding extensions 
although doral s risk profile continues to have liability sensitivity in a month time horizon the earnings sensitivity was reduced by percentage points

as described above  doral financial uses derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risk caused by changes in interest rates 
derivatives are generally either privately negotiated over the counter otc contracts or standard contracts transacted through regulated exchanges 
otc contracts generally consist of swaps  caps and collars  forwards and options 
exchange traded derivatives include futures and options 
the company is subject to various interest rate cap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure 
interest rate cap agreements generally involve purchase of out of the money caps to protect the company from larger rate moves and to provide the company with positive convexity 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk 
the following table summarizes the company s interest rate caps outstanding at december

interest rate swap agreements generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal 
the company principally uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk

doral financial uses derivatives to manage market risk and generally accounts for such instruments on a mark to market basis with gains or losses charged to current operations as part of net gain loss on securities held for trading as they occur 
contracts with positive fair values are recorded as assets and contracts with negative fair values as liabilities  after the application of netting arrangements 
fair values of derivatives such as interest rate futures contracts or options are determined by reference to market prices 
fair values for derivatives purchased in the over the counter market are determined by valuation models and validated with prices provided by external sources 
the notional amounts of freestanding derivatives totaled million and million  respectively  as of december  and notional amounts indicate the volume of derivatives activity  but do not represent doral financial s exposure to market or credit risk 
the increase in the notional amount of 
table of contents freestanding derivatives with respect to december  is due mainly to economic hedges related to servicing assets and secondary marketing activities 
derivatives hedge accounting 
doral financial seeks to designate derivatives under hedge accounting guidelines when it can clearly identify an asset or liability that can be hedged pursuant to the strict hedge accounting guidelines 
the notional amounts of swaps treated under hedge accounting totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company typically uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate fhlb advances to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating swaps 
in these cases  the company matches all of the terms in the fhlb advance to the floating leg of the interest rate swap 
since both transactions are symmetrically opposite the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is high

table of contents the use of derivatives involves market and credit risk 
the market risk of derivatives arises principally from the potential for changes in the value of derivative contracts based on changes in interest rates 
the credit risk of otc derivatives arises from the potential of counterparties to default on their contractual obligations 
to manage this credit risk  doral financial deals with counterparties of good credit standing  enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and monitors mark to market on pledge collateral to minimize credit exposures 
master netting agreements incorporate rights of set off that provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default 
as a result of the ratings downgrades affecting doral financial  counterparties to derivatives contracts used for interest risk management purposes could increase the applicable margin requirements under such contracts  or could require the company to terminate such agreements

credit risk doral financial is subject to credit risk with respect to its portfolio of investment securities and loans receivable 
for a discussion of credit risk on investment securities please refer to note of the accompanying financial statements 
loans receivable are loans that doral financial holds for investment and  therefore  the company is at risk for the term of the loans 
with respect to mortgage loans originated for sale as part of its mortgage banking business  doral financial is generally at risk for any mortgage loan default from the time it originates the mortgage loan until the time it sells the loan or packages it into a mortgage backed security 
with respect to fha loans  doral financial is fully insured as to principal by the fha against foreclosure loss 
va loans are guaranteed within a range of to of the principal amount of the loan subject to a maximum  ranging from  to  in addition to the mortgage collateral 
prior to  the company sold loans on a recourse basis as part of the ordinary course of business 
as part of such transactions  the company committed to make payments to remedy loan defaults or to repurchase defaulted loans 
please refer to off balance sheet activities above for additional information regarding recourse obligations 
in 
table of contents mid  the company discontinued the practice of selling mortgage loans with recourse  except for recourse related to early payments defaults 
the residential mortgage portfolio includes loans that  at some point were repurchased pursuant to recourse obligations and  as a result  have a higher credit risk 
repurchases of delinquent loans from recourse obligations for the year ended december  amounted to million and resulted in a loss of million 
when repurchased from recourse obligations  loans are recorded at their market value  which includes a discount for poor credit performance 
doral financial has historically provided land acquisition  development  and construction financing to developers of residential housing projects and  as consequence  has a relatively high credit risk exposure to this sector 
construction loans extended to developers are typically adjustable rate loans  indexed to the prime interest rate with terms ranging generally from to months 
doral financial principally targeted developers of residential construction for single family primary home occupancy 
as a result of the negative outlook for the puerto rico economy and its adverse effect on the construction industry  in the fourth quarter of  the company ceased financing new housing projects in puerto rico 
as a result  the exposure to the residential construction sector has decreased from million as of december   to million as of december  management expects that the amounts of loans and exposure of the construction industry will continue to decrease in subsequent years 
for the year ended december   absorption trends decreased significantly principally due to the termination of the tax incentive provided by law in the fourth quarter of absorption for the year ended december  reflects an reduction versus the corresponding period 
this event required modifications in absorption estimates  resulting in higher loss provisions 
the company expects that absorption will continue to be at low levels due to the current economic environment 
in optimizing its recovery of non performing construction loans  as of december   management has determined to foreclose approximately non performing residential development properties with an outstanding balance of approximately million in order to accelerate sales of the individual units 
most of these projects are in a mature stage of the development with approximately complete or close to completion 
if foreclosure is probable  accounting guidance requires the measurement of impairment to be based on the fair value of the collateral 
since current appraisals were not available on all these properties at year end  management determined its loss reserve estimates for these loans by estimating the fair value of the collateral 
in doing so  management considered a number of factors including the price at which individual units could be sold in the current market  the period of time over which the units would be sold  the estimated cost to complete the units  the risks associated with completing and selling the units  the required rate of return on investment a potential acquirer may have and current market interest rates in the puerto rico market 
management continues to evaluate the best course of action to optimize loan recoveries on all non performing properties  and will regularly assess all projects in choosing its course of action 
because most of doral financial s loans are made to borrowers located in puerto rico and secured by properties located in puerto rico  the company is subject to credit risks tied to adverse economic  political or business developments and natural hazards  such as hurricanes  that may affect puerto rico 
puerto rico economy has been in a recession since this has affected borrowers disposable incomes and their ability to make payments when due  causing an increase in delinquency and foreclosures rates 
the company believes that these conditions will continue to affect its credit quality 
in addition  there is evidence that property values have declined from their peak 
this has reduced borrowers capacity to refinance and increased the exposure to loss upon default 
this decline in prices and increases in expected defaults are incorporated into the loss rates used for calculating the company s allowance for loan and lease losses 
doral financial mitigates loan defaults on its construction and commercial portfolios through its loan workout function 
the function s main responsibilities are avoiding defaults and minimizing losses upon default of relatively large credit relationships 
the group utilizes relationship officers  collection specialists  attorneys and has contracted with third party service providers to supplement its internal resources 
in the case of residential construction projects  the workout function monitors project specifics  such as project management and marketing  as deemed necessary 
with respect to residential mortgages  the company has developed collection and loss mitigation strategies 

table of contents the company also engages in the restructuring and or modifications of the debt of borrowers  who are delinquent due to economic or legal reasons  if the company determines that it is in the best interest for both the company and the borrower to do so 
in some cases  due the nature of the borrower s financial condition  the restructure or loan modification fits the definition of tdr as defined by the asc previously sfas no 

such restructures are identified as tdrs and accounted for based on the provisions asc previously sfas no 

during the fourth quarter of  the company started a loan restructuring program the program with the purpose of aiding borrowers with delinquent mortgage loans get back into financial stability 
under the program  borrowers that prove future payment capacity would be given the opportunity of transferring past due amounts to the end of the term of the loan and place their loan in current status 
under the program  the company is not reducing rates or forgiving principal or interest  it is simply shifting past due payments to the end of the loan for a fee 
the program was designed to comply with all laws and regulations 
for purposes of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the related provision  the company has made the determination that program fits under the definition of tdr 
under asc  once restructured  tdrs are to be considered impaired and therefore treated for allowance for loan and lease losses purposes following the guidelines of asc sfas no 

under an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows  these loans would yield a present value equal to their unpaid principal balance  and accordingly  require no additional allowance for loan and lease losses 
for purposes of determining the allowance for loan and lease losses  the company has made the determination to include these restructured loans in the regular pool in accordance with asc sfas no 

during the second quarter of  the company launched a loss mitigation program the special repayment plan for customers whose monthly net cash flows have been reduced and  cannot continue to make their mortgage payments 
the special repayment plan lowers the monthly payment of qualifying loans through the extension of the remaining maturity by years and  in some cases  a decrease of the interest rate 
the program  which is similar in nature to the home affordable modification program hamp recently launched by the us government  does not engage in a formal modification of the mortgage note  it simply enters into a legally binding payment plan with the customer that is valid through the end of the loan or a subsequent default  whichever occurs first 
the special repayment plan was designed to comply with all laws and regulations 
for purposes of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the related provision  the company has made the determination that the special repayment plan fits under the definition of a tdr and accordingly  considers the underlying loans to be impaired and under the scope of asc sfas no 

the company performs a cash flow analysis for these loans in which expected monthly payments are calculated using the new amortization schedules and interest rates are discounted using the loans original rate

on a case by case basis  the company may decide that a particular loan should be placed on non accrual status based on the borrower s financial condition  or  in the case of construction loans  if a given project is considered to be behind schedule or experiencing economic distress 
generally  when the loan is placed on non accrual  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is reversed 
such interest  if collected  is credited to income in the period of the recovery  and the loan returns to accrual when it becomes current and or collectibility is reasonably assured

non performing assets increased by million  or  during the growth in non performing assets was mainly driven by increases in the construction and residential mortgage portfolio as a direct consequence of the depressed condition of the housing market and overall macroeconomic trends in puerto rico 
non performing residential mortgage loans increased by million  or  when compared to december  the increase in delinquency is mostly attributable to economic stress being experienced by borrowers during the year ended december  macroeconomic pressure has significantly affected both early stage delinquency and cures from later delinquency segments

doral financial believes that the value of the oreo reflected on its consolidated statements of financial condition represents a reasonable estimate of the properties fair values  net of disposition costs 
the fair value of the oreo is normally determined on the basis of internal and external appraisals and physical inspections 
a loss is recognized for any initial write down to fair value less costs to sell 
any losses in the carrying value of the properties arising from periodic appraisals are charged to expense in the period incurred 
holding costs  property taxes  maintenance and other similar expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred 
detailed below is a roll forward of the company s oreo properties year ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of period additions sales retirement lower of cost or market adjustments balance at end of period during  the company sold oreo properties  representing million in unpaid balance

during  the company sold oreo properties  representing million in unpaid balance 
total proceeds amounted to million  representing the recovery of and of unpaid principal balance and book value  respectively 
gains and losses on sales of oreo are recognized in other expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company sold more oreo properties during due to marketing efforts  auctions  among others  but because of the current market conditions  gains were lower than those recognized in during  the company improved its foreclosure functions resulting in shorter foreclosure periods  and units are entering the oreo portfolio at faster rates than in previous years  which together with the deteriorating economic conditions in puerto rico explains the higher additions reflected in retirements represent properties charged off due to length of time they remained in portfolio 
generally the company does not maintain properties for periods in excess of five years for accounting purposes 
the increase in lower of cost or market adjustments is due to the economic conditions on the island  lower values received on appraisals and an estimated reserve for stale appraisals based on the current trend of appraisal values 

table of contents the company s portfolio of oreo properties was composed of the following categories for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands construction residential commercial real estate land secured balance at end of period during  non performing construction loans increased by million  or  compared to december  this increase is mainly related to loans with a combined outstanding balance of million placed in non accrual status as they did not meet the contractual terms as a result of the current downturn in the construction sector which has affected housing units sales in the market 
the construction portfolio is affected by the deterioration in the economy because the underlying loans repayment capacity is dependent on the ability to attract buyers and maintain housing prices 
in general  the termination in mid december of the incentive program established by the government of puerto rico slowed absorption compared to the trends experienced during during  construction projects financed by the company experienced lower levels of unit sales in comparison with corresponding period 
in optimizing its recovery of non performing construction loans  as of december   management has determined to foreclose approximately non performing residential development properties with an outstanding balance of approximately million in order to accelerate sales of the individual units 
most of these projects are in a mature stage of the development with approximately complete or close to completion 
if foreclosure is probable  accounting guidance requires the measurement of impairment to be based on the fair value of the collateral 
since current appraisals were not available on all these properties at year end  management determined its loss reserve estimates for these loans by estimating the fair value of the collateral 
in doing so  management considered a number of factors including the price at which individual units could be sold in the current market  the period of time over which the units would be sold  the estimated cost to complete the units  the risks associated with completing and selling the units  the required rate of return on investment a potential acquirer may have and current market interest rates in the puerto rico market 
management continues to evaluate the best course of action to optimize loan recoveries on all non performing properties  and will regularly assess all projects in choosing its course of action 
during the past two years  the company s construction loan portfolio has experienced a significant increase in default rates resulting from borrowers not being able to sell finished units within the loan term 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of the loans within the construction portfolio were considered non performing loans 
although the company is taking steps to mitigate the credit risk underlying these loans  their ultimate performance will be affected by each borrower s ability to complete the project  maintain the pricing level of the housing units within the project  and sell the inventory of units within a reasonable timeframe 
during and  doral financial did not enter into commitments to fund new construction loans for residential housing projects in puerto rico

as a result  the company increased its loan loss provisions to account for the increased levels of risk and their effect on the portfolio 
the company s allowance for loan and lease losses increased by million  or  between june  and december  as a result of the increase  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans receivable increased from to between june  and december  during and  puerto rico experienced deteriorating macroeconomics trends that contributed to continued increases in default levels in the retail business units 
portfolios underlying retail products including residential mortgage and small commercial real estate suffered significant increases in default rates 
the company has experienced worsening delinquencies in a number of its loan categories as a result of a puerto rico economy that has been in recession since the company has reflected the credit quality deterioration in its loan loss provisions  considering the increased levels of delinquencies and severity of loss on disposition of collateral 
perhaps the sector of the economy most affecting doral financial  directly and indirectly  is the sale of new home construction in puerto rico 
for the year ended december   the market absorption of new construction homes decreased significantly  principally due to the termination of the tax incentive provided by law late in the fourth quarter of this circumstance required modifications in absorption estimates  resulting in higher loan loss provisions 
furthermore  the slowdown in new construction has resulted in lost jobs  which has further increased mortgage and commercial loan delinquencies as the overall level of economic activity declines 
the company expects that absorption will continue to be at low levels due to the current economic environment 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan and lease losses was million  an increase of million from million as of december  the allowance for loan and lease losses was of period end loans receivable at december   compared with at december  the provision for loan and lease losses increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  for  the provision of all portfolios increased except for the provision for the commercial real estate loan portfolio  which is the portfolio where a higher provision was established at the end of the level of the provision in was largely driven by higher delinquencies primarily in the construction  residential mortgage and commercial loan portfolios during the period and continued deterioration in the puerto rico economy 
mortgage lending is the company s principal line of business and has historically reflected significant recoveries and low levels of losses 
nevertheless  due to current economic conditions in puerto rico  and increases in non performing loans and loss severities in this portfolio  the company increased its allowance during non performing residential mortgage loans increased million  or  and the related allowance for loan and lease losses increased million or during the year 

table of contents the general allowance for residential mortgage loans is calculated based on the probability that loans within different delinquency buckets will default and  in the case of default  the extent of these losses is what the company expects to realize 
in determining the probabilities of default  the company considers recent experience of rolls of loans from one delinquency bucket into the next 
recent roll rates show that the proportion of loans rolling into subsequent buckets has been following an increasing trend throughout the year 
for purposes of forecasting the future behavior of the portfolio  doral financial determined that it should only use the roll rates of relatively recent months  which show a more aggressive deteriorating trend that those in older periods 
using the older historical performance would yield lower probabilities of default that may not reflect recent macroeconomic trends 
severity losses are calculated based on historical results from foreclosure and ultimate disposition of collateral 
historical results are adjusted for the company s expectation of housing prices 
severity assumptions for the residential portfolio range between and depending on the different loan types and loan to value ratios  and up to for second mortgages 
the construction loan portfolio continued to decrease  consistent with the company s strategy to exit the construction business in construction non performing loans increased million  or  of which million resulted from one large loan related to the company s mainland portfolio 
during  the company recorded a loan loss provision of million for this portfolio to reflect the loan quality deterioration  partially related to loans determined to be impaired during the allowance on this portfolio decreased million during due to the decrease in the balance of loans outstanding and to the charge off of the portion of loans determined to be uncollectible and for which provisions of million had been recorded 
the allowance for loan and lease losses on the land secured portfolio decreased million during also due to net charge offs of million during the year 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio decreased during since the company is not actively lending in this line of business 
non performing commercial real estate loans increased million in as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions in puerto rico 
the allowance for loan and lease losses for this portfolio decreased million during due to net charge offs of million and the recovery of provision expenses resulting from a refinement of estimates that management believes better reflect the incurred losses of the portfolio 
this decrease was partially offset by increased provisions partially related to loans determined to be impaired in the commercial non real estate portfolio increased primarily as a result of the launch of the middle market syndicated lending unit in the second half of non performing commercial non real estate loans decreased million during the year and the allowance for the portfolio reflected a minor reduction for the year 
the consumer and lease financing portfolios continued to decrease consistent with the company s exit strategy for these business lines 
non performing consumer loans are stable and the allowance has decreased in the consumer portfolio as non performing loan balances are charged off 
in total for the year  the balance of non performing loans outstanding increased million  and the company provided million for loan losses 
in addition  the company s charge offs were million  resulting in a net increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses of million 
the allowance for loan and lease losses for the construction loans  land secured and commercial real estate portfolios decreased by million  million and million  respectively  as the rate of identified portfolio deterioration reflected in the provision  partially related to loans determined to be impaired in  was less than the losses confirmed and recognized or charged off during the year 
net charge offs for the year ended december  of million exceeded net charge offs for of million by million  or 
higher charge offs in resulted largely from the increased volume of residential loans foreclosed upon and certain other loans determined to be uncollectible during the period 
the company has focused attention on shortening the period from default to foreclosure 
the foreclosure process in puerto rico is more time consuming than in the mainland us due to elements in the puerto rico law 
the company evaluates impaired loans and the related valuation allowance based on asc sfas no 

commercial and construction loans over million that are classified as substandard are evaluated individually for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and 
table of contents events it is probable that the borrower will not be able to fulfill its obligation according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is generally measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
this is consistent with management s intention to maximize proceeds from the disposition of foreclosed assets as opposed to rapid liquidation 
accordingly  the market value of appraisals is used 
should the appraisal show a deficiency  the company records a specific reserve for the underlying loan 
if foreclosure is probable  accounting guidance requires the measurement of impairment to be based on the fair value of the collateral 
since current appraisals were not available on all these properties at year end  management determined its loss reserve estimates for these loans by estimating the fair value of the collateral 
in doing so  management considered a number of factors including the price at which individual units could be sold in the current market  the period of time over which the units would be sold  the estimated cost to complete the units  the risks associated with completing and selling the units  the required rate of return on investment a potential acquirer may have and current market interest rates in the puerto rico market 
in optimizing its recovery on non performing construction loans as of december   management has determined to foreclose approximately non performing residential development properties with an outstanding balance of approximately million in order to accelerate sales of the individual units 
most of these projects are in a mature stage of the development with approximately complete or close to completion 
accordingly  impairment of these loans and determination of required loan loss reserves was measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
management continues to evaluate the best course of action to optimize loan recoveries on all non performing properties  and will regularly assess all projects in choosing its course of action 
the following table summarizes the company s loans individually reviewed for impairment excluding mortgage loans which are not individually reviewed for impairment and the related allowance in thousands impaired loans with allowance impaired loans without allowance total impaired loans related allowance average impaired loans the increase in balance of impaired loans with allowance during  was primarily related to million of loans under the company s special repayment plan srp 
as part of the regular loan workout cycle  the company charges off the portion of specific reserves for impaired loans that it considers being confirmed losses 
accordingly  certain loans considered impaired and measured for specific reserve in accordance with asc sfas no 
are carried at an unpaid balance that has already been reduced by charge offs  and therefore  carry a relatively lower dollar allowance 
under some circumstances  the economics of a particular credit relationship suggest that the underlying loans are sufficiently collateralized and that no specific reserve is necessary 
asc sfas no 
prohibits the allocation of general reserves for those loans for which an impairment analysis has been conducted and for which no specific reserve is required 
as of december   doral financial s construction and commercial real estate portfolio includes million of impaired loans that are adequately collateralized and  accordingly  carry no specific reserves 
doral financial records an allowance for all performing loans and non performing small balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages  consumer  commercial and construction loans under million on a group basis under the provisions of asc  contingencies loss contingencies recognition  previously sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

for such loans  the allowance is determined considering the historical charge off experience of each loan category and delinquency levels as well as economic data  such as interest rate levels  inflation and the strength of the housing market in the areas where the company operates 

table of contents generally  the percentage of the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans will not remain constant due to the nature of doral financial s portfolio of loans  which are primarily collateralized by real estate 
the collateral for each non performing mortgage loan is analyzed to determine potential loss exposure  and  in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
on an ongoing basis  management monitors the loan portfolio and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance  management considers such factors as default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
allocated specific and general reserves are supplemented by a macroeconomic or emerging risk reserve 
this portion of the total allowance for loan and lease losses reflects management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly reflected in the loss factors used in the determination of the allowance 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the macroeconomic and emerging risk allowance include national and local economic trends  industry conditions within the portfolios  recent loan portfolio performance  loan growth  changes in underwriting criteria and the regulatory and public policy environment 
the following table sets forth information concerning the composition of doral financial s allowance for loan and lease losses by loan category and whether the allowance and related provisions were calculated individually through the requirements of asc sfas no

recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to expenses and credited to the allowance in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon its evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
while management believes that the current allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
if economic conditions change substantially from the assumptions used by doral financial in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses further increases in the allowance may be required 
counterparty risk the company has exposure to many different counterparties  and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  and other institutional clients 
loans  derivatives  investments  repurchase agreements  other borrowings  receivables  among others including the lbi transaction expose the company to counterparty risk 
many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client 
in addition  the company s credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to the company 
there can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 

table of contents the company has procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among its counterparties 
the company requests collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitors these on a regular basis 
nevertheless  market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by the company and result in losses 
operational risk operational risk includes the potential for financial losses resulting from failed or inadequate controls 
operational risk is inherent in every aspect of business operations  and can result from a range of factors including human judgments  process or system failures  or business interruptions 
operational risk is present in all of doral financial s business processes  including financial reporting 
the company has adopted a policy governing the requirements for operational risk management activities 
this policy defines the roles and responsibilities for identifying key risks  key risk indicators  estimation of probabilities and magnitudes of potential losses and monitoring trends 
overview of operational risk management doral financial has a corporate wide chief risk officer  who is responsible for implementing the process of managing the risks faced by the company

general business  economic and political conditions  puerto rico economy and fiscal condition the company s business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in puerto rico and the united states 
significant business and economic conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation and the strength or weakness of the puerto rico and us economies and housing markets 
if any of these conditions deteriorate  the company s business and earnings could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household income could decrease the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their loans  or  a dramatically rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans and negatively affect the value of the company s investments and loans 
inflation also generally results in increases in general and administrative expenses 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
please refer to risk management above for a discussion of the effects of changes of interest rates on the company s operations 
markets in the united states and elsewhere have experienced extreme volatility and disruption for nearly two years  continuing through the year ended december  the united states  europe and japan entered into recessions during that persisted through most of  despite governmental intervention in the world s major economies 
the company s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  its financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
puerto rico s economy is currently in a recession that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that ended june   a fiscal year in which puerto rico s real gross national product grew by only 
for fiscal years 
table of contents and  puerto rico s real gross national product contracted by and  respectively 
according to the latest information published by the planning board in january  the contraction continued into fiscal year with a reduction in puerto rico s real gross national product of 
while the recessionary trend was expected to continue in current fiscal year  the planning board announced in august that the expected positive impact of the united states and local economic stimulus measures generally discussed below should outweigh the expected negative impact of the fiscal stabilization plan also discussed below  and revised its projections for fiscal year to reflect an increase of in puerto rico s real gross national product 
the revised forecast also considers the effect on the puerto rico economy of general global economic conditions  the us economy  the volatility of oil prices  interest rates and the behavior of local exports  including expenditures by visitors 
the planning board  however  is currently working on a revised fiscal year gross national product forecast that would take into account the recently announced preliminary results for fiscal year  the economic impact of a delay in the disbursement of funds from arra  and other economic factors that may require a downward revision of their projection 
the revised projection may show a continued reduction in gross national product during fiscal year the planning board expects to complete and announce the revised projection during the first quarter of future growth of the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the united states economy  the relative stability of the price of oil imports  the exchange value of the united states dollar  the level of interest rates  the effectiveness of changes to local tax incentive legislation  and the continuing economic uncertainty generated by the puerto rico government s fiscal condition described below 
fiscal condition 
puerto rico is experiencing a fiscal crisis as a result of the structural imbalance between recurring government revenues and expenses 
the structural imbalance was exacerbated during fiscal years and  with recurring government expenses significantly higher than recurring revenues  which have declined as a result of the multi year economic contraction mentioned above 
in order to bridge the deficit resulting from the structural imbalance  the puerto rico government has used non recurring solutions  such as borrowing from gdb or in the bond market  and postponing the payment of various government expenses  such as payments to suppliers and utilities providers 
the structural deficit for fiscal year was estimated to be billion 
rating downgrades 
the continued fiscal imbalance led to successive downgrades in the commonwealth of puerto rico s general obligation debt ratings  from baa by moody s and a by s p in fiscal year to baa by moody s and bbb by s p currently 
each of the rating agencies has a stable outlook on the commonwealth s general obligation debt 
fiscal stabilization plan 
the new puerto rico government administration  which commenced on january  and controls the executive and legislative branches of government  has developed and commenced implementing a multi year fiscal stabilization and economic reconstruction plan designed to achieve fiscal balance and restore economic growth 
the fiscal stabilization plan seeks to achieve budgetary balance on or before fiscal year  while addressing expected fiscal deficits in the intervening years through the implementation of a number of initiatives  including the following i a billion operating expense reduction plan during fiscal year  through government reorganization and reduction of operating expenses  including payroll as the main component of government expenditures  ii a combination of temporary and permanent tax increases  coupled with additional tax enforcement measures  and iii a bond issuance program through cofina 
before the temporary measures expire in  the administration intends to design and adopt a comprehensive reform of the tax system and a long term economic development plan to complement the economic reconstruction and supplemental stimulus initiatives described below 
the proceeds expected to be obtained from cofina bond issuance program will be used to repay existing government debt including debts with gdb  finance operating expenses of the commonwealth for fiscal years through and for fiscal year  to the extent included in the government s annual budget for such fiscal year  including costs related to the implementation of a workforce reduction plan  the funding of an economic stimulus plan  as described below  and for other purposes to address the fiscal imbalance while the fiscal stabilization plan is being implemented 
the fiscal stabilization plan seeks to safeguard the investment grade ratings of the commonwealth s general obligation debt and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth 
legislation was enacted during authorizing the implementation of all the measures in the fiscal stabilization plan 
economic reconstruction plan 
the current puerto rico government administration has also developed and commenced implementing a short term economic reconstruction plan 
the cornerstone of this plan is the implementation of us federal and local economic stimuli 
puerto rico will benefit from the arra enacted by the us government to provide a stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the global economic downturn 
puerto 
table of contents rico expects to receive approximately billion from arra during the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year  which includes tax relief  expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions  and domestic spending in education  health care  and infrastructure  among other measures 
the administration will seek to complement the us federal stimulus with additional short and medium term supplemental stimulus measures seeking to address specific local challenges and providing investment in strategic areas 
these measures include a local million economic stimulus plan to supplement the federal plan 
the local stimulus is composed of three main elements i capital improvements  ii stimulus for small and medium sized businesses  and iii consumer relief in the form of direct payments to retirees  mortgage debt restructuring for consumers that face risk of default  and consumer stimulus for the purchase of housing 
in addition  to further stimulate economic development and cope with the fiscal crisis  the administration established a legal framework via legislation approved in june to authorize and promote the use of public private partnerships to finance and develop infrastructure projects and operate and manage certain public assets 
the new administration is also developing a comprehensive long term economic development plan aimed at improving puerto rico s overall competitiveness and business environment and increasing private sector participation in the puerto rico economy 
as part of this plan  the administration will emphasize i the simplification and shortening of the permitting and licensing process  ii the strengthening of the labor market by encouraging greater labor force participation and bringing out of date labor laws and regulations in line with us and international standards and iii the adoption of a new energy policy that seeks to lower energy costs and reduce energy price volatility by reducing puerto rico s dependence on fossil fuels  particularly oil  through the promotion of diverse  renewable energy technologies 
one of these goals was accomplished on december   when the puerto rico governor signed act
